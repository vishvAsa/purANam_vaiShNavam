      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/27/samkarshana%e2%80%99s-deeds/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the 67th chapter of the harivaMsha&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When balarAma was cavorting with his wives and girlfriends and enjoying a pitcher of vAruNi beer, dvivida the mighty ape made obscene gestures. balarAma’s eyes rolled in languor, he sang loudly and he moved like a male elephant in musth. The great ape was a student of sugrIva in the days of yore and had learnt great deeds in battle. The vAnara was spreading much havoc and raping women of the yadu’s feudatories in revenge for the killing of his friends from pragjyotiSha, naraka and mura. He would capture citizens of the yadu’s feudatories and seal them in caverns by blocking the entrances with stones, like a wasp imprisons spiders. He was also smashing cow-pens, setting fire to villages and throwing firebrands down mine shafts in the Anarta province. In the west coast he churned up the water and created floods in the coastal villages. He also destroyed trees in the forests of the yAdavas and hammered the vanAdhyakShas. He then advanced to the shrauta yards of the garga bhAradvAjas and other Brahmins and desecrated the sacrificial altars by urinating or defecating into them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had reason to do a reading of the syamantakopAkhyAna from the harivaMsha. It causes rifts between many yadu-s including between kR^iShNa &amp;amp; balabhadra. The angered balabhadra goes away to the land of the videha-s after blasting kR^iShNa. It was there that he is said to have tutored the mighty kuru hero duryodhana in gadA-yuddha.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the syamantaka is handed to akrUra babhru who had cunningly taken it from satyabhAmA&amp;rsquo;s father even as kR^iShNa, balarAma&amp;amp; sAtyakI were making funerary offerings for their cousins, the pANDu-s, at vAraNAvata. satyabhAmA arrives at vAraNAvata on her chariot to inform them of his killing by akrUra&amp;rsquo;s ally shatadhanvan. I believe that place is not far from the archaeological site where the famous chariot-like cart indicating early Indo-Aryan presence/influence in India was recovered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
