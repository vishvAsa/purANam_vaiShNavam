So, in <em>Agnihotra</em>, when they offer <em>aahuti</em>, they offer to both the gods <em>Agni</em> and <em>Surya</em>. Because when there are two respectable people, if we show respect to one and do not show respect to the other, it is as if the person to whom you have shown respect also is direspected, because the other person was not shown due respect. So, both Agni and Surya should be given <em>aahuti</em>. In morning and evening, for both aahuti is to be given.

This <em>jyotischakra</em> is rotating in the western direction. In the great axle, being held by the reins by <em>Dhruva</em>, the smaller axle and yoke are connected to other pair of <em>rashmis</em>. The two reins, by pulling towards and pulling against, according to <em>Dakshinaayana</em> and <em>Uttaraayana</em>, either to the northern direction or southern direction, one <em>mandala rekhaa</em> at a time, either the top or bottom portion, going up and going down, he is going round and covering the entire circumference. Inside part is near <em>Meru</em>, and outside part is near <em>Maanasottara</em>. Slowly, he is moving towards the eastern direction. In one month, he covers two and a quarter <em>nakshatraas</em>, which is one <em>raashi</em>. 183 solar days, he moves around in the same way. He will reach the edge on the great axle; and in the <em>nakshatra mandala</em>, thirteen and a half <em>nakshatraas</em>, six <em>raashis</em>, he covers this much distance. In this way, 366 days (includes nights), two <em>ayanaas</em>, six <em>rutus</em>, twelve months - one solar year is divided like this. In this 366 times, the rising and setting in the western direction happens. Once on the great axle he goes up and down, 27 <em>nakshatraas</em>, 12 <em>raashis</em>, the potters wheel is rotating, and insect is rotating opposite; in the same way, the Sun&rsquo;s movement is happening. Covering the *nakshatra *<em>mandala</em>, daily moving in the western direction, and in the other direction, he moves by himself, the planets also move like that. Mars, <em>Angaaraka</em>, is located at a distance from the Sun; it can happen in the other direction also. Moon and others which are near the Sun, are being covered by the rays of the Sun; rising and setting of the moon happen because of the nearness to the Sun. It is said to enter into Sun&rsquo;s mandala, during the setting of the moon, and is <em>chandrodaya</em> happens when the Sun is at a distance; this is all told in <em>Shruti</em> and <em>Puraana</em>, which is not opposed to what is told here; and can be learnt from the <em>Jyotisshaastra</em>. <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> makes and interesting remark here - The current year when this commentary was written, he is saying that there are 366 days now, and according to the <em>Kali</em> measure, 4,400 years, 365 and a quarter days.</p>
<p>Now, it is 5120 after <em>Kali Yuga. Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s</em> time is second half of the twelfth Page <strong>129</strong> of **297<br>

In the same way, starting from <em>Tulaa raashi</em>, six <em>raashis</em> are said to be night. In between the <em>vishuvaas</em>, how the day and night increase and decrease is being told - the durations, space covered by the <em>raashis</em> are said to be different. We saw earlier that <em>Meena</em> and <em>Mesha</em> are small, so it takes less time to cover the two *raashis *<em>Meena</em> and <em>Mesha</em>. <em>Vrushabha</em> and <em>Kumbha</em> are a little more than that, so that it takes more time for the Sun to cover these two. <em>Makara</em> and <em>Mithuna</em> are still more. <em>Simha</em> and <em>Vruschika</em> are still longer. <em>Dhanus</em> and <em>Karkataka</em> are longer. <em>Kanya</em> and <em>Tula</em> are equal. Based on this, whichever <em>raasi</em> is at the day beginning, the day and night durations keep changing. This is why we see differences in duration of day and night.</p>

Based on this, we say that he covers so many <em>muhoortaas</em> in so many <em>nakshatraas</em>, <em>raashis</em>; this is only figurative, <em>oupachaarika</em>. The durations for which we see the Sun and don&rsquo;t see the Sun, accordingly we count the <em>nakshatraas</em> covered in the particular time. The <em>raashis</em> which are of smaller duration, *Meena, Mesha, Vrushabha, Kumbha *- whenever these <em>raashis</em> are coming in the beginning of the day, the days are smaller, and nights are longer. In <em>Uttaraayana</em>, the days are longer. All these things - increase and decrease in day and night duration - are seen by the works of <em>Puraanaas, Pouraanikaas</em> who lived in <em>Kuru, Naimishaaranya, Kaashmira</em>; in these places they have a 12 inch nail, when the see the image of this, this is 8.5 inches in the mid day, 12 noon of <em>vishuvat dinam</em>, mid day of <em>Dakshinaayana</em> or <em>Uttaraayana</em>. In <em>Uttaraayana</em>, the other half <em>raashis</em> are coming - *Makara, Simha, Vrushchika *- because of this, Sun takes longer to cover; these days are longer.</p>

In <em>Uttaraayana</em>, he takes longer to cover the day. This is known through all the calculations in <em>Jyotisshaastra</em>. At the middle of <em>Uttaraayana</em> and *Dakshinaayana, *<em>vishuvat</em> is when day and night are equal.

At the beginning and end, all the <em>grahaas</em> are joining together - <em>Kruta, Treta</em>, etc., so many <em>ahoraatraas</em>, when the Sun is in this particular <em>tithi</em>, or moon is in this particular <em>nakshatra</em>, this <em>samvatsara</em> starts.

These are the four ways of measuring time, where <em>Soura, Saavana, Chaandra, Naakshatra</em>; these are said to be forming <em>Puraana</em>, and one more <em>yuga</em> will start, just like the previous. <em>Garga</em> is also quoted - At <em>Maagha maasa, Shukla paksha, pratipat</em>, the Sun and Moon rise together; first one is said to be <em>Samvatsara</em>, having <em>Agni</em> as the <em>devataa</em>. When Sun is in *Maagha *<em>maasa, Shukla paksha, trayodashi</em>, this is said to be *Vaasara. Samvatsara, Parivatsara, *<em>Idvatsara, Anuvatsara</em> and <em>Vatsara</em> are the names of the five years. In <em>Vedaas</em>, third one is said to be <em>Idaa vatsara</em>, here it is said as <em>Idvatsara</em>. Fourth one is <em>Anuvatsara</em>, having <em>Indra</em> as the <em>devataa</em>. Fifth one is said to be <em>Idvatsara</em> in the <em>Vedaas</em>, having <em>Mrutyu</em> as the <em>devataa</em>, here it is said to be <em>Vatsara</em>. At the beginning of five years, all the four *Soura, Saavana, Chaandra, Naakshatra *- all coincide, and again start. The five years are denoted by the names *Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idvatsara, *<em>Anuvatsara</em> and <em>Vatsara</em>. At the end of the five years, they again start. These are the four types of <em>maasaas</em> by which <em>yuga</em> is divided. *Lagadaachaarya *(who has written the <em>Vedaanga Jyoutisha</em>) has said the same thing. ***</p>

In the <em>Maagha maasa, Jyeshtha</em>, when the Sun moves, in the middle of <em>Pushkara</em>, he moves in the <em>Dakshinaayana</em>. When he returns from <em>Dakshinaayana</em>, in the middle, <em>Vishuva</em>, he will start moving towards the north. In <em>Shraavana maasa</em>, he reaches the north edge. There is a notation of three <em>veethis, veethi-traya, Ujjayini, Lankaa, Dakshina</em>. What is told here - *Mesha, *<em>Tulaa, Vishuva, Makara (Nakra)</em> (in <em>Uttaraayana</em>), *Karkata *(in <em>Dakshinaayana</em>), what is told here, is told in the older times. In 3600 <em>Kaliyuga</em>, it was like that. Now, presently, in 4400 <em>Kali Yuga, Vishuva</em> is seen in the 12th day, even before the *Makara *<em>maasa</em>, and <em>Karka</em>, even before the Sun reaches them, <em>Vishuva</em> is observed.</p>

There was also a time when <em>Maargasheersha</em> was at the beginning of the year, that was the time when <em>Triveethi</em> was there. Some people say that <em>Maargasheersha</em> is at the beginning of the year. <em>Kaatyaayana</em> has said that <em>Maargasheersha</em> is the beginning, and from there, two two months are one <em>rutu</em> each. <em>Amarasimha</em> also says a similar thing. <em>Mrugashira</em> is also called <em>Agrahaayani</em>, beginning of the year, *agram ayanam *<em>asya</em>; even the <em>Poornima</em> there is said to be <em>Agrahaayani</em>. Now, we say that the beginning of year is <em>Maargasheersha</em>, is because of performing certain <em>vrataas</em>. In <em>Vedaas</em>, there is also a mention that <em>Phalguni</em> is the beginning of the year, this is because <em>yaaga</em> is performed at that time. <em>Madhu, Maaghava</em>, what the <em>Shrutis</em> tell, the year starts with <em>Chaitra Shukla pratipat</em>; this is established in *Shrutis, Smrutis, *<em>ganita, vyavahaara, loka</em>, etc. One has to see <em>Shrutis, Smrutis, Ganita</em>, and all of that, and then establish the days.</p>
<p>During <em>Tiruppavai</em>, we do <em>anusandhaana</em> that <em>Maargasheersha</em> is the <em>Usha: kaala</em>, that&rsquo;s why it is very sacred. ***</p>

Even at later times, or any other time, where the Sun and Moon are positioned like this, this is <em>Vishuva</em>, a very auspicious time, and very special time. Earlier, it was end of <em>Meena</em> and <em>Kanyaa</em>, when Sun and Moon were positioned, it was said to be a very auspicious time for charity.

eshah ||</strong></em> The <em>dakshina maarga</em> is said to be <em>Dhoomaadi</em>. There are two - *Devayaana *<em>(Archiraadi)</em> and <em>Pitruyaana (Dhoomaadi)</em>. It is told in <em>Chaandogya Upanishad</em> that those who do meditation on the <em>Paramaatman, Parabrahma upaasanaa</em>, when they meditate upon the <em>Tapah shabda vaachya Paramaatman</em> with <em>shraddhaa</em>, they attain the <em>Archiraadi maarga</em> and go to <em>moksha</em>. Those who live in the villages, as householders, who perform *Ishtaa *(various <em>yajnya yaagaas</em>, sacrifices), *Poortaa *(humanitarian deeds like building water tanks), *Datta *(giving <em>daana</em>, charity), they go to the deity of Smoke, <em>dhoomam</em>, the <em>Dhoomaabhimaani devataa</em>. From there, they go to the deity of night. From there, to the deity of <em>Krishna paksha</em>. From there to the *abhimaani *<em>devataa</em> of <em>Dakshinaayana</em>. From there, they go to deity of <em>Samvatsara</em>. From there, they go to the world of manes, <em>Pitruloka</em>. From <em>Pitruloka</em>, they go to the deity of <em>Aakaasha</em>, then to the Moon. This is the food of the gods, the gods eat him, the gods get the service done by these people, so they use them like animals, as told in the <em>Upanishads</em>. After having spent all the <em>punyaas</em> accumulated, in performing <em>Ishtaa, Poortaa, Datta</em>, till the <em>punya</em> is spent, they live there, they serve the gods, live in their worlds and enjoy. When the <em>punya</em> is completed, exhausted, they return by the same route, up to <em>Aakaasha</em>. From <em>Aakaasha</em>, they go to <em>Vaayu</em>, then to <em>Dhooma</em>. This is the <em>Panchaagni Vidyaa</em> told in *Chaandogya Upanishad. *<em>Dhooma, raatri, bahula, Dakshinaayana, Aakaasha</em>, Moon, <em>Diva</em>, and after that, when they come back, they go through <em>Aakaasha</em> first, then *Vaayu, Dhooma, Abhra *(the previous state of cloud), then the cloud itself, then rains, then <em>udbijya, vreehi</em>, grains, when a person eats that grain, and unites with a woman, it gets transferred to woman, and they are born again. This is told in <em>Panchaagni vidyaa</em>. Those who go by the <em>Pitruyaana</em>, they take this path. Those who take <em>Devayaana</em>, they go to <em>Moksha</em>.</p>
<p>Here, another <em>Devayaana</em> is told. ***</p>

<p><em>Bhooh, Bhuvah, Suvah, Mahah</em>- this is the fourth one, but with respect to <em>Bhoomi</em>, this is the third place. That is why this is told as <em>Truteeyaa</em>. To the north of the <em>rishis</em>, and also above, <em>Vishnu pada</em> which is supported by <em>Dhruva</em> is there. If you take the seven worlds - <em>Sapta lokaas, (Bhooh, Bhuvah, Suvah, Mahah, Janah, Tapah, Satyam</em>), this is said to be the position of the <em>hrudaya. Vairaaja</em> is <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, the <em>Viraat purusha. Antaryaami, Parabrahma</em> is located in the *hrudaya *- this is the place where Vishnu lives. The <em>moksha</em> told in this <em>Vishnu pada</em> is <em>Krama mukti</em>; those who are here enjoy much more pleasures and happiness compared to even <em>svarga</em>, even though it is below <em>Satya loka. Krama mukti</em> means that they gradually do <em>upaasanaa</em>, and then attain <em>moksha</em>. Those who live there, in order, go and attain <em>Brahma loka</em>, and along with <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, they also get liberated. Those who are in <em>Vishnu pada</em>, if they perform <em>upaasanaa</em> there itself, and attain that <em>jnyaana</em>, they also can get liberated. <em>Vishnu pada</em> itself is not the place attained by <em>muktaas</em>; it is not <em>saakshaat Parama Pada</em>. This is one of the steps in attaining <em>moksha</em>.</p>
<p>The word <em>Parama pada</em> comes here, which is explained in the commentary. The next <em>shlokaas</em> tell about the worlds above the three worlds.</p>
<p>We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 8, where we studied about the various <em>lokaas</em> where <em>rishis</em> live, the <em>Vishnu Pada</em>, which is also told by the name <em>Paramapada</em> in these <em>shlokaas</em>. How the people who do <em>Ashvamedha yaaga</em>, go and enjoy the <em>svargaas</em>, till the <em>naimittika pralaya</em> time. ***</p>

From the sky, water which was present outside started flowing through <em>Vishnu Paada</em>, it entered the skies.

This is also told in *Vishnu *<em>Dharmottara Puraana</em>. When <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s Paada</em> started growing, it broke through the <em>Brahmaanda</em>, and there was a huge hole. The whole <em>Brahmaanda</em> was occupied by the waters which were outside; they destroy all the ten sins. Through that hole, water entered into the anda, inside the Cosmic Egg. In another <em>puraana</em>, it is said that when <em>Vishnu Paada</em> started growing, when it entered *Satya Loka, Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> did <em>Abhisheka</em> to that <em>Paada</em>, and that became <em>Gangaa</em> river later. <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> did <em>Abhisheka</em> to the <em>Paada</em> with his <em>kamandalu jala</em>. At another place, it is told that <em>Dharma</em> itself became a river, and took the form of water, and became <em>Ganga</em> river. What is told in another place is that *Trivikrama *<em>Paada</em> was so huge that the water in <em>Brahma&rsquo;s kamandalu</em> was not sufficient, he was doing <em>Abhisheka</em> with that; in order to complete that <em>Abhisheka, Dharma</em> itself took the form of water; that was also not sufficient; when the Cosmic Egg was broken, waters which were outside also came through that opening in the Egg, touched the Feet of Vishnu, and came to the world, and became <em>Gangaa</em>. ***</p>

One who hears about the <em>Gangaa</em> gets a great desire to see, take bath. One who has a great desire, goes and touches the waters, the next step is to drink the waters of <em>Gangaa</em>.

For whatever reason one sees with great devotion the <em>Gangaa</em> river, <em>Gangaa</em> destroys the sins of hundred <em>kulaas</em> of such a person. Those who touch the waters of the river with great devotion, even once, <em>Gangaa</em> will bless thousand <em>kulaas</em> of them to cross over the <em>samsaara</em>. Dharma itself has taken the form of water, the <em>Gangaa</em> river, one who drinks that with great devotion, even once, <em>Gangaa</em> will make sure that ten thousand <em>kulaas</em> of them will cross over the ocean of <em>samsaara</em>, this is for sure. In the sacred river <em>Gangaa</em>, with great devotion, when one does *Avagaaha snaana *(completely immersing in the waters), one lakh <em>kulaas</em> of them will be blessed with crossing over the <em>samsaara</em>. Those who do <em>seva</em> every day with great devotion, and drink the sacred waters, ten lakh <em>kulaas</em> of them will cross over <em>samsaara</em>.

Even if situated 1000 <em>yojanaas</em> away, if one says with devotion during the three <em>sandhyaa kaalaas</em>, he will attain <em>Parama Gati</em>.

This conclusion is told to tell about the greatness of the <em>Paada.

They originate from some other river, or from a hill, which are very insignificant compared to the <em>Paada</em> of <em>Mahaa Vishnu</em>; this is indicated by <em>&rsquo;tu&rsquo; shabda. Gangaa</em> cannot be compared with ordinary rivers. Those who compare <em>Gangaa</em> river with other ordinary rivers, they commit sin, <em>dosha. Gangaa</em> has got <em>Vaishnavee Shakti</em>, coming from <em>Vishnu Paada</em>; those who think that <em>Gangaa</em> is similar to other rivers, one should not live with, or come in contact with such people. <em>Gangaa</em> should not even be told as <em>nadi, Gangaa</em> is so sacred; this is told in <em>Bhavishyat Puraana</em>.</p>
