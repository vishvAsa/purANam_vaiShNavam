<p>We just concluded <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 12, where we studied about the Moon, how the Sun gives <em>trupti</em> to everyone on the earth, through the plants, through the rains caused by the Sun. Through his rays, the <em>amrutamaya chandra</em>, the Moon, where Page <strong>189</strong> of **297<br>

In this way, the Sun is responsible for satisfying all of them, the <em>devaas, pitrus</em>, and the <em>manushyaas</em>. We saw the Moon&rsquo;s description, about how every planet has a ratha, chariot - this is going to be told now.</p>
<p>The <em>devaas</em> consume <em>amruta</em> from the Moon only. During <em>Amaavaasya</em>, the <em>pitrus</em> consume. Through his <em>prakaasha</em>, as well as bringing joy to everyone, the Moon brings happiness to all the plants also, the humans, insects, etc. The Moon brings joy because of his pleasantness in the nights.</p>

In this world, which is mixed with sentient and non-sentient, one who knows himself without any <em>jnyaana</em> or <em>pramaana</em>, having <em>jnyaana</em> only as the <em>svaroopa</em>, his essential nature is of consciousness, and he is indestructible, and that is why he is called as <em>Asti</em>; and the non-sentient part of the world, and it attains many forms due to the modifications it undergoes, because of the <em>karmaas</em> of the sentients, in order to give them the experience of the fruits of the <em>karmaas, (deha, insriyaas, vishayaas</em>, are all given), which are all modifications of <em>prakruti</em> only, it undergoes destruction (there is no <em>svaroopa naasha</em>, but there is <em>svaroopa parinaama</em>), it is called by the word <em>Naasti</em>. Both these are <em>shareera</em> for <em>Vaasudeva</em>, who is <em>Parabrahma</em>; both these have <em>Parabrahma, Vaasudeva</em> as their <em>aatma</em>. This is going to be told briefly.</p>
<p><em>Svasmai bhaasamaanastvam</em> is told.</p>
<p>This world has two parts - sentient and non-sentient.</p>
<p><em>Shareera</em> is because of the three relationships - *Yasya chetanasya yat **dravyam, sarvaatmanaa svaarthe niyantum dhaarayitum cha yat *<em>shakyam</em> that <em>sheshataika svaroopam cha tat tasya shareeram, itarah shareeri</em>. This is the <em>lakshana</em> told by <em>Sri Bhaashyakaarar</em> in <em>Sri Bhaashya</em> and *Vedaarthasangraha. *<em>Shareera</em> is a <em>dravya</em>, under the control of the <em>shareeri</em>, that which is controlled, supported and meant for the purpose of the <em>shareeri</em>. One who controls, supports and is the Master, is the <em>shareeri</em>. This is the relationship. Everything is having Him as the self, this way, everything is His <em>shareera</em>. He is <em>aatma</em> for everything.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important <em>shloka</em>, where the principle which is to be understood for all the remaining <em>shlokaas</em> is explained. What we have to understand first is explained. The next ten <em>shlokaas</em> are commented by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> in <em>Sri Bhaashya</em>. The commentary which we see here in <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s vyaakhyaana</em>, is exactly same as what is found in <em>Sri Bhaashya</em>, 99 percent same. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 12, Shloka 37: <br>
Yat ambu vaishnavah kaayah tato vipra vasundharaa |<br>

<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **born. It has the mountains, oceans, etc.</p>
<p>This is told in the <em>Shrutis</em>, for creation, *Aatmanah aakaashah sambhootah, aakaashaat *<em>vaayuh, vaayoragnih, angeraapah, apbhyah pruthivee, pruthivyaa oshadhayah</em>. From waters, <em>pruthivi</em> is created, and it has got plants, rivers, etc. Water itself is the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vishnu</em>. Earth which has come from water is also in the same way.</p>
<p><em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em> is a very important concept in *Vedaanta. Bhinna pravrutti *<em>nimittaanaam shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih saamaanaadhikaranyam</em>. This is told by the grammarian <em>KaiyaTa</em>. We agree with this definition and <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> explains everything according to this. <em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em> means words which are in the same <em>vibhakti</em>, indicate different <em>visheshana</em>, which denote different aspects of the same qualified object. A single object can be qualified by multiple attributes, which are not opposed to each other. <em>Visheshanaanaam vyaavartakatvaat</em>, is a commonly understood thing. Attributes actually eliminate others. If we say &ldquo;He is a tall boy&rdquo;, it is understood that &ldquo;He is not a short boy&rdquo;. The attribute Tall eliminates Short. If something is white, it eliminates black, red, blue, etc. Attributes are always of the nature of eliminating others. Other views, <em>pakshaas</em> say that multiple <em>visheshanaas</em>, attributes, cannot qualify the same object because they are all of the nature of elimination; so they have to qualify different objects is what they say, in <em>Satyam jnyaanam anantam brahma</em>; so they give a secondary meaning for all those words. But <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> says that if they are not opposed to each other, there is nothing wrong in multiple attributes qualifying the same object. This is the meaning of <em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em>. <em>Adhikarana</em> is the <em>visheshya</em>, and the <em>padaas</em> are all <em>visheshanaas</em>. Different <em>visheshanaas</em> which are not contradicting each other can qualify the same <em>visheshya. Ekasmin arthe vruttih</em>. They all qualify the same <em>artha</em>, object. Because everything is <em>shareera</em> of Vishnu, words which denote the <em>shareera</em>, can also denote the <em>shareeri. Shareera vaachaka shabda</em> also denotes the <em>shareeri</em>. This is why <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em> is possible.</p>
<p>Even for humans, when we say <em>Devadatta, Yajnyadatta</em>, it is not just the body outside which we are addressing, but also the <em>jeevaatman</em> who is inside, who is *visheshya. *<em>Jeevaatman</em> who is qualified by the body is addressed as <em>Devadatta</em>. But, it is a <em>manushya shareera</em>, so <em>Devadatta</em> as a man addresses the <em>manushya jaati</em>, but also denotes the <em>shareeri</em> who is qualified by the <em>shareera</em>. This is why <em>Devadatta</em> can be used for either the <em>chetana</em> or the body. When we say *Devadattah sama parimaanah *<em>yuvaa</em>, they are all different attributes not contradicting each other; one tells about his age, one tells about his being handsome, one tells about his colour. These are all different aspects qualifying the same object. This is how any word can be told in coordination with Vishnu because everything is His <em>shareera</em> only. This is what *Sri *<em>Paraasharar</em> is telling; first he tells about everything is His <em>shareera</em>, then he tells in coordination that everything is <em>Vishnu</em> only.

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **</p>
<p>How can we say <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em> with <em>Vishnu</em> for everything? This is because of the <em>shareera shareeri bhaava</em>. This is the most important thing we have to understand. First, <em>Paraasharar</em> made it clear that everything is <em>shareera</em> to <em>Vishnu</em>. And then, because of the <em>shareera aatma bhaava</em>, everything can be said to be in coordination with Vishnu in <em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>

All the world are <em>Vishnu</em> only, all the forests are <em>Vishnu</em> only, all the mountains and directions are <em>Vishnu</em>, stars are <em>Vishnu</em>, rivers and oceans are <em>Vishnu</em>, everything is told as <em>Vishnu</em>. All are told in coordination, how is this to be understood? This is called <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em>. By telling that water is <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vishnu</em>, that which is created is an effect of water, the <em>brahmaanda, vasundharaa, padmaakaaraa</em>, the lotus shaped <em>Brahmaanda</em>, which contains mountains, oceans, etc. is also an effect of that only, as it also is <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vishnu</em>.</p>
<p>Because waters are <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s shareera</em>, the effect of that, the modifications of water, <em>Brahmaanda</em> is also <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s shareera. Vishnu</em> is <em>aatmaa</em> for that also, this is told in all the <em>shrutis</em>, and also here. <em>Vishnu Puraana</em> is <em>upabrahmana, vishadeekarana, Shruti vaakyaas</em> are explained in detail here. <em>Taadaatmya</em> is unity, that everything is one only - *Sarvam khalvidam *<em>brahma</em>, that everything is <em>Brahman</em>. This <em>upadesha</em> is explained here in detail. The <em>taadaatmya</em> which is told in the <em>Shrutis</em>, these <em>shlokaas</em> are <em>upabrahmana</em> for that. These are the explanation for how we have to understand that. The <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em>, concomitant coordination which will be told further, is to be understood. How can that happen, means that because of *shareera aatma *<em>bhaava, saamaanaadhikaranya</em> is perfectly valid. This explains the <em>shrutis</em> which tell the <em>taadaatmya</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paraasharar</em> gives a few examples, and after that concludes with a generic statement - &rsquo; <em>yadasti yat naasti cha</em>'.</p>

<p>There is nothing other than <em>asti</em> or <em>naasti</em>, everything is either <em>chetana</em> or <em>achetana</em>. There are only three realities, <em>chit, achit</em> and <em>Eeshvara</em>. Apart from <em>Eeshvara</em>, there are only two other realities - <em>chit</em> and <em>achit</em>. He first tells about all things we see around, various luminary bodies, stars, the worlds, forests, mountains, directions, rivers, oceans. <em>Paraasharar</em> says that they are all <em>Vishnu</em> only, <em>shareera</em> of Vishnu. This is told in coordination, <em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em>.

Because of *shareera shareeri *<em>bhaava</em>, this <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em> is to be understood. Whatever is in this world, denoted by <em>asti</em> and <em>naasti; asti</em> is told as <em>asti</em> because it is eternal, does not undergo change in its essential nature. All three realities are <em>nitya</em> only. Even <em>prakruti</em> is <em>nitya</em> in its <em>avyakta avasthaa</em>. But, <em>prakruti</em> is *satata *<em>parinaami</em>, keeps on undergoing change all the time. This is why it is called as <em>naasti</em>. When we have a pot, for example, when the pot is broken, it is destroyed, it becomes <em>kapaala</em>, and when that gets broken, it becomes powder. When each <em>avasthaa</em> goes to another <em>avasthaa</em>, it is <em>naasti, naasti, naasti</em>, it attains newer and newer states. Whereas <em>chetana</em> is always <em>jnyaana eka aakaara</em>, therefore it is said to be <em>asti shabda vaachya, svaroopa parinaama</em> is not there, change happens only in <em>svabhaava</em>.</p>

What we see as <em>deva, manushya, shaila</em>, etc. are not that. Know all these things as only the expressions of the <em>jnyaana</em>, due to the karma, with the <em>anusandhaana</em> that happens.

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **Here, the <em>srushti prakarana</em> which was also told earlier, is that during <em>pralaya</em>, the entire world consisting of the sentients and non-sentients, <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em>, the entire thing is merged into <em>Bhagavaan</em>, united into <em>Bhagavaan</em> as one, as though there are no two entities. This is told in the <em>Shrutis</em>. During <em>Srushti</em>, what <em>Paramaatman</em> does is that those which are there during *pralaya *(in very subtle form, without any name and form differentiation), <em>Paramaatman</em> does <em>sankalpa</em>, and by mere willing, brings all these into their gross state, <em>sthoola avasthaa</em>, where the name and form differentiation is seen. *Sookshma chit achit vishishta *<em>Paramaatman</em> becomes <em>sthoola chit achit vishishta Paramaatman</em>. In both the causal state and state of effect, these are all <em>visheshana</em> to Him; they are all like His attributes. They are all inseparably associated with Him.</p>
<p>Why is it so? He is the supporter of everything, He is controller of everything, and He is also the Inner Self. Nothing can exist without Him. They are always associated with Him, whether in the subtle or gross state, this entire world consisting of sentients and non sentients is inseparably associated with <em>Paramaatman</em>. But, they are existing as <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman. Paramaatman&rsquo;s svaroopa</em> and <em>svabhaava</em> are told in thousands of places in the <em>Shrutis</em>, that <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s svaroopa</em> is *Satyam, *<em>Jnyaanam, Anantam</em>; that He is all pervading, omniscient, omnipotent, immutable. His <em>svabhaava</em> is such that He is storehouse of all auspicious qualities, without any blemish, it is told as *nirgunah, niranjanah, apahata paapmaa, vijarah, vimrutyuh, *<em>vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, satya kaamah, satya sankalpah</em>. He is without any defect in any state, at any time, and is storehouse of all auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em> have got certain defects. Achetana undergoes change all the time in its essential nature itself, so, it is said to be <em>naasti shabda vaachya</em>. Whatever was a lump of mud becomes a pot; when the pot is broken, we say that the pot is gone, and that it is only the pieces, <em>kapaala</em>; from that it becomes powder. So, <em>achetana</em> is all the time changing. *Achetanaa paraarthaa cha nityaa satata *<em>vikriyaa. Trigunaa karmanaamshe prakrute roopam uchyate | Prakruti</em> which is <em>achetana</em>, undergoing change all the time, in its very essential nature itself. But it is told that it is also <em>nitya</em>. How is this possible? If it is changing all the time, how can it be said to be <em>nitya</em>, eternal? That is always remaining in one particular state, of <em>moola prakruti, avyakta, pradhaana</em>. It is existing in this state all the time, <em>nitya</em>, eternal. This undergoes changes and modifies into *mahat, ahamkaara, pancha *<em>bhootaas</em> and the <em>bhoutika padaarthaas</em> we see here. All the time, it is the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. Changes happen in the <em>shareera</em>, the *svaroopa *<em>parinaama</em> of <em>prakruti</em> which is happening does not affect <em>Paramaatman</em>, as it is happening in His <em>shareera</em>, and does not affect His nature in any way.</p>
<p>In the same way, <em>jeevaatmans</em> undergo contraction and expansion in their *dharma *<em>bhoota jnyaana</em>, attributive knowledge. They are <em>avikaari</em> in <em>svaroopa</em>, the essential nature does not undergo any change any time. That is also *apahata paapma, vijarah, *Page <strong>199</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **<em>vimrutyuh, vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, satya kaamah, satya sankalpah</em>. In essential nature, he is without any defect, pure. Whereas in his attributive nature, he has contraction and expansion because of the dharma. What is this contraction and expansion; contraction means that he forgets the true reality of his nature. He forgets that he is <em>sheshabhoota</em> to <em>Paramaatman</em>, he forgets that he is pure in reality. He thinks that he is the body he has taken due to the <em>karma</em> to experience these fruits. He takes on bodies of <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc. and he thinks that he himself is <em>deva</em>. Whereas he is not. He suffers in agonies, sorrows, has happiness, etc. whereas in reality, these are all not connected to his essential nature. This is what happens to <em>jeevaatman</em>. He is always in the same way, without any change, He is eternally present like that. There is no change in his essential nature, this is why he is called as <em>nitya</em>. This is <em>asti shabda vaachya</em>. But, here also, <em>jeevaatmans</em> are having <em>Paramaatman</em> as the inner controller. They are also his <em>shareera</em>. There is change in the attributive nature of the <em>jeevaatman</em>, who is <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. This does not affect <em>Paramaatman</em> in any way.</p>
<p>In His essential and attributive nature, <em>Paramaatman</em> is untouched by any of these changes.</p>
<p>This is what is explained in these <em>shlokaas</em> as <em>asti</em> and <em>naasti</em>. What we see in this world - rivers, mountains, oceans - all of them have <em>Paramaatman</em> as the <em>aatman</em> or inner self. Words which denote the body also denote the inner self. In our case, we have a body, and there is an individual self inside. The name given the body addresses the individual self also; it is not merely the body. In the same way, the same name also addresses the <em>Paramaatman</em> who is Inner Self. So, everything can be said to be <em>Paramaatman</em> only. This is told here as *jnyaana svaroopah bhagavaan yatah. *<em>Bhagavaan</em> is <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em>.</p>
<p>*Ashesha moortih asou *- all these forms are Him only. Mountain is also <em>Bhagavaan</em> only. He is <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em>. He Himself is not the mountain; mountain is His *shareera, *<em>prakruti</em> which has modified into the form of mountain, which is <em>shareera</em> to <em>Paramaatman</em>, inseparably associated with <em>Paramaatman</em>, He being the Inner Self is always there. He can also be said to be the mountain in that way. He Himself is not the mountain, but is <em>antaryaami</em> of the mountain. Because it is inseparably associated with Him all the time, He can also be called as mountain.</p>
<p>It is only the outer expression of <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s</em> Self that all these - *shaila, abdhi, **dharaa *- the multifarious , multitude of things we see here, they are all modifications in the body of the <em>Paramaatman</em>. This is said as <em>vijnyaana vijhrumbhitaani</em>.</p>

Cf Chapter 13 of *Bhagavad *<em>Geetha. Bhagavaan</em> is only present as all the <em>kshetrajnyaas</em>. The nature of <em>Bhagavaan</em> is actually <em>jnyaana roopa</em>; though He is present in all these forms, He is present as <em>shareeri</em>, and the changes happen only in the <em>shareera. Shareeri</em> is eternal, <em>eka roopa</em>, and there is no change in <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s svaroopa, svabhaava</em>. What we see as <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc., are not the nature of <em>Bhagavaan</em>. He is only present as everything. His <em>svaabhaavika roopa</em> is <em>jnyaana</em> only, it is not <em>deva</em> and <em>manushya</em>. Because it is so, that which is seen in *achit roopa *(non sentient form) as *deva, **manushya, shaila *(mountains), *dharaa *(earth), they are all the expressions of the <em>aatman</em> due to wrong understanding, what we see outward; inside the <em>vijnyaana</em> is <em>eka roopa</em>, unchanged. The <em>chetanaas</em> also think that &lsquo;I am only <em>deva</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;I am only <em>manushya</em>&rsquo;, etc., they think that everything is Him, the *jnyaana eka *<em>aakaara</em> is <em>svaabhaavika roopa</em>, these are all just the understanding. Because of the <em>karma</em>, the <em>chetana</em> thinks that he only is <em>manushya</em>, but he is not <em>manushya</em>, he is <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em> inside; he does not understand this because of the <em>karma</em>. The <em>achit vastu</em>, non-sentient is always getting modified, undergoes change in the <em>svaroopa</em> itself, according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>kshetrajnyaas</em>, that is why it is called by the word <em>naasti</em>. The other <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em> is told as <em>asti shabda</em>. What is said as <em>asti-aatmaka</em> and <em>naasti-aatmaka - asti</em> is that which exists all the time, and <em>naasti</em> is that which is not there or destroyed - and what is the reason why they are told like that? This is told in this <em>shloka</em>.</p>
<p><em>Bhagavaan</em> is only present as all the <em>kshetrajnya. Kshetrajnyas</em> are embodied souls, <em>jeevaatman</em> having the body. <em>Kshetra</em> is the body, and <em>kshetrajnya</em> is <em>jeevaatman. Paramaatman</em> is present as Inner Self. He is only present as all. The <em>kshetra</em> is not the natural form of <em>Paramaatman</em>, as that is undergoing change all the time, and <em>Bhagavaan</em> does not undergo change like that. Because of that, these things - mountain, ocean - all are the outer expression of His <em>vijnyaana</em>, His <em>jnyaana</em> only told as His <em>sankalpa</em>. Because of His <em>sankalpa</em>, He said - <em>Bahusyaam prajaayeya</em>; and everything became gross like this. This is said to be <em>vijnyaana vijhrumbitaani</em>.</p>
<p>He did <em>sankalpa</em>, that Let Me become many; and He became many. Because of this Page <strong>201</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **reason, He is seen in all these forms. He brought this subtle state to the gross state like this. Why should He do like this? He creates all these into the gross state, He wants to give the <em>jeevaatmans</em> the experiences of the fruits of their <em>karma</em>. In order to do that, He Himself expresses in all these forms, so that <em>jeevaatmans</em> can get into all these, and can experience the results of their <em>karma</em>. And that they can also do the <em>anusthaana</em> of <em>upaaya</em>, means to emancipation, and get rid of <em>samsaara</em>. He gives them an opportunity to experience the fruits of the actions they have done, <em>karmaas</em>; and based on the <em>karmaas</em> of each individual, different experiences are there; those experiences happen in various kinds of bodies, and all these bodies are created because of that. This is told as <em>kalpita, kalpanaa</em> means <em>srushti</em>; this is also told in one <em>Brahma Sutra, Kalpanopadeshaat cha. Kalpanaa</em> is *sooryaa chandramasou dhaataa *<em>yathaa poorvam akalpayat. Kalpanam srushtih</em> is explained by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em>.</p>
<p>Generally, when we translate the word <em>kalpita</em>, we say &ldquo;imagined&rdquo;. He did <em>sankalpa</em>; they are all true. Nothing is false in our <em>siddhaanta</em>; everything is true; it is not an illusion. Why is it true? It is to give a place for experience of the <em>karmaas</em>, fruits of the <em>karmaas</em>, for the <em>jeevaatman. Paramaatman</em> Himself has to support everything, He is supporting all the time; He brings about this change in the <em>shareera</em>, and then He makes <em>jeevaatmans</em> get into the various bodies, makes them experience the results of the karma, creation is done because of that. But, by His nature, He Himself is not the mountain, He is unaffected by any of the defects of the *shareera, *<em>chetana</em> or <em>achetana</em>. He remains in the same form all the time.</p>
<p>The <em>achit vastu</em>, which is non-sentient, is getting modified according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>kshetrajnya</em>. So, it is told as the <em>naasti shabda</em>. It does not remain the same all the time, keeps on changing. When a person dies, that person is gone, he is <em>naasti</em>. Whereas he enters another body. The body merges into the five elements, <em>pancha bhootaas</em>. And a new body is created, and is given to the <em>jeevaatman. Achetana</em> is all the time undergoing change, and does not remain in the same state always. Because of this, it is said to be <em>naasti shabda vaachya</em>.</p>
<p><em>Jeevaatmans</em> are called by <em>asti shabda</em>, because the same <em>jeevaatman</em> enters into another body. There is only contraction in his <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, but he remains constant without any change.</p>

That is why he is addressed at many places as <em>jnyaana</em> itself, because it is the <em>saara bhoota guna</em> of <em>jeevaatman</em>. His *nija *<em>roopa</em> is that only, but because of karma, it is covered because of the <em>avidyaa</em>. When he gets rid of that, which is the cause of the <em>anusandhaana</em> that &lsquo;I am different&rsquo;, when all the defects are completely gone, he becomes pure and his original state, the various objects of experience which are here, that will not be there anymore with the karma completely gone. In order to experience the karma only, all these are there, we think that &lsquo;We are eating food&rsquo;, in the real state, all these things are not there, when he attains his real state without any <em>karma</em>. Because of the <em>karma</em>, he thinks of himself as <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc., he thinks of them to be enjoyable, this is addressed by the word <em>naasti. Chetana</em> is in its original state, which is *jnyaanaika roopa, *<em>shuddha</em>, denoted by the <em>asti shabda</em>.</p>
<p>We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 12, where <em>Paraasharar</em> is teaching very important aspects. After having taught about the <em>bhuvanaas</em>, the various worlds, <em>Paraasharar</em> is teaching a very important concept that everything is controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>, *Sri *<em>Mahaavishnu</em>, and that He is <em>antaryaami</em> of everything. He is existing as everything. All these aspects, <em>Paraasharar</em> is teaching here.</p>
<p><em>Jeevaatman</em> is also <em>jnyaana eka aakaara. Jeevaatman</em> who is also *jnyaana eka *<em>aakaara</em>, being pure and untainted even in the bound state in his essential nature, but his attributive nature only changes. When he is in a body of a <em>deva</em>, he identifies himself with the <em>deva</em>, he thinks he himself is the body. But, he is not <em>deva</em>, he is actually a <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em>. He forgets this because of the contraction in attributive Page <strong>203</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **knowledge. He identifies himself with all these <em>achetana padaarthaas</em>. Whereas he is <em>chetana, jnyaana avaroopi</em>, he forgets that. This happens because of the <em>karma</em> that he has accumulated. He has to experience the results of that <em>karma</em>. When he surrenders unto the Lord, does <em>bhakti yoga</em>, gets rid of that <em>karma</em>, all these defects vanish. At that time, he is without any defect, and goes into his natural state, *nija *<em>roopi</em>. Identifying himself with the <em>deva</em> and other forms, he thinks of himself in those forms - these forms are a result of the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>jeevaatmans</em>, and also the enjoyable things which are there - the sense objects, <em>bhoga arthaah</em>. When his <em>karmaas</em> all end, then he will not experience these forms and sense objects any more, he will never think of himself as <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc. All these things we see in this world, as most enjoyable, it will not be like that, because he will be in his true original state where his <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> will be in proper original state. He will never be subjected to these limited experiences which happen here. When he was in a body like <em>deva</em> and others, when he thought of himself as the body, the objects of experience and enjoyment, which are nothing but *deva, manushya, shaila, *<em>abdhi, dharaa</em>, the various objects we see here, when the <em>karmaas</em> are destroyed, these kinds of experiences will not be there any more. The <em>achit vastu</em>, which is insentient, matter, is always taking some state or the other, undergoing change, is called by the <em>naasti shabda.

Leaving out the <em>jnyaana svaroopa aatma</em>, any <em>achetana</em>, material we see around here, at any point of time, and for whatever reason cannot be called by the <em>asti shabda</em>. Though he is of a nature very different from <em>deva</em> and others, the cause of taking on a body like <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc., are the various <em>karmaas</em> done himself; and the identifying with the body of <em>deva</em> and others, also happens due to the <em>karma</em> only. Always he is associated and going with those forms only, it is not because of the <em>aatma</em>, but because of the <em>achetana</em> which is <em>naasti shabda vaachya</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paraasharar</em> is telling that no <em>achetana</em>, for whatever reason, cannot be called as *asti *<em>shabda. Jeevaatman</em> only is the thing which can be called as <em>asti shabda</em>. Even though <em>jeevaatman</em> is taking the form and identifying himself, it is due to the association with <em>prakruti</em> and not because of nature of <em>aatman</em>. It is not because of the nature of <em>aatman</em> because it is unchanging all the time, and all the time *jnyaana *<em>eka aakaara</em>.</p>

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **Whereas <em>jeevaatman</em> remains in the same state, constant in his essential nature. <em>Achit amsha</em> is changing every moment, is called <em>naasti shabda</em>. This kind of world having <em>chetanaas</em> and <em>achetanaas</em>, is the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vaasudeva</em>, supported by Him, controlled by Him, and He is master of all. Always it is having <em>Vaasudeva</em> as the self. That is the reality of this world, which I have explained you in detail. I have explained you in detail, very clearly, that this is the <em>yaathaatmya</em> of the <em>jagat</em>, reality, real nature of this world, which has <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em>, everything having <em>Vaasudeva</em> as the <em>aatman</em>. Everything is the <em>shareera</em> for <em>Vaasudeva</em>.</p>
<p><em>Yat asti, yat naasti</em>, whatever was told in the beginning, is being concluded here with the words <em>satya</em> and <em>asatya. Asatya</em> does not mean it is false or illusion, but that it is <em>naasti shabda vaachya</em>. Because the <em>upadesha</em> here is started with the world being <em>Vaasudevaatmaka</em>, by telling as <em>asti, naasti</em>. Whatever is started in the <em>upakrama</em>, beginning, is concluded here in the <em>upasamhaara</em> with the words <em>satya</em> and <em>asatya</em>. The <em>aatma-aatma saamya</em>, which is told in <em>Geetha</em> also, that all the <em>aatmans</em> are similar because all are <em>jnyaana eka aakaara</em>. Every <em>aatma</em> in every body is <em>jnyaana eka aakaara</em>. They are multiple individuals but are all *jnyaana eka *<em>aakaaraas</em>. There is no identity, but it is similarity. There are innumerable number of <em>jeevaatmans</em>, but all are <em>jnyaanaikaakaaraas. Ashabda</em> is <em>prakruti</em>, which is <em>achetana</em>, as told in the <em>Brahma Sutras</em>. The entire thing present in this world is mixture of <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em>. In the <em>vyavahaara</em>, when we do our daily activities, as <em>deva, manushya - karma</em> only is the cause for all this.</p>

If one starts associating with these, and identifying with these only, he will keep on coming into the cycle of births and deaths only. Having known all these, one should put effort to escape from <em>samsaara</em>. This is the purpose of all of this. One has to put effort to liberate from this <em>samsaara</em>. Knowing that the fruits of <em>karma</em> are all <em>asthira</em>, impermanent. <em>Vaasudeva</em> who is *sadaa achala, sadaa ekaroopa, dhruva *- whatever is to be performed in order to attain, gain communion with <em>Vaasudeva</em>, then he will attain that. He will go and attain <em>Paramaatman. Upaasanaa, prapatti</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Having told about the 14 worlds, in such great detail, having told that everything is <em>Vaasudevaatmaka</em>, having told the <em>chetana amsha</em> is only <em>nitya</em> here, the *asti *<em>shabda vaachya</em>, that the essential nature of <em>aatman</em> is untainted, that <em>achetana</em> is all the time undergoing changes, that they are all created by <em>Paramaatman</em> in order to experience the fruits of the <em>karma</em> that the <em>chetanaas</em> have done, that the <em>chetanaas</em> get into that and identify themselves, that even those not having a proper knowledge see that <em>achetana</em> is all the time changing, realizing that Page <strong>209</strong> of **297<br>
