Now, what is the connection, transition to the story of <em>Bharata</em>, coming here? This is explained in the Commentary. In the last <em>shloka</em> of the previous chapter, it was told that &ldquo;Having known that this <em>jeevaatman</em> takes on different forms and it is not in his real nature like that; because of <em>karma</em>, he becomes <em>deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi</em>, he is suffering here, thinking that he only is all that; but in reality, he is not so; knowing that, and understanding that, one has to put effort by adopting which means, he will get rid of this <em>karma</em>, and he will attain <em>Vaasudeva</em>. One has to do whatever is required to get rid of this <em>samsaara</em>&rdquo;, this was told in the end. The means to attain <em>Vaasudeva</em> was told there. It was told that one has to do that, the means; one has to do the <em>upaaya anusthaana</em>. That is not easy, <em>bhagavat upaasanaa</em> is difficult, and is full of obstructions, so many obstructions to attaining <em>Vaasudeva</em>. To attain that <em>jnyaana yoga</em>, the obstructions which are there in the path of attaining <em>Vaasudeva</em>, and the way one can get rid of those obstructions - the story of <em>Bharata</em>, whichever was mentioned earlier, is a good example for that. In order to listen to that in detail, <em>Maitreyar</em> is asking <em>Sri Paraasharar</em>.</p>

It is said that one who has perfected the yoga, the <em>karmaas</em> done earlier will lead him to attain perfection in the yoga. He had attained perfection in the <em>yoga</em>, he had perceived the self directly; <em>aparoksha jnyaana</em> is <em>pratyaksha jnyaana</em> of the <em>aatman</em>. Because of that, he was a realized soul, and was always established in the self, in the <em>aatma jnyaana</em>; for such a person who is a <em>yogaaroodha</em>, it is alright if he does not do <em>yajnya</em> and other such <em>karmaas</em>. By this it does not mean that one who has simply known the <em>vaakyaartha jnyaana</em>, who just has studied the <em>Vedaas</em> and knows the meanings of the <em>mantraas</em> without having the <em>aatma jnyaana</em> and having not realized the meanings - such a person is not supposed to leave the <em>karma</em>. Because, in order to attain perfection in <em>yoga</em>, one has to get <em>jnyaana</em> and *karma *- both are required. *Karma *<em>anushtaana</em> is also required for <em>shuddhi</em> of the mind.

<p>Then the <em>Souveera Raaja&rsquo;s</em> story is going to come, where King <em>Souveera</em> is going towards <em>Kapila Aashrama</em>, to obtain instructions on the <em>aatma jnyaana</em>. How he meets <em>Bharata</em>, the <em>yogi</em>, is going to come next.</p>
<p>We saw the story of the <em>antaraaya</em> with the <em>mruga</em>, how he had to be born as a deer, how he expended all that <em>karma</em> responsible for that <em>janma</em>, and again was born in a <em>yogi&rsquo;s kula</em>, and is again established in <em>aatma jnyaana</em>.</p>
<p>We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 13, the <em>Jadabharata upaakhyaana</em>; about how <em>Jadabharata</em>, was born in a great <em>yogi&rsquo;s</em> family, as a <em>brahmin</em>, had *poorva janma *<em>smaranaa</em>, and was endowed with complete knowledge, a person who had perfected the yoga already, and knew that because of the <em>praarabdha karma</em>, he had to continue and do all the things that are coming. As a <em>yogi</em>, he was so much involved in his <em>yoga</em>, following the <em>Hiranyagarbha vachana</em>. He used to fear any honour, because that will bring some kind of ego, and will disturb the yoga. When a <em>yogi</em> is dishonoured and disrespected by people, then this <em>yogi</em> attains perfection soon. He used to live as though he was <em>jada</em>, <em>unmatta</em>, etc. as if he is a dullard, not knowing anything, and absolutely useless kind of feeling. He used to wear all dirty clothes, and was never bothered about any of these things. Whatever little people used to give, leftovers, he used to think that itself as a lot, and used to be very happy, contented with whatever he used to get to carry his body. He used to be happy with whatever was given, even old and spoilt stuff.</p>
<p>He was fat and well built. Looking at him, people all around used him for all kinds of work.</p>

Dehaanaam sanghaatatvaat pratyekam anekatvam |</strong></em> It was said that it is because of <em>prakruti, gunaas, karmaas</em> which are accumulated due to <em>avidyaa</em>. So, the <em>aatman</em> does not have all these. By these, we can know that <em>aatman</em> cannot be seen, that he is not carrying, etc. He also does not have the characteristics of being fat, etc. <em>Aatman</em> is untouched by the blood and all things, impurities in the body. He is indestructible. He is free from *ashanaaya, pipaasa, **jaraa, mrutyu, dukha, sukha *- these are the *oormi shatka *- hunger, thirst (characteristics of the <em>praana</em>), old age, death (characteristics of the <em>deha</em>), happiness and sorrow (characteristics of the mind); this <em>oormi shatka</em> is not there for the <em>aatman</em>. The <em>prakruti gunaas sattva, rajas, tamas</em> are not there for the <em>aatman</em>. He is different and distinct from <em>prakruti</em>. He does not have the <em>dharmaas</em> of <em>prakruti</em>. Therefore, either growth or deterioration are not there for the <em>aatman</em>. Body grows and shrinks in old age - these are all not there for <em>aatman</em>. One more reason is that he is <em>eka</em>; the meaning is not that there is only one <em>aatman</em> in all of us, but that he is not a collectivity, he is niravayavi. Body is collectivity of five elements, which has <em>indriyaas</em>, which are <em>ahamkaarika</em>, but all are <em>prakruti parinaama</em> only. Body is <em>sanghaata</em>, collectivity. Whereas <em>aatman</em> is <em>eka, niravayavi</em>. Because it is a collectivity, <em>deha</em> and other things grow and shrink. That which is not a collectivity, like the sky, or <em>paramaanu</em>, it does not have growth and shrinkage. Just as you and I are not the body, all the embodied souls are like that, the <em>aatman</em> which is present in all the embodied souls, is similar to the <em>aatman</em> who is in you and in me. Whatever I said, you can see in all the beings. He is <em>jnyaana svaroopa</em> in all the bodies. In all beings, <em>aatma amsha</em> is only one, is also another meaning of <em>ekasya akhila jantushu</em>; there is one <em>aatman</em> in every being. Because <em>deha</em> is <em>sanghaata</em>, collectivity, there is multiplicity like that. Each body is multiple, because five elements are there, whereas <em>aatman</em> is one only in every body.</p>

<p>We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 13, where <em>Mahaayogi Bharata</em>, who is not revealing his nature that he is a great <em>yogi</em>, is showing himself as a dullard, or useless person, is made to carry the palanquin of the king <em>Souveera</em>. And as he is going in an uneven way, the king asks the carriers to carry them properly, then <em>Jadabharata</em> starts to give strange answers, when everyone points at him. The king asks him - You are so stout, well built, why re you not carrying properly, are you tired. He starts to give strange answers and the king does not expect such answers from someone who looks like a labourer, who has been brought to carry his palanquin. He tells that the king does not have <em>aatma jnyaana</em>, that the self is different and distinct from the body; the king starts to still argue with him that he is fat; <em>Bharata</em> explains to him that these are all <em>prakruti</em> only, the <em>aatman</em> is different and distinct from the body, and that the <em>aatman</em> is not carrying anything. He says that if I have to carry this weight, if I am carrying this weight, I should carry the weight of the <em>pruthvi</em> also, all the mountains, and everyone should be doing that including you. Whatever is the material from which your palanquin is made, from the same material the body is also made, and keeps quiet. Immediately, the king recognizes that he is no ordinary person, that he is a great yogi, then jumps from his palanquin and holds his feet firmly, and requests him to tell him who he is, and teach him that <em>aatma jnyaana</em>. Then <em>Bharata</em> starts to teach.</p>

| ***In the same way, the body which is made up of head, <em>paayu, paani</em>, etc., is a collection of all these, and is the support of tongue and others. That body is also not the individual self. When one is awake, we say that &ldquo;This is my body&rdquo;, I am different from the body, as clearly experienced. In the dream state and deep sleep state, even though <em>aatman</em> is present and is self-vivid, <em>svayam prakaasha</em>, and <em>deha</em> is different, the body is experienced as differently, or it is not experienced at all. In dream state, we experience different things, and in deep sleep, nothing is experienced, but the <em>aatman</em> is still there. This also shows that body is different from *aatman. *<em>Shruti</em> says &quot; <em>Svarga kaamo yajeta</em>&quot;, meaning that one who wants to go and experience in <em>svarga</em>, he has to perform this <em>yaaga</em>. If <em>aatman</em> is not different from the body, the body is destroyed when one dies, and svarga and other fruits are experienced after death only, in some other birth. If the <em>aatman</em> is not different from the body, then all these things will become meaningless. It is very clear in the <em>shrutis</em> that <em>aatman</em> is different and distinct from the body. Or, the body made of head, hands, etc., has got many parts, <em>avayavaas, aham artha</em> is only one. It can also be explained in this way. <em>Deha, indriya</em>, are all not the <em>aatman</em>, with which part shall I say &quot; <em>aham</em>&quot;, &ldquo;this is I&rdquo;. That is why I am not able to say.</p>

This is told by these two <em>shlokaas</em>. According to our <em>siddhaanta, aatma-bahutva</em> is accepted, that every body has a different <em>aatman</em>. Every body has an <em>aatman</em>, but all are of the same nature - all are <em>jnyaana-eka-aakaaraa</em>, and all are <em>prakaara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. In this way, all are similar, equal, and it is not identity. The individual selves are many, there is not one individual self. Why we can understand like this? If there is one who is different from me, it is accepted that there is one in another body also. If the <em>aatman</em> in another body is different from me, then only we can say that &ldquo;He is he&rdquo;, and &ldquo;I am I&rdquo;. We know that, and it is accepted that there is an <em>aatman</em> in another body also, but he is not different from me, in the sense that we are of the same nature. <em>Vyakti aikya</em> is not told. Accepting that there is another <em>aatman</em> who is other than me, he is not different; the meaning is that he is of the same nature. If it had been only one <em>aatman</em>, words like <em>anyah, parah</em> would not have been used here. I cannot say that &ldquo;He is <em>anya</em>&rdquo;, because the other person is also *jnyaana-eka-*<em>aakaara</em> only. That he is different is negated here. ***<br>

prajaah, iti cha darshanaat |</strong></em> This is the gist of these two <em>shlokaas</em> here. If any other <em>aatman</em> would have been different from me, who is of a different nature than <em>jnyaana-eka-aakaara</em> of mine, pure consciousness, in that case, I would have told that I am <em>jnyaana-eka-aakaara</em>, and he is of a different nature. It is not true like this. This is the *aatma-aatma-*<em>samatva</em> which is told in <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> also, that all are <em>jnyaana eka aakaaraas</em>, they are all equal. The difference which we see in <em>jaati, kula</em>, etc, is not the <em>dharma</em> of the *aatman *- these are not the attributes of the individual self, who is only of the nature of consciousness. All are <em>prakaara</em>, modes of <em>Paramaatman</em>, so that we can say that all are equal, one. All are <em>prakaara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. For everyone, <em>Paramaatman</em> only is the inner self. He is the <em>prakaari, antaryaami</em>. There is only one <em>Prakaari</em>, but all are modes of <em>Paramaatman</em>. All are <em>prakaara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, so all are one. All are <em>prakaara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, can be told in the primary meaning itself. There is a <em>prayoga</em> called *samaana-dharma *<em>asamaana-dharma aneka-dharma</em>; that they are all of the same attributes, they are of different attributes, and same attributes and many attributes; all are of the same attributes, all are of different attributes, in this kind of meaning, if it is to be conveyed, all are of same attributes, all are of many attributes, is also used. *Eko *<em>vreehih</em> is a common usage. When we see a heap of rice, we say In all houses, it is the same rice which is used. Means that <em>vyakti aikya</em> is not there. Rice is same means that they also eat rice and we also eat rice, but it is not the same rice eaten at both places.</p>

So, oneness can be told of all the <em>aatmans</em>. In the first <em>shloka</em> above ( <em>Shloka</em> 90), <em>aatmans</em> are different in each body, but they are all of the same nature, they are not of different nature. So, the fact of the <em>aatmans</em> being of different nature is negated here, but not the multiplicity of <em>aatmans</em>.</p>

If you accept that there is only one <em>aatman</em>, it will be totally against this <em>shruti</em>. It is also said &quot; *Aham tvam cha tathaa *<em>anye cha</em>&quot; ( <em>Shloka</em> 69 above) - so it is not one <em>aatman</em>, but it is one <em>aatman</em> in each body, of the same nature and they are all being the <em>prakaara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, all <em>jnyaana-eka-aakaara</em>. And also of the same nature, the <em>Bhagavad Gita shloka</em> is told. The <em>aatmans</em>, individual selves, the <em>vaishamya</em> is not there, they are of the same nature.

In the state of <em>avyakta</em>, the <em>moola prakruti</em>, it is also eternal. But, it undergoes changes, that is why it is called as <em>asat</em>, or <em>avastu</em>, because it does not remain in the same state all the time.</p>
<p>We are at the end of <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 13, where <em>Bharata</em> is teaching the *aatma <em><em>svaroopa</em>, to King <em>Souveera</em>, that the <em>aatma svaroopa</em> is different from <em>deha, <em><em>indriyaas</em>, and we need to study the last few <em>shlokaas</em>.</em></em></em> ***With respect to the <em>achit, achetana</em>, what is meant is <em>avastu</em> and <em>asat; tuccha</em> means Page <strong>245</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **it gets destroyed, it does not exist; <em>mitthya</em> means that it is imagined, it is only appearance; it is not like this, because though there is change in the essential nature, there is no complete destruction.</p>
<p>In one of the earlier <em>shlokaas</em>, it was told that whatever is mud, it became pot; that mud is destroyed and pot is created. Then pot is destroyed and <em>kapaala</em> is created. Then <em>kapaala</em> is destroyed and <em>choorna</em>, powder is created. Then the powder is destroyed, and it becomes dust. Then, it is destroyed and it becomes <em>anu</em>, which is not seen. But, in all these, the <em>svaroopa naasha</em> is not there. It is only there in some other state. The previous state gets destroyed, and the next state is created, <em>avasthaantaraapatti</em>. There is no complete destruction of the <em>svaroopa</em>.</p>
<p>So <em>avastu</em> or <em>asat</em> does not mean <em>tucchatva</em> or <em>mitthyaatva</em>.</p>
<p>The *avastu *- state gets destroyed, and it gets into new state. Due to a different time, because of the <em>parinaama</em> or <em>upaadhi</em>, like <em>karma</em>, different form comes. That which does not get that, what is that - it is not whatever you are seeing here. How can we know that it is not <em>tucchatva</em> or <em>mitthyaatva</em>; the word <em>kaalaantarena</em> indicates that as time passes, whatever does not change is told with respect to the <em>vastu</em>, which is <em>aatman</em>. This means that the <em>avastu</em> changes over time. This indicates that it is not <em>mithyaa</em>.</p>
<p>If it is in the same place, and same time, then <em>vidhi</em> and <em>nishedha</em> both cannot happen. So, it can happen at different times, and different places, it is possible. <em>Desha, kaala aikya</em> is not there. What was mud in the morning, it becomes pot in the afternoon. Mud is destroyed and pot is there. So, destruction and creation, does not happen at the same time and place, but there is time difference, there could be place difference, etc. If there is <em>desha kaala aikya</em>, then <em>virodha</em> can happen, but it is not so here. ***</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 13, Shloka 102: <br>
Tvam kim etat shirah kim nu greevaa tava tathaa udaram |<br>
Kimu paada aadikam tvam vai tava etat kim maheepate ||</strong></em> Are you your head, or are you your neck. Or are you your stomach, what are you? Or are you your feet? Are you all of these, or do they belong to you? Shall I say you are the head, or shall I say that it is your head?</p>
<p>***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Atha * Pindah pruthak ityaadinaa sankshepena uktam artham upapaadayan deha<br>
aatma vivekam prakarana artham upasamharati - tvam kim etat iti |<br>
Andhatamasi akshi nimeelane cha niravayavatvena aatmanah pratyaktayaa<br>
aham iti bhaasamaanatvaat, idam buddhi bodhyam adrushya aparabhaagam cha<br>
shira aadi naatmaa, na cha aatmano avayavah | ***What was told earlier that you are different from the body, and <em>indriyaas</em>, etc., it is explained again, and the <em>prakarana</em> is concluded with these <em>shlokaas</em> now. The gist of this <em>prakarana</em> is <em>deha aatma viveka</em>, differences and specific distinctions between body and <em>aatman</em>, is being concluded here. In darkness, and when someone is closing their eyes, as <em>aatman</em> is <em>niravayavi</em>; meaning that when we close the eyes, <em>aatma&rsquo;s</em> eyes are not closed, as <em>aatman</em> does not have eyes, hands, etc.; so it is <em>niravayavi. Pratyaktva</em> is <em>svasmai bhaasamaanatvam</em>; it always reveals itself as <em>aham aham</em>.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful portion in <em>Bruhadaaranyaka Upanishad</em> called <em>Jyoti Braahmana</em>. There, these things are explained in detail. It is asked - how is the <em>aatman</em> known when the <em>Aaditya</em>, Sun is not there? It is answered that - is it <em>Chandramaa</em>, is it <em>Agni</em>? Finally when it is complete darkness, what is it that gives light to the <em>Purusha</em>? This is called as <em>Jyotirbraahmana</em>. First, it says <em>Aaditya; Aaditya</em> is the one which gives light to the <em>jeevaatman</em>. When Sun is not there, there is the Moon. When the Moon is also not there, how does the <em>jeevaatman</em> know; it is through Agni. When Agni is not there, extinguished, what is the light. Finally it comes to when it is full darkness, it is <em>vaak</em>, speech. When there is complete darkness, we can know by speaking. When <em>vaak</em> is also not there, it is <em>svayam jyotih, aatma jyoti</em>. He knows himself, does not need any external light, or anything else. This is <em>svasmai bhaasamaanatva</em>. He is always known as <em>aham. Aatman</em> is <em>aham</em>, everything else is <em>idam</em>. When we point to some object, we say <em>idam</em>. When we say ourselves, we say <em>aham</em>. This is different from I. Whatever other parts of the body are there, head and others, they are not <em>aatman</em>; they are told as <em>idam</em>. They are also not parts of the <em>aatman. Aatman</em> is a <em>niravayavi</em>.</p>

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **<em><strong>Samasta avayavebhyah tvam pruthak bhoopa vyavasthitah |<br>
Ko aham iti atra nipuno bhootvaa chintaya paarthiva ||</strong></em> From all these parts in the body, eyes, ears, hands, legs, etc., you are existing separately from all of them, O King. You have to intelligently think &ldquo;Who am I&rdquo;.</p>
<p>***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Samasta avayavebhya iti | Tasmaat ebhah pruthak aatmaa vyavasthita iti<br>
arthah | Nipuno bhootvaa iti paathah | Yathaa uktam yaamunaachaaryaih *<br>
Aham buddhya paraagarthaat pratyak artho hi bhidyate * iti | ***Because of this, the <em>aatma</em> is existing separately from all these things, different and distinct. <em>Yaamunaachaarya&rsquo;s sookti</em> is referred here by *Sri Engal Aalwaan *- the <em>Pratyagaatma</em> is revealed to himself, *svasmai bhaasamaanah, paraak *<em>artha</em> is <em>parasmai bhaasamaana</em>. From that which is only revealed to others, but does not know itself, the <em>aatman</em> who knows itself is different, by <em>aham buddhi</em>, known as <em>aham aham</em>. Whereas things which are revealed to others are known as <em>idam</em>, they don&rsquo;t know themselves. This is the difference.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 13, Shloka 104: <br>

<p>***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Prakrutam prashna prativachana vaiyarthyam upasamharati evam iti | Tattve<br>

atmaantarebhyah pruthak karana nishpaadyam vachanam bhaashitum na<br>
shakyam, sarva saadhaarana aakaarah aham iti vaktum na shakyata iti arthah | ***The question and answer which they exchanged initially was not proper because this is how reality is. This is concluded here. The reality, nature of the <em>aatman</em> is like this. We can separate hands and feet, or also as *deva, manushya *- we see this kind of separation and differences. This is the <em>bheda</em>. These are all characteristics of the body, and not the <em>aatman</em>; they are all <em>anaatma dharmaas</em>. From other <em>aatmans</em> also, whatever can be separated - I cannot say that I am that. I cannot say that I am like all others, because one is <em>deva</em>, one is <em>manushya</em>, one is someone else, etc. Whatever forms we are seeing outside, with all the parts of the body, the <em>jaati</em>, etc. we cannot say that I am all that.</p>
