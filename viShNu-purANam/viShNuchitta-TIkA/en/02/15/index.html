And again, he told <em>Bharata</em>. There is a story which is also teaching a similar thing, where <em>aatma svaroopa</em> is being taught. That story he started to recite.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>

When he was still thinking, still not very clear; that the body appearance is one thing - the <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc., but how about hunger, thirst, etc. he started to think about them. Is hunger, thirst real, not real, is it in <em>aatma svaroopa</em>, or not, is it due to karma, etc., he started to think. The difference can still exist because things like thirst, hunger, are different for different people. It is something other than the form of the body which is seen. The king was silent thinking about this. The <em>Braahmana</em> knew what the king was thinking. He then started to tell him a story about this, to clear those doubts. That there is no difference in the <em>chit vastu</em>, all are <em>jnyaana eka aakaaraas</em> only. With respect to this, he started to tell one more story. In which thirst, hunger are all addressed.</p>

Kva iti | Kva nivaasa iti bahuvreehih | Yatra saayamgruha itivat |</strong></em> <em>Kva nivaasah</em> is addressed to *Rubhu *- which is your place of living. Travellers travelling from place to place taking a long journey, at the end of the day, they go and stay in some place. They start their journey the next day, and again at the end of the day, they stay in some place. This is called <em>Saayamgruhaa gatih</em>. Are you passing through this place like that?</p>
<p>Further <em>Rubhu</em> starts to teach the <em>aatma svaroopa</em>. These are similar to what <em>Souveera Mahaaraaja</em> asks <em>Bharata</em>.* *</p>
<p>We are at the end of <em>Amsha</em> 2, Chapter 15, where the story of <em>Sri Bharata</em>, the great yogi is reciting the story of <em>Rubhu</em> and <em>Nidaagha</em>, to <em>Souveera Mahaaraaja</em>. <em>Rubhu</em> comes to teach the <em>paramaartha</em> to his <em>shishya Nidaagha</em>, who, he thought had not really attained that true knowledge. And seeing a <em>Brahmin</em> come to his house, after finishing <em>Vaishvedeva, Nidaagha</em> invites him and offers him food. <em>Rubhu</em> says that he wants really good savouries, <em>mrushtaanna</em>, and do not want ordinary food, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want <em>amrushtaanna</em>&rdquo;. As per his wish, <em>Nidaagha&rsquo;s</em> wife prepares all the good food, and they serve him. After that, <em>Nidaagha</em> asks his *atithi Rubhu *-</p>

They are told to be qualities of the body, because the <em>dhaatus</em> which are there in the body, when that gets reduced, or is absent, then this happens. So, this is only <em>upachaara</em>, just told like that. It is because of the <em>dhaatus</em> in the <em>deha</em> that this happens, though it is a quality of the mind. It is an <em>icchaa</em> of the mind. *Icchaa, *<em>dvesha</em> happen to the mind. The <em>Shruti</em> says that hunger and thirst are for <em>praana</em>, and grief and <em>moha</em> belong to the mind. The <em>shruti vaakya</em> says that hunger and thirst are not for <em>deha</em>, but for <em>praana. Jaraa</em> and <em>mrutyu</em> are <em>deha dharmaas</em>. So, this is basically a <em>kriyaa shakti</em> of manas only, the <em>antahkarana</em> only. <em>Trupti</em> is <em>upalakshana</em> to <em>tushti</em>.</p>

<p>Here, he teaches how <em>aatman</em> is different from the body, and how these don&rsquo;t belong to the <em>aatman</em>. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 15, Shloka 24: <br>

<p><em>Sarvagata</em> and <em>vyaapee</em> is told for <em>jeevaatman</em>. How can it be told for <em>jeevaatman</em> who is <em>anu</em>? This needs explanation. ***<br>
Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Pumaan iti | Na atra pumso gaganavat parama mahatvena gamana aadi<br>
nishidhyate, tathaa sati sarvagata vyaapi padayoh pounarukhtyaat |*** <em>Aakaasha</em> is said to be <em>parama mahat</em>, is present everywhere. Because of that, it does not have <em>gamana</em>, movement. Just like <em>aakaasha, aatman</em> is not meant to be told here as <em>parama mahat</em>. That is why <em>gamana</em> is not there - this is not the reason. If that had been the case, <em>sarvagata</em> and <em>vyaapee</em> would not be proper - it would have been <em>punarukti</em>, which is not generally done when <em>svaroopa lakshana</em> is told.</p>
<p><em>Paramaanu</em> is the most minute thing, and <em>parama mahat</em> is the biggest thing. <em>Aakaasha</em> is <em>parama mahat</em>. Page <strong>272</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **</p>
<p><em>Gamana, aagamana</em> is not there, not because <em>jeevaatman</em> is *parama *<em>mahat</em> like <em>aakaasha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Poorvatra gamana anumatyaa parimitatva abhyupagamaat, sootra virodhaat<br>
cha na para mahatvam aatmanah |</strong></em> Earlier, <em>gamama</em> was told, and it is also accepted that he is any <em>svaroopa</em>, very subtle. In <em>Sutra</em> also, it is told that &quot; <em>Naanuh atat shruteh iti</em>&quot;. <em>Poorva paksha</em> says that <em>aatman</em> is not <em>anu. Shruti</em> says &quot; <em>Na cha aananytyaaya kalpate</em>&quot;. When the <em>jeevaatman svaroopa</em> is being told, <em>sootra virodha</em> will happen if that had been the case.</p>
<p><em>Shruti</em> tells clearly about <em>jeevaatman</em> that <em>gamana, aagamana</em>, are very clearly told. And <em>aatman&rsquo;s</em> characteristics are told in the Second <em>Adhyaaya</em>, <em>Third Paada</em>. It is clearly established that <em>aatman</em> is <em>anu svaroopa</em>.</p>
<p>It is also told *Vaalaagra shata bhaagasya shatadhaa kalpitasya cha | **Bhaago jeevasya vijnyeyah &hellip; *The same <em>Shruti</em> also says &quot; <em>Sa cha aanantyaaya kalpate</em>&quot;. <em>Aanantya</em> is through his <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, and not in <em>svaroopa</em>.</p>
<p>So, there will be <em>virodha</em> with <em>Shruti</em> and <em>Sootra</em> if that is accepted - that it is *parama *<em>mahat</em>. So, we have to understand that though it is said as <em>aakaashavat</em>, it is not because he is <em>parama mahat</em>. Other sutraas said - <em>Upaadaanaat vihaaropadeshaat cha</em>, he moves around in the body. When he leaves this body also, he goes in *Archiraadi *<em>maarga</em>, and reaches *Paramaatman <em>- all these are clearly told in the <em>Sutras</em>. So <em>Sutra <em><em>virodha</em> will also happen if it is told that <em>aatman</em> is <em>parama mahat</em>. So, that is not the meaning here. ***<br>
Ayam arthah - sarvagatah - sarvatra deva aadi dehe avasthitah ayam aatmaa,<br>
vyaapee niravayavatvena ati sookshmatvaat sarva achetana vyaapana sheelah |</em></em></em> This is the correct meaning. That he can enter into any body, anywhere in the <em>Prakruti mandala</em>. There are innumerable, <em>ananta koti jeevaas</em> in the *Prakruti *<em>mandala</em>. They are all in different bodies. So he can be anywhere in any body. This is the meaning of sarvagata. He is present in deva, manushya, krimi, keeta. <em>Vyaapee</em> means that is <em>niravayavi</em>, part-less, he is extremely subtle in proportion. He can pervade all the <em>achetanaas</em>, however <em>sookshma</em> the <em>achetana</em> is.</p>
<p><em><strong>Atah asya niravayavasya amoortasya cha aakaashaadivat ati soukshmymatvaat<br>
svato gamana aagamane na bhavatah |</strong></em> <em>Amoorta</em> means that he cannot be perceived by our <em>maamsa chakshus</em>. And he is part-less. <em>Aakaasha</em> is also very subtle. By himself, he cannot move and come. Means that Page <strong>273</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **he always needs a <em>shareera</em> for movement.</p>
<p><em><strong>Yathaa iha sarvagataanaam amoortaanaam jaati guna aadeenaam svatah kriyaa<br>
naasti, kintu aashraya dvaaraa deshaantara praaptih |</strong></em> <em>Jaati, guna</em>, are also present everywhere - *deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi *- so many <em>jaatis</em> are there in all the beings. We see <em>jaati, guna</em> everywhere. They are all amoorta. <em>Jaati</em> cannot move. We cannot separate <em>guna</em> from <em>dravya</em> in which it is residing. Through the object in which it is residing, movement happens for *jaati, *<em>guna</em>. Like this, through the object in which it is residing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Evam amoortasya aatmano api deha dvaaraa deshaantara praaptih, yathaa<br>
savaahanasya pangoh |</strong></em> In the same way, <em>aatman</em> also is <em>amoorta</em>, like a lame person who sits on a vehicle and moves. Just like this, the <em>jeevaatman</em> also needs an <em>aashraya</em> for movement. He has <em>deha</em> as <em>aashraya</em>. When he dies, he takes <em>sookshma shareera</em> from body to body. Even when he goes to <em>moksha</em>, there is <em>sookshma shareera</em>. Due to the power of <em>upaasanaa</em> or <em>prapatti</em>, he gets a special <em>sookshma shareera</em> using which he goes in <em>archiraadi maarga</em>. So, he needs a <em>deha</em> for <em>aashraya</em> for movement. ***<br>

paarthiva | * Upabhoga nimittam cha sarvatra gamana kriyaa | * Upabhoga<br>
nimittam cha deshaat deshaantara aagamah * ityaadi |*** It was told earlier in this <em>Vishnu Puraana</em> itself. <em>Bharata</em> told this to the *Souveera *<em>Raaja</em> in the beginning, when <em>Souveera Raaja</em> said that &ldquo;You are carrying my palanquin, and I am being carried&rdquo;, that &ldquo;You and I are all being carried by the <em>pancha bhootaas</em>&rdquo;. The same questions - &ldquo;Where are you coming from&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where are you going&rdquo;, were asked by <em>Souveera Raja</em> to <em>Bharata</em> also. He had said that a person moved everywhere in order to experience the results of one&rsquo;s <em>karma</em> only. <em>Bhoga</em> is <em>karma phala anubhava</em>. This is the reason why <em>jeevaatman</em> moves around in different <em>dehaas</em>; for every <em>karma</em>, the <em>phala</em> is very well decided that in this particular <em>deha</em>, in this particular place, <em>desha</em>, in this particular time, <em>kaala</em>, he will be experiencing this. This is very well decided. In order to experience that, he takes a particular body, goes to a particular place, at a particular time, and experiences the results of <em>karmaas</em>. One moves around from place to place to experience the <em>karma phala</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Evam poorva apara virodhaat ayam eva arthah | Asya tava etat vachah katham<br>
arthavat iti anvayah |</strong></em> So, in order that there is no contradiction between what was taught earlier and what is taught now, this is how the meaning has to be understood. Because of this, how can you ask &ldquo;Where are you coming from?&rdquo; , &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;, etc. Because he can be present in anybody, anywhere, and is all pervading. He resides in a body and can move around anywhere. He is very <em>sookshma</em>, can enter into the Page <strong>274</strong> of **297<br>

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **<em><strong>Tat manah samataa aalambi kaaryam saamyam hi muktaye ||</strong></em> Do ponder over <em>mrushta, amrushta</em>, whatever I said. Knowing the reality, your mind has to have a <em>samatva buddhi</em>, that they are all deha <em>dharmaas</em>, they are not <em>svaabhaavika</em> for the food. All this happens to a particular person because of the <em>karma</em>, and <em>aatman</em> is not really associated with all these things. Because of the <em>karma</em>, because of the <em>upaadhi</em> that he has got a body, that he is enjoying, doing all these things, but they are not in reality the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>aatman</em>.</p>
<p>In all the bodies, it is in the same way. All the <em>jeevaatmans</em> in all the bodies are similar. Knowing all these is <em>samatva</em>. That will lead you to <em>moksha</em>.</p>
<p>The *saamya, samatvam yoga uchyate *- is told in <em>Geetha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Upasamharati tat etat iti | Etat - aatmano deha vyatiriktatva aadikam uktam<br>
artha jaatam, jnyaatvaa | Mrushta amrushta vichaari iti upalakshanam |<br>
Mrushtam idam amrushtam idam, devo aham manushyah aham ityaadi karma<br>
kruta bheda avalambi yat manah tat aatmanaam jnyaana eka aakaaratvena<br>
samatvaalambi kaaryam | Anusamhitam hi saamyam muktaye bhavati |</strong></em> He concludes with this. Whatever is explained, all this, that he is different and distinct from the body, knowing that, &hellip; all these are because of <em>karma</em>. But, when the mind thinks that they are all <em>aatma dharmaas</em>, then that is not correct; that <em>bheda</em> is not there. All these <em>bheda</em> that &ldquo;I am <em>deva</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am <em>manushya</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is <em>mrushta</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is <em>amrushta</em>&rdquo; is not there; all the <em>aatmans</em> are of the same essential nature as <em>jnyaana</em>, that is what one has to understand, and experience. When one starts experiencing that, that will lead one to <em>moksha</em>, is told. ***</p>

All this world made of sentients and non-sentients, <em>Vaasudeva</em> is told. <em>Vaasudeva</em> is present everywhere, He is living in all three worlds. He is having every being as His place of residence. Because He lives everywhere, He is called <em>Vaasudeva. Svaroopa</em> is His *shareera. *Page <strong>279</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **<em>Shareera, roopa, vapu, tanu</em>, are told. It is clearly told that <em>aatma</em> is also <em>shareera</em> to Him. These are all told very clearly in the <em>Shrutis. Aatma svaroopa</em> is being explained here. The concluding part of the <em>aatma svaroopa</em>, that mind which thinks that all <em>aatmans</em> are equal or similar, that they are all <em>jnyaana eka aakaara</em>, all are similar in nature, they only will lead one to <em>moksha</em>. Whole world is the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vaasudeva, Paramaatman</em>, that also you have to understand as - the <em>ekatva</em> which is told with respect to <em>aatman</em>, is *jnyaana eka aakaaratayaa *<em>samatvam eva</em>; is the similarity or equality of all being <em>jnyaana eka aakaara</em>. It is not <em>svaroopa aikya</em>. This world which is made up of <em>chit</em> and <em>achit</em>, sentient and non-sentient beings, are all <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vaasudeva</em>; it was also told that one <em>dravya</em> cannot become another <em>dravya</em>; so it cannot be <em>svaroopa aikya</em>, then <em>svaroopa naasha</em> would happen which is not possible. Because of this, the whole world is taken as <em>shareera</em>, as told in <em>Antaryaami Braahmana</em>, in <em>Bruhadaaranyakopanishad</em> in much detail. The whole world is told as <em>shareera</em> of <em>Vaasudeva</em>; <em>aatma</em> and <em>Paramaatman</em> are one, is not the <em>abhipraaya</em> of <em>Maharshi Paraasharar</em> here; so <em>aikya</em> is not meant here.</p>
<p>There is <em>jeeva - Paramaatma saamya</em>, because both are *jnyaana svaroopa. *<em>Jeevaatman</em> is <em>anu, Paramaatman</em> is <em>vibhu</em>, in <em>svaroopa</em> itself. <em>Jeevaatman</em> is <em>anu</em> in <em>svaroopa</em>, but he can be present everywhere, in every body, in every achetana, so he is told to be <em>sarvagata</em>. He can pervade everything, can be moving around everywhere. Through <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, in <em>moksha</em>, he is all-pervading, <em>aanantyaaya kalpate</em>. So, it is not *svaroopa *<em>aikya</em> between <em>aatma</em> and *Paramaatman. Aatma-aatma saamya, aatma-Paramaatma *<em>saamya</em> are told in <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> also. Every <em>aatman</em> is of the same nature as *jnyaana *<em>eka aakaara</em>. So, it is not identity, it is similarity. The <em>shareera vaachi shabdaas</em> also denote the <em>shareeri</em>. So, &quot; <em>aham</em>&quot; can go up to <em>shareeri</em> also. So, any name told can also go up to <em>Paramaatman</em>. So, every name, and every form - there is a <em>jeevaatman</em> and <em>Paramaatman</em> also. He is <em>antaryaami</em>, present as <em>aatman</em> in everything. So, all names and forms can also denote <em>Paramaatman</em> in the ultimate analysis, <em>aparyavasaana vrutti</em>.</p>
<p><em>Chetana achetana aatmaka jagat</em> is <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s shareera, Vaasudeva shareera</em>. It is not told that <em>aatman</em> and <em>Paramaatman</em> are one.</p>

<p>We have one more Chapter left in this <em>Amsha</em>. In Chapter 15, <em>Mahaayogi Bharata</em> was reciting the story of <em>Rubhu</em> and <em>Nidaagha</em> to <em>Souveera Mahaaraaja</em>, and he teaches him that <em>aatma jnyaana</em> and then leaves that place. After that, again, he comes, visits after a long time, and this is continued in Chapter 16.</p>
