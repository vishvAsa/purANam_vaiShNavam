Braahmanah -   
Rubhuh varsha sahasre tu samateete nareshvara |   
Nidaagha jnyaana daanaaya tat eva nagaram yayou ||*** *Bharata *\(to *Souveera Mahaaraaja*\) - After one thousand years, *Rubhu * again comes back. In order to teach him, do the complete *upadesha * of *Aatma jnyaana*, he comes back to the same place. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Uktasya aatma saamyasya darshanam chira kaala yoga saadhyam iti   
uttaraadhyaayena uchyate - rubhuh ityaadinaa | ***After thousand years, he comes back. Why does he come back? *Rubhu * knew that whatever he had taught to *Nidaagha*, takes a long time to put to practice. That *jnyaana * has to come through *anushthaana*. It is a difficult thing and takes a long time. One has to be practicing this yoga for a long time. Then only, they can reach the perfection of *aatma saamya darshana*. So, he comes back after a thousand years. This also shows the compassion of the *aachaarya*, that they do not leave the *shishyaas * half way through. They teach and make sure that the *jnyaana * is brought to *anusthanaa*. They themselves come and teach.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 2:   
Nagarasya bahih so atha nidaagham dadrushe munih |   
Mahaabala pareevaare puram vishati paarthive || ***When he came, outside the city, he saw *Nidaagha*. At the same time, *Paarthiva*, the king was entering the city, with all his force and his *parivaara*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 3:   
Doore sthitam mahaabhaagam jana sammarda varjakam |   
Kshut kshaama kantham aayaantam aranyaat sa samit kusham || ****Nidaagha * wanted to avoid the crowd, and so was standing at a distance alone. He had gone to the forest to collect *samit * and *darbha*; having collected all that, he was hungry and thirsty. He was waiting for the crowd to pass, and did not want to get mixed up in the crowd. He was standing alone at a distance.

Drushtvaa nidaagham sa rubhuh upagamya abhivaadya cha |   
Uvaacha kasmaat ekaante stheeyate bhavataa dvija ||*** *Rubhu * saw *Nidaagha * at a distance, and goes near *Nidaagha * and does *abhivaadana*. "Why are you standing alone at a distance, O *Brahmin*", he asked him. 



This *Rubhu * does in order for *Nidaagha * not to realize who he was. *Nidaagha * would think that he is some *brahmin*, who has come there, not being able to recognize him. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 5:   
Nidaaghah -   
Bho vipra jana sammardo mahaan esha nareshvarah |   
Pravivikshuh puram ramyam tena atra stheeyate mayaa ||*** *Nidaagha *- O *Brahmin*, this king is followed by a huge crowd, and is wanting to enter the city with his huge crowd. That is why I am standing here, so that they can all pass, so that I can avoid this crowd. 



*Pravetum icchuh pravivikshuh *- desirous of entering \(the city\). ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 6:   
Rubhuh -

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Naraadhipa iti | Naraadhipah atra katama iti | Na ekasmin api aatmani   
naraadhipatva aadi visheshanam pashyaami iti bhaavah | ****Rubhu * was actually hinting that he is seeing only *aatmans * everywhere, because he had that *aatma darshana*. He did not differentiate between king and another person. He was not seeing those external forms. He had realized the *aatman*. So, he was not able to see the *naraadhipatva * and other attributes in these *aatmans*. He saw *aatmans * as *jnyaana eka aakaaraas*. "I am not able to see any attributes in these *aatmans * like *naraadhipatva, jaati*, position, etc."

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Bhaava aparijnyaanaat aaha yo ayam iti | Parilokah - parijanah | ****Rubhu * had said that he is seeing *aatmans * only, and is not seeing the *naraadipatva*, and other things. He is not able to understand that. So, *Nidaagha * starts to explain in an innocent way as though the *Brahmin * who is asking the question does not know that the person sitting on the elephant is the king and all the people are his *parivaara*. So, he explains like that. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 8:   
Rubhuh -   
Etou hi gajaraajaanou yugapat darshitou mama |   
Bhavataa na visheshena pruthak chinha upalakshanou ||*** *Rubhu *- You showed me both together. You said that one who is sitting on the elephant is the king, and others surrounding him are the others. You just said that he is this, and others are that. At the same time you should me both. But you did not give the specific characteristics of each. You did not tell me clearly the specific characteristics of king and others - their distinguishing marks. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Etou hi iti | Ayam ayam iti hastamudrayaa etou darshitou | Na mayaa gajatvena

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 10:   
Nidaaghah -   
Gajo yo ayam adho brahman upari yasya esha bhoopatih |   
Vaahya vaahaka sambandham ko na jaanaati vai dvija ||*** *Nidaagha *- O *Brahmin*, are you not able to understand even this much? The elephant is below, and one who is sitting on the top is the king. There is *vaahya vaahaka **sambandha *- one who is being carried and one who is carrying. The elephant is carrying the king; elephant is below and king is on top. Who does not know this?

Braahmanah -   
Iti uktah sahasaa aaruhya nidaaghah praaha tam rubhum |   
Shrooyataa kathayaame esha yat maam pariprucchasi || ****Bharata *- Immediately, *Nidaagha * climbs up on a stone, a platform, and stands on that and tells *Rubhu *- "I am going to show you with an illustration". ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 13:   
Upari aham yathaa raajaa tvam adhah kunjaro yathaa |   
Avabodhaaya te brahman drushtaanto darshito mayaa ||*** O *Brahmin*, you are *shreshta*, I am showing you only in order to teach you, not to disrespect you. I am standing above, just like the king, and you are below, just like the elephant. I am telling only in order to teach you. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Upari iti | Aarohana kriyayaa eva uttaram darshayan tat atikrama dosham   
pariharati drushtaanta iti | ***By the act of climbing up, he showed him the answer. The *Brahmin * is very respectable. Looks like he showed disrespect, for this he is telling, I am only giving you an example, and not showing you disrespect. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 14:   
Rubhuh -   
Tvam raajaa eva dvija shreshtha sthito aham gajavat yadi |   
Tat eva tvam mamaachakshva katamah tvam aham tathaa ||*** *Rubhu *- If you are like king, if I am standing like the elephant, now you please explain me "Who are you and who am I". 



So he leads him to the *aham, tvam*; so that the *aham artha * is what he is going to teach. Who is *tvam*, and who is *aham*? 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **The difference is only in the form of the body; individual selves do not have this kind of difference; you are telling "You and I", possibly keeping in mind the form of the body. The actual meaning of *tvam * and *aham * is the *aatman * who is very different and distinct from the body. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 15:   
Braahmanah -   
Iti uktah satvaram tasya pragruhya charanou ubhou |   
Nidaaghah tu aaha bhagavaan aachaaryah tvam rubhuh dhruvam ||*** *Bharata *- Immediately *Nidaagha * realized. He falls at his feet, and holds both his feet. "O *brahmin*, you are definitely my *aachaarya Rubhu * only, I have no doubt about this". ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 16:   
Na anyasya advaita samskaara samskrutam maanasam tathaa |   
Yathaa aachaaryasya tena tvaam manye praaptam aham gurum ||*** I do not think anyone else has this kind of *aatma jnyaana*, as good as my *aachaarya **Rubhu*. I am very sure that my *aachaarya * only has come here, in order to teach me. This kind of mindset of realizing *aatman * everywhere, has realized the *aatman*. This is not possible for anyone else, as my *aachaarya Rubhu*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Na anyasya iti | Advaitam deva aadi dvaita raahityam | ****Advaita * means that the *deva, manushya*, etc. - this kind of *dvaita * is not there. Perceiving the individual self as *aatman * in all the bodies. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 17:   
Rubhuh -   
Tava upadesha daanaaya poorva shushrooshana aadrutah |   
Guru snehaat rubhuh naama nidaagha samupaagatah ||*** *Rubhu *- In order to teach you only, in order to do this *upadesha * only, I was very happy with the desire you had in order to attain this *aatma jnyaana*; I have come because of that. *Aachaaryaas * love their *shishyaas * so much, "Because of that, I am your *aachaarya * and am very compassionate towards you, looking at your desire and your *shraddhaa * in order to attain that *aatma jnyaana*, I have come to you, *Nidaagha*".

He did not realize that there is only one *aatman*, he did not realize like that, because there will be lot of contradictions in this *upadesha*. The *sarva **bhootaani * itself would not make sense in this case. *Brahman * is the self of all the *aatmans*, he saw that *jeevaatman * is also *shareera * of *Brahman*. He realized in that way. This is how one does *upaasanaa*, is told in the *Brahma Sutra*, in Chapter 4, where *Baadaraayana * says that " *Aatma iti tu upagacchanti*", that they all Page **287** of **297

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **do *upaasanaa * thinking that *Paramaatman * is the *aatman*. This is how *Shruti * also teaches them. 



*Shruti * declares very clearly that *Bhagavaan * is *aatma * of everything and even *jeevaatmans*. In *Bruhadaaranyaka Shruti*, it is clearly told that " *Yah aatmani **tishthan aatmaanam antaro, yam aatmaa na veda, yasya aatmaa shareeram, yah **aatmaanam antaro yamayati, sa aatmaa antaryaami amrutah*". So, he says that he is *aatma * to you also. He is in all the *aatmans*, and all *aatmans * are his *shareera*. He is *antaryaami*, is taught in the *Shrutis*. This is how one has to do *upaasanaa*, that *Bhagavaan * is our *aatman*.

Tathaa tvam api dharmajnya tulya aatma ripu baandhavah |   
Bhava sarvagatam jaanan aatmaanam avaneepate || ***O *Souveera Raajaa*, you are one who is knowledgeable about *dharma*, you are *dharmajnya*; you should see equally yourself, your relatives and all your enemies. You should treat all of them equally as all are *jnyaanaikaakaara*. Realizing the *aatman * who is there in all the bodies, you can actually understand that. Do realize that *aatman * everywhere, in all the bodies. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tathaa iti | Sarvagatam - tat tat karma anugunyena tat tat deva aadi deha   
gatam aatma tatvam, ukta prakaaram jaanan tulya aatma ripu baandhavo   
bhava |*** *Aatma svaroopa * is *anu * only - this is clearly told in the *Shrutis*. This *sarvagatatva * is there in various bodies depending on the karma. In order to experience the fruits of the *karma*, he gets different bodies. Whether it is *deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi*, the *aatman * attains those bodies. The *aatman * which is there in all bodies, that is *sarvagata*. Once you realize this, then you will treat everyone equally. 



This is also told as the *lakshana * of a *Vaishnava*, a *prapanna*, that *aatma-suhrut-**vipaksha pakshe sama matih*. ***

They see this as a different thing and that as a different thing. But sky is only one. *Aatma * also who is one, being *jnyaanaikaakaara*, he is seen differently as the body, thinking that the body itself is *aatman*, by those who do not have the correct knowledge.

Sita neela iti | Ekah san jnyaana eka aakarena eka roopah san, deva aadi deha   
praveshaat tat tat roopena bhraantyaa pruthak pruthak drushyate |*** It is *eka roopa * only, it is similarity, and not identity. It is not one, but many of the same nature. When *aatman * is present in various bodies, he is seen as the body itself, as different by those who do not have the right knowledge. 





This *shloka * is explained in *Sri Bhaashya * in great detail. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 23:

So aham sa cha tvam sa cha sarvam etat aatma svaroopam tyaja bheda moham   
||*** Whatever is there, everything is one only. It is *Achyuta*, nothing other than that. Everything that is here is all *Achyuta * only. I am also *Achyuta * only, and you are also that only. All these things are only *aatma svaroopa*. You have to see everything as *eka **aakaara*, and not see the differences, the wrong perception, the *bheda moha * in the body itself and seeing difference in these things. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Atha \* Sakalam jagat vaasudeva abhidheyasya svaroopam paramaatmanah iti   
poorva adhyaaya uktam sarvasya bhagavat aatmakatvam nigamayati eka iti |*** In the previous chapter, it was told that everything is *Vaasudeva Svaroopa*, is His *shareera*. In so many places, it is told very clearly that everything is *Bhagavadaatmaka*. This is concluded here. 



***Yat iha asti kinchit tat samastam eko achyuta eva - tat aatmakam iti arthah |*** This is like *Sarvam khalvidam brahma* - if there is only *Brahma*, then *sarvam * has no meaning. *Eka vijnyaanena sarva vijnyaanam *- if *eka*, it is only one, then *sarva * becomes *mithyaa*, and there is no meaning in telling *sarva vijnyaana*. The meaning is that everything is *Bhagavadaatmaka*. Whatever is there here, that is only one *Achyuta*. Everything is *Bhagavadaatmaka*, having Him as *antaryaami*. 



***Tasmaat tatah param utkrushtam, anyat vyatiriktam cha na asti, tato anyat   
utkrushtam na asti iti vaa |*** Anything superior to Him, there is nothing. Other than Him, there is nothing. There is nothing which is superior to Him also.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **word *tat*, that *tat * is *aatman. Aham, tvam*, etc. are told in *saamaanaadhikaranya*, in the same *vibhakti*. There are multiple words which qualify the same object - multiple attributes qualifying the same object. There is no *paraspara virodha* among these attributes. They can actually qualify the same object - this is *saamaanaadhikaranya. **Bhinna pravrutti nimittaanaam shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih **saamaanaadhikaranyam*. Here, the words *tat, aham, tvam *- are all told. They are all qualifying the same object, *aatman*, which is *jnyaanaikaakaara*. The *aatmans * are different in each. *Tvam * means the *aatman * who is in you. *Aham * means the *aatman * who is in me. Object is *aatman*, but *jnyaanaikaakaara * is what is meant here. The forms of all these are *jnyaanaikaakaara * only. Don't have the wrong understanding that *aatmans * are different. Because of the form of the external appearance that you see, *deva, manushya*, but inside, all are of the similar essential nature. 



***Na tu atra aatmaanam svaroopa bhedo nishidhyate | Tathaa sati deha atirikta   
upadeshasya svaroope aham aham tvam sarvam etat aatma svaroopam iti bheda   
nirdesho na ghatate | ***It is not telling that there is no *bheda * in the *svaroopa * of the *aatman*. But, what is told here is the *aatma svaroopa * which is different and distinct from the body, is what is taught here. *Aham, tvam, sarvam*, would not have made sense if that was not the case. Because the bodies are all different. Appearances are different but *jeevaatman * inside has the same form. *Aham, tvam, sarvam etat*, this *bheda * would not have been possible. 



***Deha aatma viveka vishayam cha ayam upadeshah | Kutah? \* Pindah pruthak   
yatah pumsah shirah paani aadi lakshanah iti prakramaat |*** This *upadesha * is primarily in order to teach the differentiating characteristics of *deha * and *aatman*, that *aatman * is different and distinct from the body. This *viveka **jnyaana * is the purpose of this *prakarana*. How do we say this? *Aatman * is different from body. *Aatman * is different from *indriyaas, aatman * is different from the *manas*, one by one, he teaches. The gist of this is *deha aatma viveka*. What is being taught is that *aatman * is different from the body. This is how the *upadesha * started. Body which is having the head, hand, etc. is different from the *aatman*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 24:

Bharata muni* also, who had *jaati smarana*, who remembered who he was in his previous birth, also attained *moksha * in the same *janma*. Page **290** of **297

He becomes eligible for liberation among the embodied souls. ***
