**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **From one side of *Meru* mountain up to the shell, 25 crores is half of the expanse of the *bhoomi*, 25 crores on one side and 25 crores on the other side, totalling 50 crore *yojanaas*. On the top and below also, it is the same thing, 50 crores. As *Suka* says, between *Soorya anda* and *gola*, it is 25 crores. Compared to the expanse of the *lokaas*, this is 2.5 crores and 3.5 lakhs, double that will be the measure of *Kaanchana bhoomi*, the land of gold, which is 5 crore and 7 lakhs. The remaining 17 crores should be taken as the measure of the *Tama kataaha*. Why *Paraasharar* is telling about these numbers, and the expanses of these islands and oceans is in order to generate *vairaagya*, and the greatness of *Bhagavaan*, who is the Creator of this whole world. If it is such a big expanse, where people are getting created, going through the cycle of births and deaths, how difficult it is to escape from this; one has to get *vairaagya*, various worlds told, various pleasures enjoyed, good things, again, people are in this *prakruti mandala* only, again and again. One should get *vairaagya* understanding all these things, to escape from *samsaara*. This is the purpose of telling these measures. And also to remind us of the greatness of the *Bhagavaan*. He is not very much interested in these numbers and calculations. In whatever way you want to know about the 50 crores, know it. Some people say that half the diameter is 50 crores, and they it has an expanse of 100 crores. This is told in *Varaaha Puraana* also. *Bhoo mandala* is 100 crores. This is told in *Shiva Rahasya, **Skanda Puraana*. 35 crores, 19 lakhs, 40 thousand *yojanaas*. It is said that there is a huge pit filled with water. 1 crore *yojanaas* is the *kataaha*. Between *Soorya **Anda* and *Kataaha*, there is 25 crore *yojanaas*. In *Bhaagavata*, there is also mention of *Soorya*. This is to be understood as the distance lighted by the rays of the Sun. *Shaastreeya angula* is 24 inches, here it is 12 inches; this way, 50 crores becomes 100 crores. Or, we can say that it is 50 crores in one kalpa, and 100 crores in another kalpa. 



We should not look at it that it is correct in one *Puraana* and incorrect in another. It can be difference in *kalpaas*. It can be different in *loukika maana* and *shaastreeya **maana*.
