One in thousand of the <em>sthaavaraas</em> may go and become a <em>krimi</em>, and one in thousand <em>krimis</em> may go to the next one, and so on. Beings in the earlier <em>janmaas</em>, will go to the succeeding ones, in that order. The meaning is that among those beings born in the preceding <em>janmaas</em>, only a very rare one will get the next <em>janma</em>. Only a very rare one will get better and better births. This is also told in <em>Vaayu Puraana</em>, one in thousand among the <em>sthaavaraas</em>, they become insects born of sweat.

Those with not very good <em>karmaas</em>, medium <em>karmaas</em>, what birth one gets, what fruits they get is very difficult to say, as there is so much variety, as told in <em>Aaditya Puraana</em>. The message that <em>Sri Paraasharar</em> is giving in these two <em>shlokaas</em> is how difficult it is for one to attain <em>moksha</em>, getting liberated from this <em>samsaara bandha</em>, and not to tell how many <em>jeevaas</em> are there in each <em>krama</em>, the measure or expanse of the <em>jeevaas</em>. It does not tell the number or count of the <em>jeevaas</em> in these different kinds of beings, because those who are in <em>svarga</em> and in <em>naraka</em> are innumerable. There are innumerable number of beings in heaven, and suffering in hell. All the beings are going in that order till they attain <em>moksha</em>. Once they get liberated, there is no further birth for them.</p>

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **If one does <em>Brahma hatya</em>, not knowingly, one has to do <em>praayaschitta</em> for 12 years; knowingly if one does <em>Brahma hatya</em>, it is twice that, 24 years; if it is repeated, knowingly, it is twice that, 48 years; if one has repeated again and again, it is twice that, 96 years. For one who encourages another to do, or knowingly helps one to do, one who has not directly done, it is one quarter less <em>praayaschitta</em>, compared to what is told for the actual doer. One who has had some benefit out of that, for him, it is half the <em>praayaschitta</em>. For one who permits, it is three-fourths less <em>praayaschitta</em>. For those who simply encourage, it is still less. Depending on the involvement, whether one is the actual doer, one who helped in some way, one who takes some benefit out of that, one who simply permits him to do, one who motivates - like this, there are different kinds of sins, <em>praayaschittaas</em> told. Those who have done *mahaa *<em>paatakaas</em> out of ignorance, 12 years <em>praayaschitta</em> is told, that will cleanse the person. Those who have done knowingly, as told in the <em>Smrutis</em>, they can do all the <em>vyavahaaraas</em>, and they will not go to hell, if they do the <em>praayaschitta</em>. Even if it is twice the 12 years, for those who have done knowingly, for a doer, he will have to go and experience <em>naraka</em>.

Whatever <em>Svaayambhuva Manu</em> and others have told - various kinds of <em>praayaschittaas</em> for the different degrees of sins that people have done, for the direct doer, for one who encourages, knowingly, unknowingly, repeatedly, etc. - whatever <em>praayaschittaas</em> are told - they will make one get rid of only that particular sin. Like this, there may be hundreds of thousands of sins; if one starts to do <em>praayaschittaas</em>, any number of births will not be sufficient. One will be able to get rid of only that particular sin by performing that *praayaschitta. Sri Engal *<em>Aalwaan</em> quotes *Shruti *- one who sins once, will do another sin; so a sinner has a tendency to do sin more and more; he will be sinning again and again. One will do a sin; he will do <em>praayaschitta</em>; he will do one more sin and one more <em>praayaschitta</em>. All the <em>praayaschittaas</em>, whether it is for big sins, or for mild sins, also in different <em>deshaas</em>, different <em>kaalaas</em>, one which destroys all the sins, irrespective of which place it is done, which time it is done, whether big sin or small sin, and that which will also prevent one from sinning again, from involving more and more in sin, and which will also give one <em>saakshaat moksha</em> itself, that which is superior to all the <em>praayaschittaas</em> combined together, that great <em>praayaschitta</em>, that which is very clearly told and accepted by all the <em>Upanishads, Shrutis, Smrutis, <em><em>Puraanaas</em> is</em> Krishnaanusmarana. Tapa</em> means <em>upavaasa</em> and others, <em>karma</em> is <em>yajnya, <em><em>daana</em>, etc. Meaning of <em>anusmarana</em> is uniquely explained here by Sri <em>Engal Aalwaan. <em><em>Anu</em> in</em> anusmarana</em> is in</em> Heenaartha</em> means that I am a very lowly being. <em>Anusmarana</em> means that I am a very lowly being, I am a <em>daasa abhoota</em>, one who has to do <em>kainkarya</em> to the master according to his wish at any point of time, one who is a slave, this kind of <em>anusandhaana</em> is the meaning of <em>anu</em> here. <em>Smarana</em> of <em>Krishna</em> is to be done with <em>sheshatva anusandhaana</em>, that I am <em>shesha bhoota</em> to <em>Bhagavaan, daasa bhoota</em> to <em>Bhagavaan</em>, one has to remember the <em>Bhagavannaama Krishna</em>. If you do not want to suffer, you have to always remember your <em>daasya</em>, your subservience to the Master, who is *Bhagavaan Krishna, *<em>Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Hari. Hari</em> is the <em>svaami</em> and I am the <em>daasa</em>. You have to always remember your <em>svabhaava</em>, and also <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s svabhaava</em> and <em>svaroopa</em>. We are the <em>chetanaas</em> who are <em>shesha bhootaas, daasa bhootaas</em> to <em>Bhagavaan</em>. All the <em>aatmaas</em> are <em>daasa bhootaas</em> to <em>Paramaatman. Kshetrajnya</em> is a <em>jeevaatman</em>, one which has a <em>kshetra</em>, a body. That which cleanses a <em>kshetrajnya</em> of all his sins is the knowledge of nature and relationship with <em>Eeshvara</em>, the nature of <em>Eeshvara</em>, the nature of one&rsquo;s own self; this is the ultimate purity for him. How can one *Krishna *<em>anusmarana</em> be superior to all the *praayaschittaas *- it is superior to all <em>praayaschittaas</em> told for whatever sin one has done at any place and any time, it will prevent one from sinning again, and it also leads to <em>moksha</em>, it is told as param; it Page <strong>80</strong> of **297<br>

<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **is told that in the Upanishads, one spark of fire is enough to burn a huge mass of cotton completely without any residue, just like this, one <em>anusmarana</em> of <em>Krishna</em> can burn all the sins, so it is superior to all the <em>praayaschittaas</em>. This <em>anusmarana</em> is also an indication of <em>keertana, smarana</em>, and others told in <em>navavidha bhakti</em>. It will come later about <em>japa, keertana</em>.</p>
<p><em>Desha, kaala,</em> etc. also decide the degree of sin. For example, if one does sin in *punya *<em>kshetra</em>, the effect is much more, and more <em>praayaschitta</em> has to be done.</p>

The explanation for <em>anusmaranam</em> is *sheshatva *<em>anusandhaana poorvaka smaranam</em>, that I am utterly subservient to *Bhagavaan *<em>Krishna</em>. We have to think of our utter subservience to <em>Bhagavaan</em>, and utter the sacred name of <em>Bhagavaan Krishna</em>.

The greatness of <em>smarana</em> and <em>keertana</em> is told. Day and night one who remembers <em>Bhagavaan</em>, for him all the <em>paapaas</em> will get destroyed. If one remembers during day, the <em>paapaas</em> get destroyed. If one remembers during night, the <em>paapaas</em> get destroyed. If one <em>smarana</em> can destroy the <em>paapaas</em>, why should one remember again and again? How can <em>paapa kshaya</em> happen again when all Page <strong>81</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **the <em>paapaas</em> are destroyed? Such doubts come. Repeated remembrance destroys *paapa *- it seems it told like this. In some <em>Smrutis</em> it is told - without knowing, or simply if one is remembering, one who is not even in his proper consciousness but telling a <em>Bhagavat naama</em>; it is also told that once if one remembers only, it will destroy everything. In some places it told only once, and somewhere else, it is told that you have to repeat day and night. There seems to be some contradiction here. How can there be no contradiction? Whatever sins that are done, once if you do <em>smarana</em>, it will destroy, it is told. It will not stop at that, again one may sin, due to <em>praarabdha karma</em>; this also will be destroyed by <em>anusmarana</em>. If one does a bad deed, it creates a bad <em>samskaara</em> in him; the corresponding <em>vaasanaa</em> will come and again one will have a tendency to do more sins. This <em>samskaara</em> will be destroyed by <em>anusmarana</em>, so that he does not repeat the sin; it will prevent one from doing the sin; again doing the <em>smarana</em> will have this kind of effect. So there is no <em>virodha</em>. For those who have a repentance and for those who do not repent, is there a difference? For those who repent, is it only one <em>smarana</em>? For those who do not repent, it is again and again - is it like that? This is not the way it is. Those who repent only will do <em>prayaschitta</em>; and the <em>praayaschitta</em> is <em>Krishna anusmarana</em>. For one who repents, because of the repentance, for one who does <em>smarana</em>, repentance along with <em>smarana</em> is destroying the <em>paapa</em> - this is also not the meaning; repentance has no role there; repentance will only lead one to do <em>praayaschitta</em>; but *Bhagavat *<em>Naama</em> itself is so powerful, it is so very capable that it is destroying the sins; it does not need anything else to support it; it is <em>vastu saamarthya</em>, like sunlight dispels darkness. Repentance is the qualification of an <em>adhikaari</em> for doing <em>praayaschitta</em>. One who is qualified by repentance will only do <em>praayaschitta</em>; it becomes an <em>adhikaari visheshana</em>, and not an <em>anga</em> for <em>anusmarana</em>. Some minor doubts, which may arise are being clarified, so that we are sure, and there are no doubt about the power and greatness of <em>naama samsmarana</em>, and all the <em>shlokaas</em> told here - in one <em>shloka</em>, it is told that just once remembrance is enough; another <em>shloka</em> says that we have to remember morning and evening, again and again; there seems to be some apparent contradiction; this is all clarified here, so that we clearly understand the meaning of these <em>shlokaas</em>. One who does <em>smarane</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em> morning and night, for him all the sins will get destroyed. Repeating in the morning and night, again in the morning and night, and so on, doing <em>Hari naama samsmarana</em>. It seems to be meaning that it will destroy sins only if repeated like this. It is told at other place that without being aware, if one does *Hari *<em>samsmarane</em>, or just once remembering His name, is also is enough. It is told that <em>smarana</em> and <em>keertana</em> done just once is enough, for all <em>paapaas</em> to get destroyed. There is no contradiction, was explained earlier. Once if you remember and tell <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> name, it will destroy all accumulated sins so far, and repeated, will prevent one from getting that <em>samskaara</em>; the tendency to commit sins again and again will not be there by repeated <em>samsmarana</em>. The advantage of repeating the name of <em>Bhagavaan Hari</em> is that even this tendency will not be there; this is the Page <strong>82</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) <em><em>purpose of doing <em>smarana</em> in the morning, night, morning, night, etc. So, there is no contradiction there. It is not that one who repents only has to do many times, because one who repents only will do <em>praayaschitta</em>. The eligibility or qualification for one to do <em>praayaschitta</em> is that one should repent. If one does not repent, then he will not even think of <em>praayaschitta</em>. Repentance only qualifies someone to do <em>praayaschitta</em>, and it has no role to play in destruction of the sins. It is mere <em>Harinaama</em> which has the power to destroy the sins. Power of</em> Harinaama</em> is such that it destroys the sins, and there is no <em>apeksha</em> of anything else for that. <em>Anutaapa</em> is not an <em>anga</em> to the <em>praayaschitta</em>, but it is the qualification needed for a person to do <em>praayaschitta</em>.</p>

We cannot compare this with the <em>japa</em> of *Vaasudeva. *<em>Vaasudeva japa</em> is of incomparable excellence, and is a seed for <em>moksha</em> itself. Where are these heaven and other benefits which are impermanent? And where is the benefit of <em>Vaasudeva japa</em>, which is the very seed of liberation itself, an incomparable benefit?</p>
<p><em>Ksheene punye martya lokam vishanti</em>. One who has done <em>yaaga</em> and others and accumulated <em>punya</em>, because of which one will be eligible to become <em>Devendra</em>, and then rule over the <em>devaas</em>; once that <em>punya</em> gets exhausted, one has to get back here. This is <em>punaraavrutti lakshana</em>, and not <em>apunaraavrutti lakshana</em>.</p>

Because of this, again and again doing <em>samsmarana</em>, the good <em>samskaara</em> generated by repeated <em>smarana</em>, destroys the bad <em>samskaara</em> which can again lead one to commit sins. The <em>samskaara</em> born by the repeated remembrance of <em>Bhagavat naama</em>, the <em>samskaara</em> generated from one is told, the others are also included. Even if one listens to <em>Bhagavannaama</em> being told, that itself will destroy one of all sins. *Hari *<em>naama</em>, if it reaches our ears, that itself is enough to destroy all the sins. Very wonderfully <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> explains here. <em>Shravana, keertana, smarana</em>, and all these, being done just once, even though there is no <em>drushta phala</em>, immediately one may not go to <em>moksha</em>; just like the husk of the grain has to be removed by beating it with a stick only, and then it is to be used in <em>yaaga</em>, then this <em>yaaga</em> will be done properly and one will attain <em>svarga</em>, the results will not be seen immediately; for the sins which were accumulated so far, earlier, before reciting the <em>naama</em>, one should not think that he has to repeat again and again as he has not seen the results immediately, because <em>shaastra</em> says that the sins will be destroyed. An example is given here - there is a cave in darkness for nobody knows for how long, from beginningless time, when one lights a lamp there, the darkness gets dispelled immediately; just like this, when one tells <em>Harinaama</em>, all the sins will get destroyed. In order to see that again and again we are not committing sins, after *Harinaama *<em>ucchaarana</em>, which would have destroyed accumulated sins, till one perceives the <em>Brahman</em> directly and immediately, till attaining <em>moksha</em>, one has to keep repeating the name of <em>Hari</em>. The long darkness in the cave was dispelled by lighting a lamp; if that lamp is put off, the darkness can again come in; it needs to be kept burning till the sun rises, because the lamp will not be further required. Till we get <em>Bhagavat saakshaatkaara</em>, we have to keep repeating the name of *Hari. Manu *<em>Dharma Shaastra, Manusmruti</em> are all <em>parama pramaana</em> for us, and are in accordance with the <em>Vedic</em> teachings only. For everything, <em>naama sankeertana</em> is the <em>praayaschitta</em>, was told, whereas in <em>Manusmruti</em>, etc., it is told that you have to Page <strong>86</strong> of **297<br>
<strong><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a></strong></p>
<p>**SrI VishNu PurANam (Vol. 2) **do the <em>praayaschitta</em> for twelve years, twenty four years, etc., which are very difficult to do; when there is a very easy <em>praayaschitta</em> like <em>naama sankeertana</em>; nobody will even try to do those twelve year <em>praayaschittaas</em>; so <em>Manu Shaastra</em> will become futile; the statements of <em>Manu</em> and others cannot become futile, this is a doubt. There is no contradiction here. Those who are interested in doing such <em>praayaschittaas</em>, and those who are turned away from <em>Bhagavaan</em>, and feel so bad having turned away from <em>Bhagavaan</em> that they want to do some difficult <em>praayaschitta</em> only to get rid of the sins, they have so much belief that they want to do only the twelve-year <em>praayascitta</em>, in order to make sure that they will always be remembering <em>Bhagavaan</em> after this; for such people, it is definitely useful. <em>Praayaschittaas</em> told by <em>Manu</em> and others have to be done with <em>shraddhaa</em>. Whereas, <em>Bhagavat smarana</em>, even though one does not have belief, even if someone is telling, becomes a <em>praayaschitta</em>, just like <em>Shishupaala. Shishupaala</em> was ridiculing <em>Bhagavaan Krishna</em>, but he attained <em>moksha</em> after that. Even though people have sinned a lot, and do not have a pure mind, even they, when they remember the name of <em>Hari</em>, the power of the <em>Hari naama sankeertana</em>, is itself such that it destroys the sins for whoever it is. When <em>smarana</em> itself does all the <em>paapa kshaya</em>, the <em>Paandavaas</em> were very much in the company of <em>Krishna</em> all the time; He was such a close guide and friend to them; <em>Yudhishthira</em>, <em>Arjuna</em> and even <em>Balaraama</em>, did <em>teerthayaatraa</em> and such things as <em>praayaschitta</em>, when smarana itself would have destroyed all the sins; they did it because those who are not aware of the power of naama sankeertana, who do not have proper devotion, for them, there has to be a way to get rid of their sins by doing <em>teerthayaatraa</em> etc.; this is to demonstrate to others who are not aware of this means, and who are not very devoted. In this <em>prakarana</em>, various names are told - <em>Hari, Vishnu, Naaraayana</em>; it is said that <em>Harinaama sankeertana</em> will destroy sins, <em>Naaraayana naama</em> will get one liberation, etc. All the names can help attain all the benefits, all the <em>purushaarthaas</em>, is the conclusion. Not that only <em>Vaasudeva naama</em> will help one, and not the others. There is a <em>prakarana</em> in <em>Vishnu Dharma</em>. Just like one <em>naama Vaasudeva</em>, all the <em>naamaas</em> are having the same power. There are many names, thousands of names of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, which are very helpful to the entire world. Some <em>Bhagavannaamaas</em> like <em>Vaasudeva, Achyuta</em>, are told to be helping one to attain <em>moksha</em>. And some other names of <em>Bhagavaan</em> are said to help attain *dharma, *<em>kaama</em>, and other <em>purushaarthaas</em>, are also told. In the end it is concluded, whichever name one desires, he can use that name for any purpose. All the names are concluding in only one particular person <em>Sriman Naaraayana</em>, who is <em>Parabrahman</em>; so they all have the same meaning. All the names of <em>Bhagavaan</em> will help one to attain all the <em>purushaarthaas</em>. ***</p>

<p>We saw Chapter Six, of <em>Amsha</em> Two. <em>Sri Paraasharar</em> had explained the various <em>narakaas</em>, and what kind of sins will lead to those <em>narakaas</em>; he made a list of all the sins and <em>narakaas</em> that people get. In the end, he said that <em>svarga</em> and <em>naraka</em> are nothing but <em>punya paapa; svarga</em> is itself told as <em>punya</em>, because <em>punya</em> leads to <em>svarga</em>; and <em>paapa</em> is told as <em>naraka</em>, as <em>paapa</em> is the <em>kaarana</em> for one attaining <em>naraka</em>. Compared to the <em>sukha</em> of <em>moksha</em>, of attaining <em>Bhagavaan</em>, these are all due to <em>karma</em>; because of <em>karma</em>, one experiences <em>sukha</em> or <em>dukha</em> here. The <em>padaarthaas, vastus</em>, objects by themselves are not <em>sukha</em> or <em>dukha aatmaka</em>, but the experience of happiness, grief, etc. comes due to the <em>karma</em> of the particular <em>chetana</em>. The same object causes happiness to one, and grief to another. At different times, different states, different places, to the same person also, a particular thing causes <em>sukha</em> or <em>dukha</em>. It is not in the nature of those things, but it is due to the karma of the individual that this kind of experiences happen.</p>
<p>One has to do <em>karma</em> which will not bind one. <em>Jnaanam eva param brahma</em>, was told. <em>Jnyaana</em> will lead to attainment of *Paramaatman. Mana eva manushyaanaam *<em>kaaranam bandha mokshayoh</em>, will be told later. Depending on various aspects of the mind, <em>mano vruttis</em>, one gets interested, attached, etc.; this is what binds or releases one. Based on the karma only, one experiences the consequences of the <em>karma</em>, either <em>punya</em> or <em>paapa</em>.</p>
<p><em>Vidyaa</em> and <em>avidyaa</em> were told. <em>Vidyaa</em> is <em>upaasane</em> or <em>prapatti. Avidyaa</em> is *nitya *<em>maimittika karmaas. Karmaas</em> done without any desire in the fruits, without the <em>anusandhaana</em> of <em>mamatva, kartrutva, sanga</em> and <em>phala</em>, with <em>tyaaga</em>, is said to be <em>avidyaa</em> here.</p>
<p>After telling about the <em>pruthivi, bhoo loka, paataalaas</em>, and the <em>narakaas</em>, and the *samudraas, parvataas, dveepaas *- these were all told briefly, <em>Paraasharar</em> asks *Maitreyar *- &lsquo;What else do you wish to know&rsquo;.</p>
