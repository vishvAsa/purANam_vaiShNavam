***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 1:    
Sri Paraasharah -   
Nishamya tasyeti vachah paramaarthasamanvitam |   
Prashrayaa avanato bhootvaa tamaaha nrupatih dvijam ||*** *Sri Paraasharar* - The king understood that what he is talking is about *paramaartha*. Listening to that, with lot of obedience and bowing down to him, the king told the *Braahmana * thus. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Poorvaadhyaaye dehaadi vyatirikta aatmaa iti uktam | Anantarena adhyaayena   
sa eva \[nityatva ananyaarthatva anoupaadhikatva aadibhih\] parama   
purushaartha iti uchyate - nishamya iti | Paramaartha samanvitam   
paramaarthatayaa vakshyamaanena aatmanaa samanvitam tat vishayam |*** In the previous chapter 13, it was told that *aatma * is different from body and *indriyaas*. In Chapter 14, which is following it, the same *aatman * is now said to be *parama purushaartha*, because he is *nitya*, he is not meant for enjoyment of *prakruti, prakruti * is meant for him, *aatma * is *ananyaartha, aatman * is not *upaadhi*. Body and others are not *nitya. Prakruti * is *anyaartha*. Body comes due to *upaadhi. **Jeevaatma svaroopa * is *nirupaadhika aananda maya*, existing as it is. Because of all these differences, it is *parama purushaartha*, is going to be told here. Whatever *aatman * is told as *paramaartha * here, is the meaning of *paramaartha **samanvitam*.

Raajaa uvaacha -   
Bhagavan yat tvayaa proktam paramaartham ayam vachah |   
Shrute tasmin bhramanti iva manaso mama vruttayah ||*** King said - Whatever you told, all the words talking about *paramaartha*, my mind is completely immersed in that wandering in those thoughts only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **utmost use, *parama prayojana*. Now, I want to listen about how it is the *paramaartha*; that my mind is fully anxious to know.

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 3:    
Etat viveka vijnyaanam yat ashesheshu jantushu |   
Bhavataa darshitam vipra tat param prakruteh mahat ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Uktam anuvadan evam prashamsati etat iti | Yat cha prakruteh viveka   
vijnyaanam asti tat viveka vijnyaanam yat etat ashesha jantushu anuvruttam |   
Viveka vijnyaanam aatma tattvam, tat prakruteh param - vilakshanam mahat   
cha | ***Whatever was told, he is repeating and praising that. Whatever is the *viveka **vijnyaana*, you told, from *prakruti*, differentiating the knowledge of the special characteristics of *aatman*, which distinguishes it from *prakruti*, that knowledge; and that which is present in all the beings. *Viveka vijnyana * means the *aatman*, which is different and superior to the *prakruti*.

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 4:

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 5:    
Gunapravruttyaa bhootaanaam pravruttih karma choditaa |   
Pravartante gunaa hi ete kim mama iti tvayaa uditam || ***The various actions and activities of the beings, it is all because of the *karma*; it happens because of the influence of *gunaas, sattva, rajas, tamas*, which are *gunaas * of *prakruti*, all the time having influence on the *jeevaatman*. This association with *prakruti * has come because of karma. And this is what is making him do various things he is doing here, engaged in so many activities here. Qualities of *prakruti, sattva, rajas, tamas * only are actually responsible for that, and they are only doing all these; it is not mine.

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 6:    
Etasmin paramaarthajnya mama shrotra patham gate |

I feel that I have listened to what one ought to listen.

Braahmana uvaacha -

Now, you are talking about *paramaartha*. What is it that you are asking - is it *shreyas * or *paramaartha*? All the *shreyas * that is seen here, is all *aparamaartha * only, and not *paramaartha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

Aparamaarthaarthaani aparamaartha vastooni; aarshatvaat artha shabdasya

What is taught here is *aatma jnyaana*. Other than *aatma jnyaana*, all others are told as *shreyas * here. *Aatma jnyaana * is told as *paramaartha * here. Among them, which one are you asking, is what he asks. All the objects of enjoyment seen here are all * aparamaartha*. 





## 13
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 13:    
Devataaraadhanam krutvaa dhanasampadam icchati |   
Putraan icchati raajyam cha shreyah tat praapti lakshanam ||*** One by one, he talks about *shreyas*. And then differentiates it from *paramaartha*. By worshipping all the gods like *Indra, Varuna, Agni*, through *yajnya, yaaga*, they want lot of wealth. Or they want children, or kingdom. These are all said to be *shreyas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

devataa iti tribhih | Devataaraadhanam iti | Tat praapti lakshanam teshaam   
dhana aadeenaam praapti-roopam |*** Starting with wealth, each one is little better than the other, each one is relatively better than the other. *Dhana, putra, raajya*, ... - seven kinds of *shreyas * are told here, by these three *shlokaas*. One is *devataaraadhana*. What is attained from *devataaraadhana * is the *dhana, putra, raajya, * etc. 





## 14
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 14:

Shreyah pradhaanam cha phale tat eva anabhisamhite ||*** Page **253** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **The various *yajnya yaagaas * which are done, various *karmaas*, are also *shreyas*, after which they go and attain the *svarga lokaas * and enjoy there. The *karma * which is of the form of *yajnya * and others, which gives fruits of *svarga * and others, is also *shreyas * only. When these *karmaas * are done without desire in fruit, that is also primary *shreyas*, it is said. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Karma iti | Phale anabhisamhite sati, tat eva karma mukhyam shreyah | ***This karma being done, becomes more important than the earlier ones. 





## 15
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 15:    
Aatmaa dhyeyah tadaa bhoopa yoga yuktaih tathaa param |   
Shreyah tasya eva samyogah shreyo yat paramaatmanaa || ***Those who are engaged in *yoga*, they meditate on the *aatman*, they do *dhyaana*. Doing *dhyaana*, meditation, is *shreyas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Aatmaa iti | Aatmaa dhyeya iti shreyah - tat dhyaanam shreyah iti arthah |   
Tasya eva jeevasya eva paramaatmanaa samyoga aikyam | Shreyo yat

## 16
In further *shlokaas*, all these are talked about and it is told why these are *shreyas*, and nor *paramaartha*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 16:    
Shreyaamsi evam anekaani shatasho atha sahasrashah |   
Santi atra paramaarthastu na tu ete shrooyataam cha me ||*** Like this, there are many things which are said to be *shreyas * here. Hundreds and thousands of things which are called *shreyas*. None of these are *paramaartha*, I will tell you what is *paramaartha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

## 17
He is going to talk about why each one is not *paramaartha*. Each one is told as *shreyas * only. First, he tells about why money is not *shreyas*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 17:    
Dharmaaya tyajyate kim nu paramaartho dhanam yadi | ***Page **254** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) *****Vyayah cha kriyate kasmaat kaama praapti upalakshanah ||*** In order to do *dharma*, money is given up, they engage in dharma. One renounces the wealth, and also spends a lot of money for *dharma*. If something is spent or given up, that cannot be *paramaartha*. This is only for attaining some desire. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Dhanaadeenaam shreyastvam kramena niraakaroti - dharmaaya ityaadi | Kaama

anyaartham sah paramaarthah; sa aatmaa eva iti bhaavah; \* Aatmanah tu   
kaamaay sarvam priyah bhavati iti shruteh |*** One by one, in order, that all these are not *shreyas*, are established in these *shlokaas*. In order to attain certain desires, money is spent. That which is spent, or given up or renounced, cannot be *paramaartha. Dharma * and *kaama * among the *purushaarthaas*, and *dhana * is spent. By itself, *dhana * is not *purushaartha*. That for the sake of which everything is meant, that which is not meant for others, that is what can be *paramaartha*. Everything is to serve the purpose of that, and that is not meant for others; that is *paramaartha*. The meaning is that *aatma * is only *paramaartha*. This is also told in *Bruhadaaranyaka Upanishad * that everything happens and exists as per the *sankalpa* of the *aatman * only. Everything is meant for attaining the *aatman*, and *aatman * is not meant for others. That is how it is *paramaartha*. 





## 18
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 18:    
Putrah chet paramaarthah syaat so api anyasya nareshvara |   
Paramaarthabhootah so anyasya paramaartho hi tat pitaa ||*** If you say that *putra * is *paramaartha*, that is also meant for someone else. For a father, *putra * is *paramaartha*, but for a *putra*, his *putra * becomes *paramaartha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Putrah chet iti | So api anyasya - sva pituh; paramaarthah | Tat pitaa cha

## 19
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 19:    
Evam na paramaartho asti jagati asmin chara achare |   
Paramaartho hi kaaryaani kaaranaanaam asheshatah ||*** In this world having movables and immovables, these are all not *paramaartha. **Kaaryaas * are all *paramaartha * with respect to the *kaarana * only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Asheshena putra aadi kaaryaani kaaranaanaam hi - janakaanaam paramaarthah; ***Page **255** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) *****tasmaat na paramaarthah | Ananya artho hi paramaarthah | ***Son is *paramartha * for father. Father is *kaarana*, son is *kaarya*. So, it is not absolute *paramaartha*, but only relative with respect to the father. *Paramaartha * is *ananyaartha*.

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 20:    
Raajyaadi praaptih atra uktaa paramaarthatayaa yadi |

asthiratvam putraadishu api samaanam |*** One day you have a vast kingdom, on the next day, someone will come and conquer your kingdom; so you have no more your kingdom. It is not permanent. So, it cannot be *paramaartha*. They are all not permanent, it is the same way with *putra*, and others. 





## 21
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 21:    
Rig yajus saama nishpaadyam yajnya karma matam tava |   
Paramaartha bhootam tatra api shrooyataam gadato mama ||*** If you think that *yajnya * and other *karmaas*, which are basically done with *Rig, Yajus, **Saama * and other *Veda mantraas *- if you think that that is *paramaartha*, even with respect to that, listen to me, I will tell you why that is also not *paramaartha*. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Dharmasya nashvaratvam anumaanena darshayati - rig ityaadinaa |*** From these three *shlokaas*, it is told that *dharma * is also *nashvara*. So, it is also not *purushaartha*. 





## 22
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 22:    
Yat tu nishpaadyate kaaryam mrudaa kaarana bhootayaa |   
Tat kaarana anugamanaat jnyaayate nrupa mrunmayam ||*** Whatever is created, the effect, *kaarya * pot and others, from mud which is the cause, that is known only because *kaarana * is continuing in that. Lump of mud became pot, but we identify that also as mud only. Everything is *mrunmaya, Mruttiketi eva **satyam*, says *Upanishad*. From mud whatever is made is *mrunmaya*, everything is *mrunmaya. Mrut * is continuing everywhere. *Kaarana * is continuing there.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) *****Evam vinaashibhih dravyaih samit aajya kusha aadibhih |   
Nishpaadyate kriyaa yaa tu saa bhavitree vinaashinee ||*** And that *mrunmaya*, whatever pot is created from *mrut*, which is told as *mrunmaya*, the mud got destroyed and pot came. When the pot got destroyed, *kapaala * comes. *Kapaala * is also *mrunmaya*, but the previous state is destroyed. It is *vinaashi * because it is created from a *vinaashi dravya * only. It is not *avinaashi*, as it undergoes changes in its essential nature itself. Similarly, *yajnya * is also like that. *Yajnya * is performed with *samit, darbhaa*, and ghee and other *aajyaas*. All those are *vinaashi dravyaas*, which get destroyed, and keep undergoing changes, in their essential nature itself. *Yajnya * which is an outcome of using all these things is also not permanent. Once the *yajnya * is completed, it is also over. The set of acts, the *yajnya*, which is performed with all these ingredients, that also has to get destroyed sometime; it will get ended sometime, and there will be no *yajnya * afterwards; so it is also temporary only. 





## 24
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 24:    
Anaashee paramaarthah cha praajnyaih abhyupagamyate |

What is obtained from a *naashi dravya*, material itself undergoing change or getting destroyed, that again cannot be permanent, and that also is *naashi * only, gets destroyed, keeps changing its state, undergoes modifications. 





## 25
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 25:    
Tat eva aphaladam karma paramaartho matah tava |   
Mukti saadhana bhootatvaat paramaartho na saadhanam ||*** Next, the *aphaladam karma, karma * done with *anabhisamhita phala, phala abhisandhi **rahita karma*, without desire in *phala*, in the fruits, the karma which is done, if you think that is *paramaartha*, it is only *saadhanaa * for *mukti. Saadhanaa * itself cannot be *paramaartha*. Means itself cannot become the *saadhana*, because it is the means to attain *moksha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tat eva iti | Tat eva - yajnya karma eva | Chet na iti adhyaahaarah | Na hi   
paramaartho anyasya saadhanam | ****Paramaartha * cannot be the means for attaining something else. 



*Dhana, putra, raajya, karma * obtained from *rig-yajus-saama*, and also *karmaas * done using the *naashi dravyaas*, are all not permanent. Only *avinaashi * is *paramaartha. **Paramaartha * is not *anyaartha*, it is *ananyaartha. Aparamaartha * is all *anyaartha. **Phala abhisamhita rahita karma * is also not *paramaartha*, because *saadhanaa * is not *paramaartha*.

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) ***Dhyaana * is told, and couple of more things will be told. Then it will be told as to what is *paramaartha*, in the next few *shlokaas*. 



We are at the end of *Amsha * 2, Chapter 14, where the *Mahaa yogi Bharata * is teaching *Souveera Raaja*, what is *aatma jnyaana * and what is *paramaartha*. He shows how money and other things are not *paramaartha*, because they get spent, and how the kingdom and other things are also not *paramaartha*. They are all not permanent. Also the *yajnya karma * is also not *paramaartha*, because *yajnya karma * is performed with materials which themselves get destroyed - they are all *naashi dravyas*, like *samit, kusha*, etc. Something obtained from *naashi dravyaas * cannot be permanent - so it is also not *paramaartha*. If *karmaas * are done without desire in fruits, *phala anabhisamhita karma*, that is also not *paramaartha * because that is *paramparayaa saadhana * to *moksha*. That which is *saadhana * is not *paramaartha*. 





## 26
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 26:

- smruti pratyayatvena kshana bhanguratvaat | Na tu paramaartho bhangurah |*** *Aatma dhyaana * is not the *parama prayojana bhoota vastu*. It differentiates from *ghata * and other things - the *aatma dhyaana*, and that is one reason why it is not *paramaartha*. It creates different kinds of experiences, like vivid, more vivid, most vivid, like this - there are *avasthaa bhedaas*, which are not there in the *paramaartha. Paramaartha * cannot have these kinds of differences in experience. There is one more explanation given - *dhyaana * is nothing but *anusmruti, **smruti * after *smruti*, continuous remembrance of the object of meditation; every instant it is a separate remembrance; so instant after instant, without any break in between and without any other thought coming in between, one has to meditate upon the object of meditation. Because it has to be meditated upon every instant, it stays for one *kshana*, and then another *kshana - paramaartha * cannot be like that. 





## 27
The next one is a very important *shloka*, which is quoted in many places. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 27:    
Paramaatmaatmaatmano yogah paramaartha iti eeshyate |   
Mithyaa etat anyat dravyam hi na eti tat dravyataam yatah ||*** *Yoga * means *sambandha*, in this case, it means *aikya*, because the second part of the *shloka * says *mithyaa etat*. What is false, *mithya * is the *paramaatma-aatma aikya*, identity. If you like to think that *aikya * of *paramaatma * and *aatma * is *aikya*, then that is not true, it is false, because such a thing cannot happen at all. Because Page **258** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **one *dravya * cannot become another *dravya*. 



This is also told by *Sri Nammaalvaar * in *Tiruvaimoli, Koodaamaiyai koodinaalum **aduvum aduve iduvum iduve*; even if *Paramaatman * and *jeevaatman * go and merge, *Paramaatman * remains *Paramaatman * only, and *jeevaatman * remains *jeevaatman * only. There is so much difference and distinction between them that one cannot become the other. The second reason is that there is no *svaroopa naasha * in any of these. *Kaarya * is *avasthaantaraapatti*, even *kaarya * merges into *kaarana*. For *achetana*, there is *svaroopa vikaara*, but there is no *svaroopa naasha*. For *chetanaas*, there is no *vikaara * in *svaroopa * also. So, *Paramaatman * and *jeevaatman * cannot become united where *jeevaatman * loses its *svaroopa * itself. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Paramaatma iti | Ishyate yadi iti sheshah | Yogah taadaatymyam, anyathaa   
uttara ardheh na asangate | Etat aikyam mithyaa; tatra hetuh anyat iti |   
Poorveshu dhana aadishu nashvaratva aadi; yoge tu svaroopa abhaavah |*** *Yoga * is oneness or identity, which is used by other systems of philosophy, as *aikya*. The *taadaatymya * what we say is oneness, *ekee bhaava*, it is not *svaroopa aikya*, but *ekee bhaava*. This is told even in *pralaya*. Otherwise, it will not be proper with the second part of this *shloka*, which says *mithyaa etat. Aikya * is *mithyaa*. The earlier things which were told - *dhana, yajnya karma*, etc. are all *nashvara*, impermanent; they don't remain forever and get destroyed. Whereas here, in *aatma paramaatma **yoga*, what is meant is that if it means *aikya*, then that would be *svaroopa **naasha * itself. That cannot be *paramaartha*, and it is not true at all, because it is *mithyaa*.

Tasmaat shreyaamsi asheshaani nrupa etaani na samshayah |   
Paramaarthah tu bhoopaala sankshepaat shrooyataam mama ||*** Now, he is concluding all the things which he said - which is not *paramaartha*, and which is *paramaartha. Yogi Bharata * is telling what is *paramaartha*. O King, all these things are called *shreyas*, there is no doubt. But they are not *paramaartha*. Listen to me about *paramaartha*, I will tell you. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Upasamharati tasmaat iti | Etaani dhana aadeeni shreyaamsi eva na tu

## 29
From here, he starts to tell about what is *paramaartha*, and *aatma svaroopa*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 29:    
Eko vyaapee samah shuddho nirgunah prakrute parah |   
Janma vruddhi aadi rahitah aatmaa sarvagato avyayah ||*** These are all the attributes of *aatman * told here. Explained below. 



Page **259** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) ***Atman * is one and not like body which has many forms into which it grows. ' *Diha **upachaye*' is the root for the word *deha, * that which grows. And there are so many ' *aneka*' parts of *deha * while *Atman * is one, *Ekah*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Paramaartham aah - eka iti | Ekah - dehavat na anekah upachaya roopah |*** *Eka * means not like *deha. Deha * undergoes *baalya avasthaa, youvana avasthaa, jaraa*, etc., it keeps on changing, there is growth, there is deterioration; whereas *paramaartha*, which is *jeevaatman * is not like that; it is *eka*, remains the same all the time. 



Like the body, he does not have many states, like increasing, decreasing, etc. *Upachaya * means growth. 



***Vyaapee - jnyaanena sarva vyaapana svabhaavah |*** He is *vyaapee*, means that he can pervade everywhere, through his *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*. 



***Deva manushyaadeenaam vishameshu deheshu sthito api samah - parasparam   
cha samah |*** He is *sama*, though he is present in various kinds of bodies which are all very different from each other - one is very big, one is small, they have different characteristics, *deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi, praani*, but in every body, he is similar; all the *aatmans * have the same attributes, same *svaroopa*; they are similar mutually also, all are jnyaana aakaaraas only. 



***Shuddhah - svato nirmalah | Nirgunah - sattva aadi rahitah | Tatra hetuh -   
prakruteh parah - janma aadi shat bhaava vikaara rahitah |*** He is *shuddha*, in his real state, he does not have any defects, but due to *karma*, he has got caught in this *samsaara*. He is *nirguna*, means he does not have the qualities of *prakruti*, which are *sattva, rajas, tamas*; he is superior to *prakruti*; and he also does not have *asti, jaayate, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati *- the six *bhaava vikaaraas*, he does not have all these *bhaava vikaaraas * of *prakruti. Shat **bhaava * means different kinds of characteristics. 



He is bereft of *janma, vruddhi, parinaama, apakshaya, naasha*, which are all for the body only; it is not there for the *jeevaatman*. 



***Aatmaa - chetanah |*** *Aatma* means that it is *chetana*, which is *jnyaana aashrayatva*, he is *aashraya * to *jnyaana*. 



***Sarva gatah - naashakaanaam agni jala aadeenaam soukshmyena vyaapakah |*** *Sarva gata* means that even *agni, jala*, etc, which are all *sookshma*, they destroy other things by entering inside, being *sookshma*, but he is more *sookshma * than that; he can pervade even them. Page **260** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **



***Ato daaha aadi rahitah |*** He does not have *daaha * and others things; he does not get burnt, as he can enter into *agni * also. 



***Avyayah - avikalah |*** He is *niravayavi*, partless. 



These are some of the characteristics of the *aatman* told.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Parajnyaana maya iti | Parajnyaana mayah - prakrushta jnyaana svaroopah |   
Paramajnyaana mayah iti cha paathah | Para shabdena vishaya jnyaanam

***Sukha samvit svaroopa iti arthah |*** He is *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*. 



***Asadbhih - vinaashibhih deva aadi naama roopaih kaala traye api ayuktah |*** *Asad* means those which get destroyed, *naama jaati*, etc. name, class, etc. He never gets associated with that. He was never connected earlier also, and in future also, he will not be associated with *jaati, naama*, etc. No connection with *jaati, naama*, in past, present, future. 



***Vibhuh - deha indriyaanaam svamee; svatah svaraat iti vaa |*** *Vibhu * means he is the Lord of body and *indriyaas*. He is *svaraat*, means when he gets *karma svaatantrya*, he gets released from the bondage of *karma *- he is said to be *sva svaraat bhavati*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Evam eko vyaapee ityaadinaa aatma svaroopam uktam | ***By the words *eka, vyaapee*, etc. the *aatma svaroopa * was told. 



***Idaaneam tasya deva aadi roopeshu aatma paradeheshu sato api eka prakaaram   
yat vijnyaanam vijnyaana roopam asou paramaartha iti aaha - tasya iti |*** After telling about *aatma svaroopa*, though he exists in his own body, and other Page **261** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **bodies, when he is present in *deha, indriya*, and other bodies, of oneself and others, he is always of the same *prakaara, jnyaana svaroopa * only, this is the *paramaartha*, reality of the *aatman*. 



***Deva aadi deheshu sthitasya aatmanah tat roopena bhinnatva prateetih   
bhraantih iti aaha - dvaitena iti |*** Those who see as different, that the *aatman * in one body is very different from the *aatman * in another body, in *svaroopa * also, if he understands like that, that is not correct, not real. Those who see differences or duality in *aatmaas*, that is not real. 





## 32
This is an often quoted *shloka*, and is explained in detail in *Sri Bhaashya*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 32:    
Venu randhra vibhedena bhedah shadja aadi sanjnitah |   
Abheda vyaapino vaayoh tathaa asya paramaatmanah ||*** How it is the same *jnyaana aakaara * in all the bodies, is explained with an example. A flute has many holes, and when the wind is blown, the air goes through each one, and when different holes are covered, different sounds are produced, like *Sa Ri Ga Ma ..., **Shadja, Daivata, Madhyama, Panchama*, etc., with different combinations of the holes. But the same air passes through all of them. When it passes through different holes, it takes different *svaraas*. This way, they are all different, and the air particles which go through each one are also different. They are all independent, but are all air only. They are identified as *shadja*, etc. when they pass through these holes. But by nature, everything is air only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Aatmano hi svaroopena parasparam bhinnaah, na tu deva aadi roopena, teshaam   
atadroopatvasya uktatvaat | ***This is the background which we have to understand before we read this *shloka. **Jeevaatmans * are many, and are different in *svaroopa*. There is a *jeevaatman * in one body, and is another *jeevaatman * in another body. They are not different because of the form of the appearance, *deva, manushya*, etc., but they are *jnyaana aakaaraas*. 



***Kechit atra aatmanaam svaroopena bhedo nishidyata iti aahuh; tat ayuktam | \*   
Tasya aatma paradeheshu, \* Tatra tvam aham api atra, \* Aham tvam cha tathaa   
anye cha, \* Tvam cha anye cha iti aadi aatma bahutva pratipaadaka   
bahuvachana virodhaat, shruti smruti sootra nyaaya virodhaat cha |*** Some say that there is no *bheda * in *svaroopa * also, meaning that there is only one single *aatma * in all the bodies, that there are not multiple *aatmaas *- that is not true. It is told in *Shrutis * that *Nityo nityaanaam chetanah chetanaanaam eko bahoonaam yo **vidhadhaati kaamaan*, this shows multiplicity of *aatmans*. This is told in the *shlokaas * here itself - You are there in that body, and I am here; Myself, you and others also; meaning that each individual self exists separately, is different; there are many individual selves, but all are of the same nature. If we say that *aatman * is only one, in all the bodies, and that there are not multiple *aatmans*, if the *aatma **bahutva * is not told, it is opposed to what was taught here itself in so many *shlokaas*, which are telling about *aatma bahutva*. It is also against *Shruti, Smruti, Nyaaya*, etc. Page **262** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **



***Yadi deva aadi roopena aatmanaam na bhedah, katham tarhi devo ayam,   
manushyo ayam iti vaishamyena vyavahaara upapadyate? Tatra aaha - venu   
randhra iti |*** If there is no difference, *bheda * in the form of *deva, manushya*, etc. how can we even say that this is *deva*, this is *namushya*, etc.? Then everyone should be addressed in the same way. How can we address different individuals differently? This is answered in this *shloka*. 



***Yathaa venoh aneka randhra vartinaam vaayu amshaanaam vaayutvena eka   
aakaaraanaam randhra bheda vinishkramana kruta shadja aadi sanjnyaa   
bhedah; evam aatmanaam jnyaana eka aakaaraanaam deva aadi deha pravesha   
aakruto deva aadi vyavahaarah, na tu taadroopya krutah | ***The *vaayu amshaas*, which are there in various holes, which are all of the same nature as they are all *vaayu * only, they go through different *randhraas*, which cause one to be *Shadja*, another to be *Madhyama*, another to be *Daivata*, the difference exists. In the same way, the *aatmaas*, are of the same nature of *jnyaana*, consciousness, enter into the body of *deva, manushya*, etc., and one is called *deva*, another is called *manushya*, etc. The *aatman * itself does not become of the form of the body. The *aatman * itself does not change the *svaroopa*, it is *eka svaroopa*. 



***Abheda vyaapinah abhedena vaayutva aakaarena vyaapinah |*** Without any difference, in the same form as *vaayu*, it is pervading everywhere. 



***Atra paramaatma shabdena aatmaa eva uchyate, \* Paramaatmaa iti cha api ukto   
dehe asmin purushah parah; \* Taih eva vigatah shuddhah paramaatmaa   
nigadyate, ityaadi darshanaat |*** The word *Paramaatman * is used here. The meaning of *Paramaatman * is *aatman * only here. Because of the context, and it is *aatma jnyaana * which is being taught. An example is given about how the *jeevaatman * existing in this body is told as *Paramaatman*. Another reference where *jeevaatman * is told by the name *Paramaatman * is given.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Uktam artham vivrunvan upasamharati eka svaroopa iti | ***Again explaining whatever was taught so far, he is concluding the teaching here. 



***Eka svaroopa bhedah - \* Tasya aatma paradeheshu sato api ekamayam hi yat |

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **difference as *deva, manushya*, etc., is meant here. The differences of the form of *deva, manushya*, etc., of the *jeevaatmans*, who are of the same nature, *jnyaana **aakaara*, is because of the karma, as told here. Though he is existing in his body and other bodies, he is of the same nature everywhere. He is fully made of consciousness. Because he is covered by the *karma*, external *karma*, his nature is covered. So, he is not realizing his nature. *Prajah * means *prakarshena jaayate*. The *baahya karma * is covering it. 



***Phala abhisandhi yuktam bhagavati asamarpitam cha baahya karma, aatmanah   
svaroopa bahirbhootam vaa, yathaa vakshyati \* Avidyaa karma sanjnyaa anyaa   
... tayaa tirohitatvaat cha shaktih kshetra samjnyitaa | Sarva bhooteshu   
bhoopaala taaratamyena vartate || iti |*** *Baahya karma* is that *karma * done with desire in the fruits, and that which is not surrendered into *Paramaatman*. One wants to enjoy oneself. He thinks that he is only the enjoyer of the fruits, that he is only doing the *karma*, and he has desire in the fruits. When one does such a *karma*, it is called *baahya karma*. It is outside *aatman's **svaroopa. Aatma svaroopa * is not like that. *Aatma svaroopa * is *bhagavat sheshabhoota*, that he cannot independently do anything; by nature, he is utterly subservient to *Paramaatman*, and he has to do all kinds of service to *Paramaatman * at every stage; this is his very nature. Whereas if one thinks that he is doing the various *karmaas*, does with a desire in fruits, thinking of himself as the enjoyer, this is *baahya karma*. In reality, the *pradhaana phali * is *Paramaatman * only for all the *karmaas*. Because of that wrong understanding and performing *karmaas * in that manner, this difference of *deva, manushya*, is coming. *Aatmaas * are all of the same nature, *jnyaana aakaaraas. Karma * is making them to get these kind of bodies, and experience the fruits. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * gives *pramaanaas*, which will come later. 



*Avidyaa * is also called *karma. Chetana * and *achetanaas * are the *shaktis * of *Paramaatman*, and *avidyaa * is also one *shakti*, called *karma*. Because he is covered by that, by which the *shakti * called *kshetrajnya * is covered by the *shakti * called *avidyaa*, called *karma*; in all the beings, there is a *pramaana * which says that *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes *sankocha vikaasa*. In our *siddhaanta*, it is well established that *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes *sankocha vikaasa; **samsaara * comes because it has become *sankuchita*. For this, there is a *pramaana * in *Vishnu Puraana*, which will come. In all beings, there are differences, various degrees. For those who have not much *sankocha*, they will be in *punya **janmaas*. For those who have very much contracted *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, they will be born as *pashus, pakshis, keeta, vruksha*, etc. This is the difference for the bodies they take. 



***Deva aadi bhedah cha ayam yugapat anekeshaam ekasya cha kaala bhedena   
apadhvaste aavarane - karma aavarane, sa deva aadi bhedo na bhavati | ***These differences seen in the bodies of *deva, manushya*, etc. - for many of them, when it gets destroyed, over a period of time, the *karma * which is covering, that *aavarana * will not be there any more. That cover will not be there. It can be a difference in time, or it can be the same time for many of them. *Moksha * has got a Page **264** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **beginning, *aadi*, but it does not have an end. For *karma, aadi * is not there, but *anta * is there. 



***Deva aadi bheda apadhvasta it cha paathah | Yathaa aaha shounakah \*   
Karminaam karmabhedena deva bhedaadayo yatah || Karmakshayaat   
asheshaanaam bhedaanaam samkshayah tatah || iti | ***Because of the difference in *karma*, various *karmaas * that the individual does, they take various births. When the *karmaas * get destroyed, all the differences will go. In their *svaroopa*, they will be *jnyaana eka aakaara*. And all the individual selves for whom the *karma * gets destroyed, they will get liberated. 



This is the nature of *jeevaatman * taught in all these *shlokaas*.
