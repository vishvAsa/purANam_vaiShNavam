The greatness of *Paataala loka * is told. There is also description of *Ananta * who is bearing the whole earth. We are studying the 5th *Adhyaaya*, we were studying the description of the lower worlds - *Atala, Vitala, Nitala, Gabhastimat, Mahaatala, Sutala * and *Paataala*. These are the seven worlds, and these are also *bhoga bhoomis*. Those who live there enjoy all kinds of pleasures and enjoyment, and it is much better than heaven; this is what *Naarada * was telling, after having seen these *lokaas*. Those endowed with that kind of *punya * to be in those *lokaas*, enjoy different kinds of food, music.
