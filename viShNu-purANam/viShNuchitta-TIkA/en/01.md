***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 1:*** ***Sri Soota uvaacha - *** ***Paraasharam munivaram kruta pourvaanhika kriyam |*** ***Maitrayah pari papraccha pranipatya abhivaadhya cha ||*** It is said that *Paraasharar * was only 30 years old, whereas Maitreya was 80 years old. Maitreya was also a *jnyaani*; he requested Paraasharar who had completed his *aanhika kriyaas*, and *pranipatya, abhivaadya*. This shows how one should approach an *aachaarya*. 



 [[10]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary*** ***Atha bhagavaan paraasharah sri maitreyaaya loka hitaartham sri   
vishnu puraanam praneshyan pranipaataadibhih upasannaaya sat   
shishyaaya sadaachaaravataa tat prushtena gurunaa sva dharma   
anusthaana aviruddhe manah prasaadakara samaye puraanam   
vyaakhyeyam iti shaastra darshanaat puraana prastaavakam tat   
prashnam nibadhnaati - paraasharam iti shlokena |*** In the pretext of teaching Sri Maitreya, Sri Paraashara has done this for *loka **hitaartha*, for everyone's good. When a *shishya * approaches an *aachaarya * in a proper way, the *aachaarya * has to teach, this is the *vidhi*. When should one approach an *aachaarya *- one should not obstruct the *anusthaana * of the *aachaarya; puraana * is to be told at that time. Maitreya asks a question. 



***Paraan baahya kudrushteen samyak pramaana   
tarkaih aashrunaati iti paraasharah, ... *** How Paraashara got that name; those who say that they are following the Vedaas but give wrong meanings to the Vedic mantraas; with proper *pramaanaas * and the logic for those *pramaanaas, * Paraashara wins over them. 



***... tam munivaram samyak jnyaanavantam kruta pourvaanhika kriyam   
bhagavat samaaraadhana aadinaa visheshato vimala manasam |*** Doing *poorvaanhika * is all *bhagavat aaraadhana * only, at that time, mind is very pure, and clear. 



***Pari papraccha - paritah papraccha, puraanaartham iti sheshah |*** He asked everything in detail. 



 [[11]] ***Kaartsnyena artha vishesha anabhiniveshena saamaanyato \* yanmayam   
ityaadi vakshyamaana prakaarena |*** The question does not ask everything that he wanted to know. This is going to be told later. 



***Atah prashna anuroopena prati vachanam api na kachit aagrahena   
krutam |*** Because of the question, the *prativachana * is not made due to some *aagraha*, force. This means that it is according to *shrutis * only. 



***Tena asya puraanasya laingaadivat na kachit pakshapaatitvam |*** There is no bias in the reply. 



In this introduction we saw the greatness of this work, the validity of this work as established by Sri Sudarshana Suri, and have just begun by doing this *mangala kaarya*. We pray to all our *aachaaryas * to grace us to take the study of this great work to completion. 



We studied the *first shloka. Soota pouraanika * in *Naimishaaranya * is supposed to have taught all the *puraanaas*. He is said to be *Romaharshana's * son in one place, and in another place is said to be *Romaharshana * himself. He is a *rishi*. 




***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 1:*** ***Sri Soota uvaacha - *** ***Paraasharam munivaram kruta pourvaanhika kriyam |*** ***Maitrayah pari papraccha pranipatya abhivaadhya cha ||***  [[12]] *Parashara*, the *muni shreshta*, having completed his *aanhika kriyaas - **Maitraya rishi * approached him by doing *namaskaara * and *abhivaadana *\(this is how a *shishya * is supposed to approach an *aachaarya*\), and asked to explain all the *puraana arthaas * in detail. 



*Paritah papraccha pari papraccha. * 



***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shlokaas 2, 3:*** ***Tvatto hi vedaadhyanam adheetam akhilam guro |*** ***Dharma shaastraani sarvaani tathaa angaani yathaa kramam ||*** 



***Tvat prasaadaat muni shreshta mama anyena akruta shramam |*** ***Vakshyanti sarva shaastreshu praayasho ye api vidvishah ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary*** ***Atha maitreyah chaturdasha vidyaa aabhooshita puraana adhigame   
trayodasha vidyaasthaana adhigama lakshanasya aatmano   
adhikaarasya tat prasaada labdhatva anuvaadena gurum stuvan   
puraana pravachane protsaahayati tvatto hi iti dvayena | *** By the two *shlokaas* starting with *tvattah*, among the fourteen *vidyaa **sthaanaas, Maitreya * is now eligible to study the thirteenth one which is *puraana*, 'I have studied all these through your grace', is requesting him to teach the *puraana*. 



*Angaani vedaah chatvaarah meemaamsaa nyaaya vistarah |* *Puraanam dharma shaastram cha vidyaah hi etaah chaturdashaah ||* 



 [[13]] ***Khilam prahatamanaamnaatam parishishtaakhyam shree sooktaadikam   
tat akhilam aamnaatam eva yathaa syaat tathaa vedaadhyanam   
adheetam adhigatam praaptam |*** Sri Engal Aalwaan gives two different ways by which it can be interpreted. Among the *Vedaas, Sri Sookta * is said to be *khila bhaaga*, as it does not have *svara * like *Purusha Sookta *\(though it is uttered using a particular *svara*\); I should be the one who has studied even the *khila **bhaaga*; I have done *veda adhyayana * under you in such a way. *Akhilam * means that even the *khila bhaaga * has been studied, without leaving any part. 



***Khila bhaagasya api adhyayanam tvatta eva praaptam iti arthah |*** I have studied even the *khila bhaagaas* from you only. 



***Yat vaa akhilam krutsnam yathaa kramam sva shaakhaa adhyayana   
poorvakam ruga aadi kramaan atikramena \* atah poorvam tu   
chandaamsi shukleshu niyatah pathet |*** The other meaning is: I have studied everything, all the Vedaas, first studying the *sva shaakhaa *\(the *shaakhaa * I belong to\) and the remaining. There is also a way in which Veda is supposed to be studied. In the *Shukla **paksha*, one has to study the *chandas*. 



***Krushna pakshe tathaa angaani maasaan vipro ardha panchamaan |*** In *Krishna paksha*, one has to study the *angaas * for five and a half months. The remaining part of the year is meant for practicing what has been learnt. 



***Ityaadi ukta krama anatikramena cha |***  [[14]] Following exactly the *krama * which is prescribed for *Veda adhyayana*, I have done the complete *Veda adhyayana * under you. Or, including the *khila **bhaagas, yathaa kramam*, I have studied everything including the *dharma **shaastraas*, as prescribed. 



***Tvat prasaadaat iti | Anye janaah na vidvishah te api sarva   
shaastreshu tvat prasaadaat akruta shramam maam na vakshyanti,   
kintu tvat prasaadaat eva kruta sarva shaastra parichayam maam   
samaavartanaanantaram vakshyanti | Anyena iti padachhede maam   
sarva shaastreshu tvat prasaadaat anyena upaayena akruta shramam   
vakshyanti, kintu tvat prasaadaadena eva kruta shramam vakshyanti iti   
arthah |*** 



*Maam anye na akruta shramam * and *Maam anyena akruta shramam *- these are the two *padachhedaas*. Those who do not like me, they will not say that I have not studied under you, through your grace. This means that *tvat **prasaadaat * is important here. After I have finished all the studies, they will tell that through your grace only I have studied all the *shaastraas*. 



In the second *padachheda*, not through any means other than your grace, I have studied all the *shaastraas*. 



There are certain *shishyaas* who study through many *aachaaryaas*, and there are those who study everything under one *aachaarya*. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 4:*** ***So aham icchaami dharmajnya shrotum tvatto yathaa jagat |*** ***Babhoova bhooyah cha yathaa mahaabhaaga bhavishyati ||*** Now, *Maitreya rishi* asks what he would like to know.  [[15]] 



***So aham iti | Ya evam veda aadi trayodasha vidyaa sthaana abhijnyah   
sah aham jagat janma aadi puraanaartham shrotum icchaami iti arthah   
| *** I who have studied the thirteen *vidyaa sthaanaas * like to listen from you how this world was created, how it is sustained, where does it go and merge during *pralaya*, the meanings of the *puraanaas*. 



***Anena brahma yajnya adhyayana artham veda uprabrahmanaartham   
cha puraanasya grahanaadou tat yogya traivarnikaanaam eva   
adhikaara ukto jnyeyah | *** What we can understand is that studying the *puraanaas*, is for two purposes - in order to use it in the *brahma yajnyaas*, and to understand the meanings of the *Vedaas*; here the *adhikaara * is for *traivarnikaas * only. 



***Paapa kshayaadi artham tu puraana shravanaadou stree shoodrayoh   
api adhikaarah | *** In order to get rid of the sins, and for all good, everybody has *adhikaara*. 



***Yathaa uktam bhavishyat puraane \* Adhyetavyam na cha anyena   
braahmana kshatriyayoh vinaa | Shrotavyam etat shoodrena na   
adhyetavyam kadaachana | *** Doing *adhyayana * and *shravana * are two different things. Doing *adhyayana * is in a proper way, with *svara * and *sookshma arthaas. Shravana * is for *paapa **kshaya*, just listening sitting with others. Others should not do *adhyayana*. Others should only listen. 



***Tasmaat shoodraih vinaa vipraah na shrotavyam kadaachana | Iti |   
Vilomajaanaam tu shravana aadou na adhikaarah | Soota aadeh tu *** [[16]] ***vilomajasya api puraana vachanam \* dharma esha tu sootasya sadbhih   
drushtah puraatanah \* ityaadi vachanaat aviruddham | *** *Vilomajaas * are those born to a woman of a higher caste and man of a lower caste. *Anuloma * is when father is of a higher caste and mother of a lower caste. *Vilomajaas * do not have *adhikaara * in *shravana * also, is what Sri Engal Aalwaan says. What the *soota * is telling is *dharma * only, is what is told by *sajjanaas*. There is a *Paadma Puraana vachana * here, where *Vyaasa **shishya soota * is teaching others in *Naimishaaranya*. This *vaakya * comes in *Paadma Puraana*. The *soota * told here is a *rishi*, and is different from the *vilomajaa * told earlier. This justifies why *soota pouraanika * is teaching this. 



***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shlokaas 5 to 10:*** ***Yanmayam cha jagat brahmanyataschaitah charaacharam |*** ***Leenam aaseet yathaa yatra layameshyati yatra cha ||*** 



***Yat pramaanaanaani bhootaani devaadeenaam cha sambhavam |*** ***Samudra parvataanaam cha samsthaanam cha yathaa bhuvah ||*** 



***Sooryaadeenaam cha samsthaanam pramaanam munisattama |*** ***Devaadeenaam tathaa vamshaan manoon manvantaraani cha ||*** 



***Kalpaan kalpa vibhaagaanscha chaaturyuga vikalpitaan |*** ***Kalpaantasya svaroopam cha yuga dharmaanscha krutsnashah ||*** 



***Devarshi paartivaanaam cha charitam yat mahaamune |***  [[17]] ***Veda shaakhaa pranayanam yathaavat vyaasa kartrukam ||*** 



***Dharmaanscha braahmanaadeenaam tathaa cha aashramavaasinaam |*** ***Shrotum icchaami aham sarvam tvatto vaashishtanandana ||*** 



***\* Yathaa jagat babhoova iti upakramya \* aashrama vaasinaam iti   
antena prashtavyaan arthaan aaha | *** Starting with *yathaa jagat babhoova* till *aashrama vaasinaam*, the first half of *Shloka * 10, whatever he wanted to known, *Maitreya rishi * has asked. 



***Atra bhagavataa bhaashyakaarena brahma svaroopa vishesha tat   
vibhooti bheda prakaaraah tat aaraadhana roopa phala visheshaah cha   
prushtaah iti prushtavyaartha visheshaah uktaah |*** Now, *Engal Aalwaan* quotes *Bhaashyakaarar*, some specific characteristics of *Brahma svaroopa * are being asked, along with various modes, *prakaaraas*, various benefits that we attain by worshipping the *Bhagavaan*. 



***Yathaa jagat ityaadi \* layameshyati yatra cha, ityantam brahma   
svaroopa vishesha prashnah | *** This is commented in Sri Bhaashya and Vedaartha Sangraha also. This is asking about the special characteristics, *vishesha * of *Brahma svaroopa*, essential nature of *Brahman*. 



***Yat pramaanaani ityaadi chaturyuga iti antam vibhooti bheda prakaara   
prashnaah | *** These *shlokaas * are asking about *vibhooti bheda prakaara*. 



 [[18]] ***Dharmaascha ityaadi ardhena tat aaraadhaana roopa phala vishesha   
prashnou prushtou | *** These *shlokaas* ask about *aaraadhana roopa * and *phala vishesha*. 



***Brahma svaroopasya yato vaa imaani ityaadi vaakya siddhatvaat tad   
vishesha eva atra prashtavya iti bhaashyakaarena brahma svaroopa   
vishesha prashnah iti uktam | *** If we say that Maitreya is asking about *Brahma svaroopa*, it will be a repetition as it is already established in the Brahma Sutraas itself, and in the Shrutis. Because it is already established in the *Shrutis*, there is no need to again ask it, but we can ask for certain specific additional characteristics about *Brahma svaroopa*. This is the reason why Bhaashyakaarar says that *Brahma svaroopa vishesha prashnaas * are asked here. 



***Nanu naaraayana anuvaaka aadibhih svaroopasya vishesho api   
nirdhaaritah | *** *Svaroopa vishesha* was also already established in *Naaraayana anuvaaka*. If so, why should it be said that *brahma svaroopa vishesha prashna * is being raised here? 



***Satyam, aneka anuvaaka viprakeernayoh saamaanya visheshayoh   
ekatra samaahrutya vachane hi vyaktih bhavati | *** It is true, but they are spread across many *anuvaakaas*; in one place it is told in generic terms, at other place, it is told in specific terms. In different places different terms are used - *jyoti, aakaasha, praana, yatah, tat, **brahma*, etc. In some places, it is told as *Naaraayana*. If everything is brought to one place and told, then only it becomes clear. 



***Etat eva hi puraana aadikrutyam veda upabrahmanam | ***  [[19]] This is the work of the *puraanaas * which do the *upabrahmanaaas*. 



***Yathaa babhoova yathaa bhavishyati iti sarva srushtishu kim eka   
prakaaraa srushtih uta aneka prakaaraa bhinna kramaah vaa iti   
prashnah | *** How did it happen, and how is it going to happen in future, in all the *srushtis*, how was it done, and in future how is it going to be done; is it the same way it is done in all the *srushtis*, or is it done in different ways at different times? 



***Atra utpatti layayoh prushtatvaat sthiti prashnah api abhipretah sthiti   
samyamakartaa iti prativachana darshanaat |*** *Sthiti prashna* is not specifically asked here; about how does it exist, sustain? This has to be understood. This is because of the answer given to this question as *sthiti samyama kartaasau*. 



***Yanmayam iti | Yatah cha etat charaacharam iti nimitta upaadaanayoh   
prushtatvaat yanmayam iti anena srushtyaadi karma bhootam jagat   
kim aatmakam iti prushtam | *** The meaning of *yanmayam * is to be understood clearly - from which are all these movables and immovables born, created - this is about *nimitta * and *upaadaana kaarana*. 



For every effect, there are three types of causes - *upaadaana **kaarana *\(material cause\), *nimitta kaarana *\(efficient / intelligent cause\) and *sahakaari kaarana *\(instrumental cause\). For making a pot, mud is the *upaadaana kaarana*, the potter is the *nimitta kaarana*; both *upaadaana **kaarana * and *nimitta kaarana * are required in every work that we see in the world. If *kaarya * has to happen, there have to be these *kaaranaas*. Those two are asked here - *yatah cha*, including both *upaadaana * and *nimitta * [[20]] *kaaranaas*. What is the *upaadaana kaarana * for this world? What is the *nimitta kaarana * for this world? Here, the word *karma * means the effect, what is created, the object of creation which is *jagat*. What is the *jagat * made of - is it without any *aatman*, does it exist independently by itself, or is it controlled by *Paramaatman * as the *antaryaami*, this is the question asked here. 



***Tasya cha uttaram jagat cha sah iti | Idam taadaatmyam antaryaami   
roopena aatmatayaa avasthaana krutam na tu vastu aikya krutam, ... *** The answer given here is ' *Jagat cha sah*', He is only the *jagat*, the world. *Taadaatmyam * means oneness, identity. This means that *Bhagavaan * is existing as *antaryaami*, inner controller of everything; He controls everything in the form of an *antaryaami*; it is not by the identity of two objects. It is not that *jagat * and *Brahman * merge together and become one. 



*Sarvam niyantrutayaa aapnoti iti aatmaa. * 



***... yanmayam iti prashnasya uttaratvaat jagat cha sah iti   
saamaanaadhikaranyasya | *** There are two words *jagat * and *sah - jagat * is the world which is created and *sah * is *Paramaatman*. They are told in concomitant coordination, *saamaanaadhikaranya*. The answer given is 'He is the world', means, 'Is He different from the world?' or 'Is He one with the world?'; it is *saamaanaadhikaranya*, which is ' *Bhinna pravrutti nimittaanaam **shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih saamaanaadhikaranyam*'; both words jagat and * sah * in the same *vibhakti, prathama vibhakti eka vachana *- are they the same, or are they qualifying the same object, is what we have to understand; the meaning here is that *Paramaatman * is *jagat antaryaami*. The *chara achara aatmaka prapancha * and *Paramaatman * are not identical; but *Paramaatman * who is the creator of the world, the *jagat kaarana*, and *Paramaatman * who is the *antaryaami * of the *jagat*, the identity is  [[21]] between these two. This is how the *saamaanaadhikaranya * has to be understood. When we say that *Devadatta * is handsome, handsomeness is one the the qualities of *Devadatta*. Identity is between *Devadatta * who is qualified by that quality, and *Devadatta *- there is identity between them; and not between the quality of handsomeness and *Devadatta*. 



***Yanmayam iti atra mayat na vikaaraarthah; pruthak prashna   
vaiyyarthyaat | *** There is a *pratyaya * in *vyaakarana * called *mayat*; this *mayat pratyaya * is used in three different senses - *svaartha, vikaaraartha * and *praachuryaartha. **Svaartha * means that it represents that itself; *vikaaraartha * shows the modification of that; *praachuryaartha * means abundance of that. We see this clearly in *annamaya, praanamaya*, etc.; *annamaya * is *vikaaraartha*, where the *vikaara * of *anna * is *deha; praanamaya * is in *svaartha, **praanamaya * is *praana; aanandamaya * is *praachuryaartha*, abundance of *aananda; jnyaanamaya * is *praachuryaartha*, abundance of *jnyaana*; Here, the sense in which the *mayat pratyaya * is used is discussed here. Here, if *mayat * is used in *vikaaraartha*, there is no need to ask *yatah etat **charaacharam*, etc. - these questions would not have been required at all. 



***Na api praanamaya aadivat svaarthikah; jagat cha sa iti uttara   
anupapatteh | *** It is also not in *svaartha*, like it comes in *praanamaya*. If it had been in *svaartha, brahmamayam * means Brahman only, and *jagat cha sah * would not have been the right answer for this. 



***Tadaa hi vishnuh eva iti uttaram abhavishyat |*** If it had been *svaartha*, the answer would have been Vishnu only. This was not the answer given by *Paraasharar*; the answer was *jagat cha sah*. 



 [[22]] ***Atah praachuryaartha eva |*** The usage is in *praachuryaartha*, abundance. 



***Krutsnam jagat tad aatmakatayaa tat prachurameva |*** All this world is having *Paramaatman * as the *aatman*, and so it has abundance of Brahman. Abundance of Brahman, which is *aatman * of everything, *chara, achara * in this world, is what is meant by *yanmayam*. 



***Tasmaat yanmayam iti asya prativachanam jagat cha sah iti   
saamaanaadhikaranyam shareera aatma bhaava nibandhanam |*** From this, what we can conclude is that ' *yanmayam*' is the question, and ' *jagat cha sah*' is the answer; the *saamaanaadhikaranya * is because of *shareera aatma bhaava nibandhanam*. This is the greatest contribution of *Bhaashyakaarar * who established the *shareera shareeri bhaava*, which is a *pradhaana pratitantra*, unique to our *siddhaanta*. 



Just as we exist in our body, we have *shareera * which has hands, legs, head, etc., and the *aatman * is inside, controlling everything; *shareera * is dependent on the *aatman, shareera * is supported by the *aatman*, and the *shareera * is meant for the purposes of the *aatman, aatman * is the controller; the relation between *shareera * and *aatman * is of three types - \(i\) *shareera * is *aadheya, aatman * is *aadhaara*, \(ii\) *shareera * is *niyaamya*, and *aatman * is *niyaamaka*, \(iii\) *shareera * is *shesha*, and *aatman * is *sheshi*. These are the three - *aadheya - aadhaara, niyaamya - niyaamaka, shesha - **sheshi*. If these three relationships exist all the time, they are said to be *shareera aatma bhaava * or *shareera shareeri bhaava*. The *saamaanaadhikaranya * here is *shareera aatma bhaava nibandhanam*; which means that *jagat * is the *shareera * for *Paramaatman * who is the *aatman*, and *sah * represent *Paramaatman * who is the creator of this world. *Paramaatman * who is qualified by *jagat * [[23]] *kaaranatva * and *Paramaatman * who is having *jagat * as His *shareera*, there is identity between these two. 



***Anyathaa baadhaayaam saamaanaadhikaranyaashrayanena nirvishesha   
vastu pratipaadana paratve shaastrasya abhyupagamyamaane sarvaani   
etaanai prashna prativachanaani na sangaccheran, tat vivaranaroopam   
cha krutsnam shaastram |*** If it is not understood like that, if we take the identity that *jagat * is also Brahman, then *jagat * would not exist, it would become *baadhita, jagat * gets stultified, and Brahman only remains; then this would establish Brahman as not having any attributes, if one accepts like that, the questions asked by *Maitreyar * and answers given by *Paraashara * would not make any sense, the *Vishnu Puraana * which explaining the meanings of these questions and answers, will be of no use. 



***Tat pakshe hi prapancha bhramasya kim adhisthaanam, nirvishesha   
jnyaana maatram iti prashna prativachane syaataam |*** If that had been the case that there is only identity, and attribute-less Brahman, then what should have been the questions and answers - the question should have been 'What is the locus of this delusion of the form of *prapancha*, this appearance of the form of this world', the answer should have been *nirvishesha jnyaana maatram*; but this is not the answer given here and not the question raised here. 



***Jagat cha sah iti jagat brahmanoh eka dravyatvena   
saamaanaadhikaranye cha brahmanah kalyaana gunaaikataanatvam   
heya pratyaneekatvam cha baadhyeta; sarva ashubha aaspadam cha   
brahma bhavet |*** The second opinion is that: If we say that Brahman is not *nirvishesha*, that Brahman is *jagat* itself, that Brahman only exists in all these forms, they are the same material, because the world is filled with inconsistencies and  [[24]] impurities, then all the qualities of Brahman, being an abode to only auspicious qualities, being opposed to anything that is defiling, would not be there; Brahman would then be attributes to all the impurities; so it cannot be taken like that. 



***Tasmaat aatma shareera bhaava eva idam saamaanaadhikaranyam   
mukhyam iti vakshyaamah |*** This is the *siddhaanta*, that the *saamaanaadhikaranya jagat cha sah*, is *aatma shareera bhaava*, this is how it should be understood. 



Another objection is addressed here. ***Na cha yatah cha iti yasya kaarana maatra vaachitve api yanmayam iti   
asya upaadaana kaarana vishayatvaat gobalivardhanyaanena yata iti   
nimitta kaarana param iti vaachyam; ... *** We cannot say like this - that *yatah ch* a is the *nimitta kaarana*, and *yanmayam * as the *upaadaana kaarana*, 



***... tasya agatika vishayatvaat atra mayatah praachuryaarthatvena   
gatyantara upapaadanaat cha |*** because, by accepting the *praachuryaartha* for *mayat * here, we are able to explain clearly that it is *shareera aatma shareera nibandhana*; if there was no other way to explain that, then we could have taken *nimitta **kaarana * in *yatah * and *upaadaana kaarana * in *yanmayam*; but that is not so, as we are able to reasonably explain *saamaanaadhikaranya * as *shareera aatma **bhaava*. 



***Svaarthikatve yat jagat iti prashnasya vishnuh jagat iti uttare kaa   
anupapattih iti chet; tadaa hi baadhaayaam saamaanaadhikaranyam   
abhihitam syaat |***  [[25]] Suppose we take *svaarthika*, for the question 'What is this *jagat*', the answer 'Vishnu only is *jagat*', then also it is reasonable, isn't it? is the objection. then also it would mean *baadha*, because *jagat * would get stultified. 



***Tatah cha sthaanuh eva na purusha itivat vishnureva na jagat iti arthah   
syaat |*** This is like asking a question when seeing a pole - is it a person standing there, or is it a pole? When we go nearby, we say clearly that it is a pillar and not a person. 



***Tathaa jagat vishnuh iti jagat brahmanoh aikya upadeshasya na jagat   
vishnuh iti vaiyadhikaranyam iti arthah syaat iti shruti viruddhaa   
ashruta baadha kalpanaa syaat |*** In that case it is not like ' *Sthaanureva na purushah*', it will become like ' *Vishnureva na jagat*'; just as *sthaanu * and *purusha * are told in *vaiyadhikaranya*, not in *saamaanaadhikaranya*, and this will lead to *shruti **viruddha*, it will be against what is told in the *shrutis*. Stultifying the world as not true is not told in the *shrutis*. 



***Arthavatve siddhyati mayatah svaarthakatvena vaiyarthyam cha   
ayuktam |*** In *mayat pratyaya*, if you are not able to explain the meaning well by taking *svaartha*, whereas you are able to explain the meaning well by taking *praachuryaartha*, then we should take *praachuryaartha*. We should not take *svaartha*, which will lead to *vaiyarthya*, we will not be able to explain properly. 



***Leenam aaseet yathaa yatra yena kramena yatra leenam sa kaaranam |*** It is explained in what order everything goes and merges during *pralaya*.  [[26]] We studied the first six *shlokaas so far*. *Maitreyar * requested *Paraashara **Muni * to teach him the cause of the universe. The word *yanmayam * was commented upon in detail. This is due to *shareera aatma bhaava **nibandhana*, this is the same way explained in Sri Bhaashya by Bhaashyakaarar. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 6:*** ***Yat pramaanaanaani bhootaani devaadeenaam cha sambhavam |*** ***Samudra parvataanaam cha samsthaanam cha yathaa bhuvah ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yat pramaanaani iti | Pruthivyaadeeni yat pramaanaani iti mahaa   
bhootaadeenaam iyattaa prashnah, jagatah pramiti saadhana   
prashnascha |*** What is the measure of *pruthivi, aapas, tejas*, etc., to know about the origin and end of this world, the origin of *devaas * and others; the oceans and hills, where were they existing, and how were they supported. All these things I would like to know, is what *Maitreyar * is asking. 



*Iyatta * means measure, expanse. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 7:*** ***Sooryaadeenaam cha samsthaanam pramaanam munisattama |*** ***Devaadeenaam tathaa vamshaan manoon manvantaraani cha ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Sooryaadeenaam iti | Manvantaraani manoonaam kaalaah |*** *Manvantaraani* means the time period when *Manus * existed. The sun and others - what is the *aadhaara * for all this? 



***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shlokaas 8, 9:*** ***Kalpaan kalpa vibhaagaanscha chaaturyuga vikalpitaan |*** ***Kalpaantasya svaroopam cha yuga dharmaanscha krutsnashah ||***

vaa |*** *Kalpaan* means limited to, or extending up to the life of Brahma. The *chaturyugaas * keep repeating again and again, *kalpaas * are divided into four *yugaas * which keep repeating again and again. *Kalpa * means *Padma, **Koorma*, etc, which are told as *brahma divasaas*, they are all parts of the *mahaa kalpa*, they are all days of Brahma. *Kalpa anta * means *pralaya*, the end of the *kalpa*. How the *Vedaas * are going to be divided. The *devarshis*, kings, their story; how the *Veda shaakhaas * were all formed, whose *pravartana * was done by *Vyaasa*, how *Vyaasa * divided the *Vedaas*. All these things I would like to know. 



***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shlokaas 10, 11:*** ***Dharmaanscha braahmanaadeenaam tathaa cha aashramavaasinaam |*** ***Shrotum icchaami aham sarvam tvatto vaasishtanandana ||*** 



***Brahman prasaada pravanam kurushva mayi maanasam |*** ***Yena aham etat jaaneeyaam tvat prasaadaat mahaa mune ||***

ityaadinaa |*** All the *dharmaas*, the *varna dharmaas * and *aashrama dharmaas*, I would like to know. I would like to learn about all these things. *Maitreyar * addresses *Paraashara * as *Vaasishta Nandana, **Vasishtha's * son is *Vaasishta*, *Shakti; Vaasishtha's * son is *Vaasishta Nandana*. The moment *Maitreyar * says that 'I would like to listen to all these things from you, O son of *Shakti*, who is son of *Vasishtha', Paraasharar * was very pleased and started telling the story. *Jnyaana * one can attain only with the grace of *aachaaryaas, Paraasharar * was reminded about how he received a boon from *Vasistha*, he became very pleased, and in order that *Maitreyar * and others get the *shraddhe * required in the meanings which are going to be taught, he starts telling that story. One should have *shraddhe * in what is going to be taught, means that it is *praamaanika*, 



 [[28]] *Maitreyar * says that 'By your grace only I will know about all these things; let your mind be pleased towards me; grace me with all these details; let your grace flow towards me'. 



***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shlokaas 12, 13, 14, 15:*** ***Sri Paraashara uvaacha -*** ***Saadhu maitreya dharmajnya smaaritah asmi puraatanam |*** ***Pituh pitaa me bhagavaan vasishtho yat uvaacha ha ||*** *Sri Paraashara * said - O *Maitreya*, I am very pleased, one who knows the *dharmaas*; I was reminded about the old story. My father's father *Vasishtha*, whatever he said, I am reminded of that. I will tell you that. 



***Vishvaamitra prayuktena rakshasaa bhakshitah puraa |*** ***Shrutah taatah tatah krodho maitreya abhoot mama atulah ||*** 



***Tato aham rakshasaam satram vinaashaaya samaarabham |*** ***Bhasmeebhootaah cha shatashah tasmin satre nischaacharaah ||*** 



***Tatah sanksheeyamaaneshu teshu rakshassu asheshatah |*** ***Maam uvaacha mahaa bhaago vasishtho mat pitaamahah ||*** 



This story is told in *Mahaabhaarata * also. *Vasishta's * son *Shakti * is crossing over a bridge, and there is place for only one person to cross. On the other side, *Kalmaaashapaada*, a king will be coming. Both of them want the other person to leave way, and both do not want to yield. *Kalmaaashapaada * gets angry and hit *Shakti * with his whip; and *Shakti * gets very angry, and curses him to become a *nara maamsa bhakshaka*, a man who eats human flesh. *Vishwamitra * comes there, and makes the king get the curse immediately, and *Kalmaaashapaada * eats *Shakti*. Then *Vasishtha * loses all his sons, and being without any progeny, he decides to commit suicide. He is unable to commit suicide, because of his powers as a *rishi*; wherever he goes, an ocean, etc. nothing happens to him. He comes back, and suddenly listens to Veda being chanted, and seeks where it is coming from. He comes to know that the *Veda paaraayana * is coming from the womb of *Shakti's * wife, *Adrushyanti*. He becomes happy that *Adrushyanti * is pregnant, and his progeny is going to continue. *Adrushyanti * gives birth to *Paraasharar; Paraasharar * thinks that *Vasishta * is his father, and calls him so. *Adrushyanti * says that it is not so, and that his father was eaten up. Because of this, *Paraasharar * becomes very angry. Then *Paraasharar * started a *Satra yaaga*, for destruction of all the *raakshasaas*. Hundreds  [[29]] of *raakshasaas * will come and fall into that, and will be burnt into ashes. At the time the *raakshasaas * are getting destroyed, *Vasishta * came and told *Paraashara * these words. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 16:*** ***Alam atyanta kopena taata manyum imam jahi |*** ***Raakshasaa naaparaadhyanti pituh te vihitam hi tat ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Alam iti | Manyum satram |*** *Vasishta * says - 'Enough of this anger, stop this *satra. Raakshaaas * have not done any *aparaadha*, because your father's fate was that'. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 17:*** ***Moodhaanaam eva bhavati krodho jnyaanavataam kutah |*** ***Hanyate taata kah kena yatah sva kruta bhuk pumaan ||*** Anger comes to only *moodhaas*, the ignorant ones. For the knowledgeable ones, this should not happen. Who is killed by whom? Every person experiences the fruits of ones own doings. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 18:*** ***Sanchitasya api mahataa vatsa kleshena maanavaih |*** ***Yasasah tapasah cha eva krodho naashakarah parah ||*** They have all accumulated *punya paapaas* of their own doing over a long period of time, from beginningless time, and they have to experience all of this. Fame and *tapas *- anger destroys all that. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 19:*** ***Svarga apavarga vyaasedhakaaranam paramarshayah |*** ***Varjayanti sadaa krodham taata maa tat vasho bhava ||*** Anger prevents *svarga * and *apavarga \(moksha\)*. That is why *rishis * control their anger. Don't get into the sway of anger. You have to control the anger. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yasastapasoh naashe svarga apavarga saadhana dharma jnyaana   
pratibandho jaayate iti aaha svarga iti |*** The cause of *svarga * and *apavarga*, which is *jnyaana * and *dharma *- anger obstructs that. *Krodha * prevents someone from following dharma, and *jnyaana * does not arise. 





 [[30]] ***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 20:*** ***Alam nishaacharaih dagdhaih deenaih anapakaaribhih |*** ***Satram te viramatu etat kshamaa saaraa hi saadhavah ||*** They have not done any *apakaara * to you, and they are helpless. They are getting burnt here - all the *nishaacharaas*. Stop this *satra yaaga*. This is a beautiful statement - *kshamaa saaraa hi saadhavaah *- the power of *saadhus * is *kshamaa * itself, forbearance. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 21:*** ***Evam taatena tena aham anuneeto mahaatmanaa |*** ***Upasamhrutavaan satram sadhyah tat vaakya gouravaat ||*** Immediately, in order to respect *Vasishta's * words, I stopped that *Satra*, being told like that by the *Mahaatma Vasistha*. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 22:*** ***Tatah preetah sa bhagavaan vasishto munisattamah |*** ***Sampraaptah cha tadaa tatra pulastyo brahmanah sutah ||*** *Vasishta * was very pleased, at the same time, Brahma's son *Pulastya * also came there. *Pulastya * is of the *Raakshasa vamsha*. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 23:*** ***Pitaamahena dattaarghyah kruta aasana parigrahah |*** ***Maam uvaacha mahaa bhaago maitreya pulahaagrajah ||*** Immediately, *Vasishta * gives *argha, paada, aasana * to *Pulastya*, and makes him seated. *Pulastya*, the elder brother of *Pulaha*, told me thus. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 24:*** ***Pulastya uvaacha - *** ***Vaire mahati yat vaakyaat guroh adya aashritaa kshamaa |*** ***Tvayaa tasmaat samaastaani bhavaan shaastraani vetsyati ||*** When you had great enmity against the *raakshasaas*, in order to listen to the words of *Vasishta*, when you have now resorted to *kshamaa*, you will attain the knowledge of all the *shaastraas*. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 25:*** ***Santateh na mamocchedah kruddhena api yatah krutah |*** ***Tvayaa tasmaat mahaa bhaaga dadaami anyam mahaa varam ||*** My *santati * was not broken by you even when you were very angry against all the *raakshasaas*. Because of this, I will give you one more great boon. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 26:***  [[31]] ***Puraana samhitaa kartaa bhavaan vatsa bhavishyati |*** ***Devataa paramaarthyam cha yathaavat vetsyathe bhavaan ||*** You will also become the *kartaa * of *puraana samhitaa*. You will know as it is the reality about who is the supreme god. Because of this itself, this *puraana * is *praamaanika*. It is because of this that *Paraasharar * was given the boon. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Puraaneti | Samhitaa tulyatvaat samhitaa tasyaah kartaa | Yathaavat

You will know without any doubt, in a proper way, not knowing something differently or wrongly. You will know the supreme deity along with the *vibhooti*, glories, *vigraha*, attributes, the acts, the various qualities - you will know all this without any doubt. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 27:*** ***Pravrutte cha nivrutte cha karmani astamalaa matih |*** ***Mat prasaadaat asandigdhaa tava vatsa bhavishyati ||*** Your mind will very clearly understand the *pravrutti * and *nivrutti karmaas*, due to my grace. You will have no doubt. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pravrutta iti | Pravruttam kaamyam karma | Nivruttam nishkaamam   
jnyaana poorvakam | Astamalaa ajnyaana viparyaasa rahitaa |*** *Astamalaa matih* means not getting the wrong understanding. *Nivrutti **karma * is *nishkaama karma * with the knowledge of the *aatman*, and not desiring any fruits. *Pravrutti karmaas * are *kaamya karmaas*. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 28:*** ***Tatah cha praaha bhagavaan vasistho me pitaamahah |*** ***Pulastyena yat uktam te sarvam etat bhavishyati ||*** When one *rishi * gives a *vara*, another *rishi * is telling ' *Tathaastu*' - 'Let it happen like that'. *Vasishta * said ' *Tathaastu*'. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 29:*** ***Iti poorvam vasishthena pulastyena cha dheemataa |*** ***Yat uktam tat smrutim yaati tvat prashnaat akhilam mama ||*** I am now reminded of all that what *Vasistha * and *Pulastya * said, by your question.  [[32]] 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 30:*** ***So aham vadaami ashesham te maitreya pariprucchate |*** ***Puraana samhitaam samyak taam nibodha yathaa tatham ||*** I, who was given this boon by none other than *Vasishtar * and *Pulastyar*, I have perceived it as they exist directly, with the grace of the *aachaaryaas*, I am telling to you, who are asking this question. This *puraana **samhitaa * which is equivalent to *samhitaa*, I am telling you as it is, properly, listen to this. 





***Sri Vishnu Puraana - Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 31:*** ***Vishnoh sakaashaat udbhootam jagat tatra eva cha sthitam |*** ***Sthiti samyama kartaa asou jagato asya jagat cha sah ||*** This *shloka * summarizes the *puraana arthaas*. This world was created from Vishnu, and this world is existing in Him only. He is the Creator, He is responsible for sustenance also, He only is responsible for ultimately taking it to Himself, controlling it. He is only the world.

I have perceived all this directly'. The question that Maitreya desired to know is: what is that *vastu* which is the cause of this universe, what is the relation between the creator of this universe, and this universe itself? These are the main things that *Maitreyar * desired to know. With this, the main answer for the question is summarized here, the essence of the *puraana*, which is answered with ' *Vishnoh sakaashaat*'. 



***Tathaa hi - mumukshoh kshetrajnyasya \* yato vaa imaani jaayante \* tat

He has to know the cause of this universe, this is told in *Shruti * itself. From which all these are born, in which all these are existing, and they all go and merge into it - as told in *Taittiriya Upanishad*. The mantra in *Shvetaashvatara Upanishad*, as told in the *Saankhya * and *yoga shaastraas*, all these are *aatma pramaanaani*, they teach about the *aatman, **Naaraayana * is told as the Supreme Deity, everything goes and culminates there, this is the *shaastra * which is told. In *Atharva Shikhopanishad*, it is said ' *Kaaranam tu dhyeyam*'; for the question 'Who should be meditated upon', the answer is that the *jagat kaarana vastu * has to be meditated upon, is told. Because it is taught like this in the *Shrutis*, the *mumukshu **kshetrajnya * has to know the *jagat kaarana vishesha*. One has to also know the relation between the *jagat kaarana vastu * and the *jagat*. 



***Tatra hi shareera shareeri bhaava paryaaye niyaamya niyaamakatva

iti nischetavyam |*** After understanding the *jagat kaarana vastu*, and the relation between the *jagat kaarana vastu * and the *jagat*, one has to conclude that the difference between *jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman* is real and in essential nature itself. Between *jagat * and *jagat kaarana*, there is *shareera shareeri **bhaava. Jagat * is the *shareera*, and *jagat kaarana vastu, Paramaatman * is the *shareeri. Shareera * is with the three relations - *aadhaara aadheya **bhaava, niyaamaka niyaamya bhaava, shesha sheshi bhaava. **Shareera * is *aadheya, niyaamya*, and *shesha bhoota*, to *shareeri*, who is *aadhaara, niyaamaka, sheshi*. Another way of telling is *niyaamya **niyaamakatva lakshana *- controlled and the Controller. If we know this distinction, we will know the difference between *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman. * This is told in *Shrutis*, as He is the impeller. Meditating that *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman * are different, one gets released from this *samsaara*. Two unborn entities, who are *nityaas*, one is *eesha*, ruler, and another is *aneesha*, the ruled; one is the knower, and compared to Him, the other is *ajnya*, ignorant. There is *aatma bahutva*, they are all *nityaas aatmaas*. They are *chetanaas*, they have *jnyaana **aashrayatva*. For all these *chetanaas * who are many and eternal, there is One Eternal *Chetana*, who bestows all their desires; He is the bestower of all the desires. He is the ruler, controller. All these establish the difference  [[34]] between * jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman*. There is difference in *svaroopa*, essential nature itself. This is how it is to be clearly decided. 



***Anyathaa tasya upaadhikatve avidyaa parikalpitatve vaa tayoh   
niyaamya niyaamaka bhaavo na syaat |*** If it not so, if we do not understand it like this, there are two ways to understand this \(i\) *jeeva bhaava * is due to some *upaadhi*, limiting adjunct, then Brahman itself will get *jeeva bhaava*, then *jeeva * is actually not there, \(ii\) it is due to *avidyaa * that *jeeva * is being imagined, Brahman gets covered by *avidyaa*, ignorance, and thinks that he is *jeeva*; there is no possibility of *niyaamya niyaamaka bhaava * in both these cases. 



However, what *shrutis * say is that the *niyaamya niyaamakatva lakshana*, they are distinct and different from each other by essential nature itself. This is told with an example, the same example given by *Bhaashyakaarar * in Sri Bhaashya. 



***Na hi ghata aakaasho mahaa aakaashena niyaamyate |*** *Mahaa aakaasha* is the space existing everywhere. *Ghata aakaasha * is the space existing inside a pot. We make such a distinction because of the limiting adjunct of the pot. If the pot is broken, the *ghata aakaasha * merges into the *mahaa aakaasha*. In this case, if we are talking of *mahaakaasha * and *ghataakaasha * as being different due to *upaadhi * of *ghata*, where is the question of *mahaakaasha * controlling the *ghataakaasha*; the *niyaamya niyaamaka bhaava * does not exist at all. 



***Niyamanam hi vyaapya avasthaanam |*** *Niyamana*, controlling is existing with pervasion. Controller has to pervade what is controlled. 



***Na hi ghata aakaashe mahaa aakaashah tishthati |*** We don't say that the outside *aakaasha, mahaakaasha * exists inside the *ghataakaasha * also, pervading the *ghataakaasha*. So, due to *upaadhi*, we cannot say that they are different in essential nature. 



***Ghate ghata aakaasho mahaa aakaashascha iti aakaasha dvayoh   
upalabdhih syaat |*** If *mahaakaasha * had been controlling *ghataakaasha * by pervasion, then we would have said that there is both *ghataakaasha * and *mahaakaasha * inside the pot. But we do not say like that. So, the difference between *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman * cannot be due to *upaadhi*, it has to  [[35]] be due to *svaroopa * only; when *niyaamya niyaamaka bhaava * is told very clearly in the *Shruti*, these clearly establish that it is not *oupaadhika*. 



***Avidyaa parikalpitasya na niyamanam sambhavati |*** When we imagine something due to *avidyaa*, there is no question of controlling at all. 



***Na sthaanou parikalpitah chorah kena api niyamyate |*** When we see a pillar and imagine it to be a thief, we cannot control it as there is no thief there. In this case, due to ignorance, if we are imagining a thief in a pillar, it cannot be controlled. 



***Kim cha bhedasya oupaadhikatve kalpitatve vaa brahma vidyayaa tat   
tvam asi iti vaakyaartha jnyaanena vaa upaadhi avidyayoh naashaat   
tat kruta bhedo jeeva shabdaartho nashyet iti mokshasya   
apurushaarthatvaat saadhane na kaschit pravarteta | *** Nobody will put any effort to understand this kind of relationship between *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman*, where it is imagined due to ignorance, or it is due to limiting adjunct; and by the knowledge of the *vaakya 'Tat tvam asi*', with this statement, *upaadhi * and *avidyaa * will go off; then the *jeeva shabda artha * itself will get destroyed, because there is no more *jeeva * there, there is no *purushaartha * in such a *moksha*, then who will undertake *saadhana*, put any effort for attaining such a *moksha*? Nobody will. 



***Jeevasya anityatve shruti virodhah cha |*** If *jeeva * is going to be stultified, that there is no more *jeeva*, there is no meaning of the *shabda * itself, as *jeeva * does not exist. 



Whereas *Shruti * says that *jeeva * is *nitya*, eternal. 



***Jeeva parayoh sambandhe niyaamya niyantrutva roope mokshasya   
purushaarthataa siddhyati |*** If the relationship between *jeeva * and *Paramaatman * is *niyaamya niyantrutva **sambandha*, then only *moksha * has some meaning, and it becomes *purushaartha*. 



Meaning of *shesha * is *paragata atishaya aadhaanecchayaa upaadeyatvameva **yasya svarupam sah sheshah itarah sheshi. * *Shesha * has to cause *atishaya * to the *sheshi*. When we know that we are subservient to *Bhagavaan*, that our *svaroopa * is to do *atishaya * to *Bhagavaan*, which culminates in *kainkarya*,  [[36]] then it is a *purushaartha*, which we attain according to our real nature. Then *moksha * will be a *purushaartha, purushaih arthyate*, which is sought after by *purushaas*, because it is according to their essential nature. 



***Sa hi sambandhah shesha sheshitva aatmaa |*** This is the relationship of master and subservient one or slave. 



Thus, the *sambandha * is *shesha sheshitva roopa*. The *sambandha * between *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman * is of the form of *shesha* and *sheshi. Jeevaatman * is subservient to *Paramaatman*, who is the *sheshi*, the master. The relationship is of this form \(master - slave\); by their essential nature, *jeevaatmans * are all subservient to *Paramaatman, **jeevaatmans * are real and many; there is a multitude of *jeevaatmans*; it is not due to some limiting adjunct, *upaadhi*, or *avidyaa. **Jeevaatman * and *Brahman * are different and distinct in their nature, though they are inseparably associated with each other. This is how *shrutis * are propounding these realities. All the *upaayaas * which are prescribed in the *shrutis * to escape from this *samsaara*, all of this will become meaningful. Otherwise, nobody will put any effort to get rid of this *samsaara*, if everything is like a dream, and is not real; it will be against what is told in the *shrutis*. The *sambandha * is *shesha sheshitva aatmaa*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's commentary \(continued\)*** 

***Shesha bhootasya jeevasya sheshinam param prati shrooyamaanaa   
samaahitaa eva hi svaroopa anuroopaa kainkarya sampattih, saa eva   
khalu mokshasya kaashthaa |*** Because of this relationship of master and subservient one, the nature of the subservient *jeevaatman*, is according to the nature of subservience itself, it culminates in *kainkarya*; the *shesha * has to bring *atishaya* to *sheshi*; he has to do all kinds of service to the master, this is the essential nature of *jeevaatman*; the service at all times, according to the needs of the master, is in accordance to the very nature of *jeevaatman*. This is ultimate nature of liberation, *moksha*. 



It is sometimes said that doing service to someone is not good, and nobody enjoys it. How can doing service to *Paramaatman * be the ultimate form of  [[37]] liberation? Is it not some kind of bondage? Who wants to be a slave? These kinds of questions are raised and examined in detail in *Vedaartha **Sangraha * and *Sri Bhaashya * by *Bhaashyakaarar*. It is said that in this world, we do not enjoy subservience to others, as it is not according to our nature; it is due to the karma. Whereas in our real nature, we are subservient to only *Paramaatman*; this is the nature of *jeevaatman*; so according to this nature, it will be most enjoyable. If it is against the nature, then only it will not be enjoyable. The kind of subservience we experience in this world is due to karma, and this is why it is not very enjoyable and filled with grief. Whereas if it is according to the nature, it will be most enjoyable. This is *svaroopa anuroopa*. This is said to be the ultimate form of liberation. 



*Sri Engal Aalwaan * explains the *shloka * word by word according to the questions asked by *Maitreyar*. ***Atra jagat kaarana vishesha prashnasya uttaram vishnoh sakaashaat iti   
|*** What is the cause of this universe, the answer being given is that ' *Vishnoh **sakaashaat*'. 



***Sakaashat kaashah - prakaasho jnyaanam |*** *Kaasha * means brilliance or lustre, it means *jnyaanam*. 



***\* Sa aikshata lokaannu srujaa iti, \* tat aikshata bahu syaam \* ityaadi   
ukta sankalpa roopa prakaasha sahitaat iti arthah |*** *Aikshata * means 'He willed', to create the world; *Paramaatman * willed that He become many, this willing is *jnyaana*, this is what is told as *kaasha*; with the *sankalpa roopa jnyaana*, is the meaning. 



 [[38]] ***Athavaa sakaasha shabdah sva roopa vachanah, aachaaryasya   
sakaashaat itiyaadivat |*** Or, it can be taken as *svaroopa * itself; as in from the *aachaarya*, he received something, it is referring to the nature of *svaroopa * itself. 



Both can be told as *Paramaatman * is *nimitta * and *upaadaana kaarana. **Paramaatman's sankalpa * is the *nimitta kaarana*, and *Paramaatman * Himself is the *upaadaana kaarana*. From Vishnu Himself, everything is created; this can be told with respect to *svaroopa * also - this refers to *upaadaana **kaarana*. When it is told with respect to *sankalpa roopa jnyaana*, He is the *nimitta kaarana*. 



***Yathaa babhoova, yathaa bhavishyati iti anayoh api idam eva uttaram   
|*** How was it existing earlier, how is it now, and how is it going to be in future - for all this, the answer is the same that it is from *Paramaatman's * willing that everything is created, or from *Paramaatman * Himself everything is created; this is the answer given. 



***Bhagavatah poorva sarga prakaara krama smruti roopa sankalpena hi   
uttara sarga pravaahah, \* dhaataa yathaa poorvam akalpayat \* iti   
shruteh, \* yatha ruthushu rutulingaani \* iti smruteh cha |*** The way and order in which the earlier creation happened, *Bhagavaan * remembers that and wills to create the world in the same order and same way that it existed earlier; creation and *pralaya * keep happening like a flood, again and again; through His *sankalpa*, He created in the same way. It is told in *Vishnu Puraana* itself, in Chapter 5 of *Amsha * 1 that ' *Yathaa rutushu rutulingaani ... *' the various seasons, coming one after the other in various forms, the same signs are seen again and again; in the same way, in every *yuga*, all the things are getting created in the same way.  [[39]] 



***Leenam aaseet ityaadeh uttaram tatra eva cha sthitam iti |*** The question asked is 'Where did it go and merge', and the answer is that it merged into Vishnu Himself and existed as a part of Vishnu Himself. 



***Upaadaane kaaryasya samsthitih hi layah |*** *Laya * means merging. *Kaarya * is effect and *kaarana * is the cause. When the *kaarya * merges in the *kaarana*, this is called *laya*. The effect goes and merges, and exists in the cause. The effect does not get destroyed, but goes and merges in the cause and exists in the cause. 



When we say that a pot is destroyed, it has got and merged in its cause, which is mud. 



***Sthiti samyama kartaa iti |*** He causes sustenance, and controls it. 



***Sthitih ubhaya vidhaa, \* yena jaataani jeevanti \* iti uktaa praanana   
lakshanaa antaraatmatayaa sthitih ekaa, loka paala soorya soma aadi   
roopena bahih poshakatva aadi roopaa sthitih aparaa |*** There are two types of existence which we see - \(i\) if *Paramaatman* is not existing as the *antaraatman*, the *jeevaatman * cannot live at all; He makes the *jeevaatman * enter into *achetana*, the *deha, indriya*, etc., and He exists as the *antaraatman * of the *jeevaatman*, and *jeevaatman * can live only because of *Paramaatman * existing as *antaraatman*; the beings are all breathing, existing, living because *Paramaatman * exists as *antaraatman; **Paramaatman's * existence as *antaraatman * to *jeevaatman*, and making him exist as *manushya, mruga, pakshi*, etc., is one form of *sthiti*, \(ii\) for the beings to live, there has to be sunlight, moon, etc., the beings get  [[40]] externally nurtured and grow from all these things; if sunlight is not there, things will not grow; this is another way in which *Paramaatman * is the cause of existence as He makes every being live through sub, moon, etc. 



***Agni antaka aadi roopena samhaarah samyamah |*** *Samyama* is taking everything into Himself, destruction, is in two ways \(i\) by Agni, fire which destroys everything, *Paramaatman * exists as *antaraatman * of *Agni*, and \(ii\) *Yama*, death. He only does *samhaara * being their inner self. 



***Tatra bahih sthitih sthiti samyamayoh kartaa iti uktaa, praanana   
lakshanaa sthitih jagat cha sah iti uktaa |*** In the *shloka*, the word *sthiti * refers to *bahih sthiti*, external; *jagat cha **sah * means that He is existing as the inner self of everything in this world. There is nothing which does not have *Paramaatman * as the inner self. Because He is existing as the inner self, all beings are living. 



***Idam eva yanmayam iti asya jagat brahmanoh sambandha prakaara   
vishesha prashnasya api uttaram |*** The question answered was ' *Yanmayama cha jagat brahman*', for that, the answer is also this only. Between *jagat * and *Brahman*, the relationship is also answered in this way. 



***Yat vaa shruti smruti aadibhih niyamanam samyamah, tatra eva cha   
sthitam, sthiti samyamayoh kartaa iti chakaarena svaroopa   
prashnottaram eva |*** *Samyama * can also be told as controlling, through *shruti * and *smrutis*. How does *Paramaatman * control everything in this world? He has given us the *shaastra*, the *shrutis*. He first does the *upadesha * to *Chaturmukha * [[41]] *Brahma*, from whom all the others get it. Various *rishis*, due to their *poorva **karma samskaara*, get the powers to do the *saakshaatkaara * of the *shrutis*, and explain the meanings of the *shrutis * in *smrutis*. Through the *shrutis * and *smrutis*, all the *vidhi * and *nishedha * is told. This is nothing but *Bhagavaan's aajnyaa *- what one should do, and one should not do. This can also be told as *samyama*. The ' *cha' kaara * also says the *svaroopa **prashnottara*, about where everything got merged into - it merged into *Paramaatman * only. He is the *upaadaana kaarana*, everything emerges from Him and goes and merges into Him. Nothing is destroyed completely, but the *kaarya * goes and exists in the *kaarana*. 



*Paramaatman * is the creator of everything, He exists as the *antaraatman * of everything, He is ultimately responsible for the sustenance and withdrawal of everything, and also controlling of everything, He is existing as the inner self of everything, He is the material cause and intelligent cause, He creates all these worlds again and again in the same way as done in the previous creation just like the seasons. *Paramaatman's sankalpa roopa jnyaana * is told as *sakaashaat*. Or the inseparable association, *apruthaksiddha sambandha*, is also in the *svaroopa * itself. *Jagat * is inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*. 



There are two types of *sthitis*, He exists as *antaraatman*, inner self, and is responsible for the living of all the beings; He is also responsible through external entities like sun, moon, to nurture and make all the beings live and grow. In these two ways, He controls the existence and sustenance of all things. He does *samhaara * through *Agni, Antaka*. He controls through *shruti, **smruti*. Everything is existing in Him, and goes and merges in Him, and emerges during *srushti*. This is all told very briefly in one *shloka, shloka * 31. 



With this the first *adhyaaya * comes to a close. 



 [[42]] ***Shreeh ityaadi iti | Sarva puraanaam aadhi bhoote brahma khaanda   
aakhye mahaa puraana udhrutaayaam paaraasharya samhitaayaam iti   
prathamodhyaayah iti anvayah |*** The commentary says that this was taken from *Brahmaanda Puraana*, which was the first *puraana * of all the *puraanaas*, this *Paaraasharya samhitaa * is also taken from there.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 1, Shloka 32:*** ***Mitraaputra vacho nishamya sakalam smrutvaa aatmanah tat varam *** ***Satram cha eva nivaaritam sa sumahaabhaago bhavottaaranam |*** ***Krutvaa vaishnavam uttamam munivaram maitreyam adhyaapayat*** ***Tattva artha pratipaadanam pravadataam sarvaarthadam   
shrunvataam ||*** This summarizes this first chapter. Hearing the words of *Maitreyar*, when he was requesting Paraasharar to teach him everything, he remembered all the previous events, the stopping of the *Satra*, which was started to destroy all the *raakshasaas*, the *vara * he got from *Pulastya*; through this *uttama **Vaishnava Puraana*, which is the means for everyone to get rid of *samsaara*, he taught it to the *muni shrestha Maitreyar*; it has got all the *tattva **arthaas*, and for listeners it gives all kinds of *Purushaarthaas*, benefits. 



***Iti shree vishnu puraane prathame amshe prathamo adhyaayah ||***

chitteeye prathame amshe prathamo adhyaayah |*** 



 [[43]] The second chapter starts where Sage *Paraasharar* starts explaining the nature of *Paramaatman*, in a wonderful way. How it is different and distinct from everything, is told.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 1:*** ***Sri Paraashara uvaacha -*** ***Avikaaraaya shuddhaaya nityaaya paramaatmane |*** ***Sadaika roopa roopaaya vishnave sarva jishnave ||*** He does not have any *vikaara*, He is immutable, does not undergo any change. 



*Paramaatman's svaroopa * is explained wonderfully in the first seven *shlokaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tat evam sankshepatah uktaanaam prati vachanaanaam vivaranatayaa   
avataaryamaanasya puraanasya aarambham avikaaraaya ityaadibhih   
saptabhih \(navabhih\) shlokaih puraana pratipaadya svaabhimata   
devataa namaskaara poorvakam pratijaaneete |*** In the beginning, *Paraasharar * offers obeisance to his *svaabhimata devataa*, the *Paramaatman*, who is his favourite God, and one who is established in the *Puraanaas, Mahaa Vishnu*, whose nature is going to be established in this *puraana*, about whom he is going to teach in detail. Briefly *Paraasharar * told the answers to *Maitreyar's * questions in one *shloka *\( *shloka * 31, of *Amsha * 1, Chapter 1\). Now he is going to explain that in detail. This entire *puraana * is going to explain in detail the answer given by *Paraasharar * very briefly in one *shloka*. He starts the *puraana * with  [[44]] these seven *shlokaas*, starting with *Avikaaraaya*, thereby offering *namaskaara * to his favourite *devataa * and one who is established in this *puraana*. 



***Tatra kaaranatva abhidhaanatah prasaktam vikaaritvam nirasyati -   
avikaaraaya iti |*** The moment something is told to be a cause of something, the cause undergoes a change - we see like this in the world. All causes are assumed to be undergoing some modification. Is *Paramaatman * also like that, is the first question we get. This is refuted in the very first *shloka *- that which is told to be having *kaaranatva*, the change that ensues is being negated. He does not have any vikaara, that is HIS essential nature. 



***Anena achetanaat vyaavruttih |*** By this, *Paramaatman * is different and distinct from the inert. Because all the *achetanaas * undergo change all the time, in *svaroopa * itself. 



*Achetanaa paraarthaa saa nithyaa satata vikriyaa. Achetana * is also eternal, but undergoes change in essential nature all the time. It is *achetanaa*, not *jnyaana aashraya*. It is inert, and does not have knowership. It is *paraarthaa*, exists for something else. *Chetana * uses it for body, *indriyaas*, etc. It is eternal, in *avyakta * form. It is also a reality in our *siddhaanta*, along with *chit * and *eeshvara*. 



Whereas *Paramaatman * is *avikaari*, so *Paramaatman * is distinct and different from *achetana*. 



***\* Na jaayate mriyate vaa ityaadi shruteh kshetrajnyasya api samaanam   
avikaaritvam iti tat vyaavruttim aaha - shuddhaaya iti |***  [[45]] Now, if *Paramaatman * is different from *achetana*, by telling as *avikaari*, even *chetana * is also *avikaari*, as it is told that he is not born, or does not die, does not undergo any change; *jeevaatman * in his essential nature is *jnyaana svaroopa. Kshetrajnya * who is *jeevaatman * is also equally *avikaari*. How is *Paramaatman * different from *jeevaatman? Paramaatman * is *shuddha*. 



***Shuddhih klesha karma aadi raahityam; \* ashuddhaah te samastaastu iti   
hi vakshyate |*** *Jeevaatman * has got *karma, ajnyaana*. These do not exist for *Paramaatman *- this is told as *shuddhaaya*. In *Vishnu Puraana * itself, it is going to be told that *deva, manushya * are *karma yonayah *- born due to karma, and so are all said to be *ashuddha*; they undergo grief, sorrow, sufferings. *Paramaatman * is said to be *shuddha*. 



***Eedrushi shuddhih muktasya api asti iti tat vvyaavruttim aaha -   
nityaaya iti | *** By *shuddhaaya, Paramaatman * is different and distinct from *jeevaatman*, because *jeevaatmans * are all *ashuddhaas*; they are *baddha jeevaas * referred to here. So, *Paramaatman * is different from *baddha jeevaas*. This kind of *shuddhi * is there for *muktaas * also, because they have escaped from *samsaara*, liberated from *samsaara*; the *muktaas * do not have *klesha, **karma*. In order to say that *Paramaatman * is different from *muktaas*, the next word *nityaaya * is told. *Paramaatman * is eternally *shuddha. **Muktaas * were at one point of time *baddhaas * in *samsaara*; and after that got liberated; they are not eternally *shuddhaas*. 



***Shuddhatva akaarena nityaaya |*** *Paramaatman * is eternally *shuddha*. 



 [[46]] ***Avikaaritva shuddhatva nitya shuddhatva aadeeni nitya soorinaam api   
saadhaaranaani iti ata aaha - paramaatmana iti |*** There is one more category of *aatmans*, who are *nityaas*. They are *avikaari, **shuddha*, and also *nitya shuddha*, because they are called *nitya sooris*, eternally not connected with *samsaara*. So, *avikaaraaya, shuddhaaya, **nityaaya *- apply to even *nitya sooris*, so how is *Paramaatman * different. The word *Paramaatman * itself shows that He is different from *nitya sooris * also. 



***Paro yasmaat naasti sah paramah, aparaadheenah; niyantrutayaa   
sarvasya vyaapanaat aatmaa, nitya soorayah tena paravantah |*** There is no one who is superior to *Paramaatman*. He is not under the control of anyone else, whereas *nityaas * are under the control of *Paramaatman*. He pervades everything, being the controller, this is why He is said to be *aatmaa. Nitya sooris * are also controlled by Him. he does not have any other controller. 



***Atah pada chatushtayena pradhaanaadi achetana brahma sanaka aadi   
bhaavanaa yukta kshetrajnya mukta nitya sooribhyoh vyaavruttam   
parama svaroopam shodhitam |*** By these four words - *avikaaraaya, shuddhaaya, nityaaya, paramaatmane *- what is established is that *Paramaatma svaroopa * is different and distinct from \(i\) *pradhaana * and all such *achetanaas \(kaala, mahat, ahamkaara*, etc.\), \(ii\) all the *jeevaatmans \(Brahma, Sanaka*, etc.\) who are all *bhaavanaa **yukta*\*, \(iii\) *mukta*, the liberated souls, \(iv\) *nitya sooris*, the eternal liberated ones. The nature of *Paramaatman * as different and distinct from all these, is established by these four words. 



\* There are three kinds of *bhaavana*, they are *bhaavanaa traya - karma **bhaavanaa, brahma bhaavanaa * and *ubhaya bhaavanaa. Brahmabhaavanaa* is of the form of *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana, karma bhaavana* is *karma anushthaana*. *Sanaka* and other have *brahmabhaavanaa*  [[47]] *Hiranyagarbha* and others have *ubhaya bhaavana* \(some times *karma* and sometimes *brahma bhaavanaa*\). All other *devas* and *manushyas* тАУ have *karma bhaavanaa*. The explanation regarding *mumukshus* \( *manushyas* or *devas*\) тАУ is that they are also having *karma bhaavanaa* only as they think that тАШ *upaasane*тАЩ is being done by them only \( *svakeeyata buddhi*\). Hence it is not considered *brahma bhaavana* \(because *Vishnu **Puraana shlokas* are clearly stating such\). We will come across this in 6th A *msha*. 



***Atha jnyaana shakti aadivat asaadhaaranam tadvat eva sarva   
vilakshanam sva anuroopam jyotirmayam \* aaditya varnam \*   
hiranmayah purusho drushyate \* vidyutah purushaadadhi \* iti upanishat   
siddham svaroopam aaha - sadaika roopa roopaaya iti | *** *Sadaika roopa roopaaya ... * - this part of the *shloka * is establishing the nature of *Paramaatman * which is established in the Upanishads as *jyotirmayam*, incomparable brilliance, lustre - *Aaditya varnam tamasah parastaat *- compared to *Aaditya, Hiranmayah purusho drushyate *- brilliance is compared to that of gold, *Vidyutah purushaadadhi *- lightning, etc - which is befitting His own *svaroopa*, different and distinct from everything else other than Himself, which is extraordinary or unique to *Paramaatman*, just like *jnyaana shakti*, etc. - this form of *Paramaatman * is told as *sadaika roopa **roopaaya*. 



***Prathamo roopa shabdah svabhaava vaachee |*** The first *roopa shabda * is telling about *svabhaava*. Always of the same form, immutable. This is told as *saidaika roopa*. 



***Athavaa sadaika roopam tulya prakaaram, heya pratyaneekatayaa   
kalyaana ekataanatatayaa cha svaroopa tulyam |*** Or *sadaika roopa* can also be interpreted as always of same form of nature - which is opposed to anything defiling, and abode to only all auspicious qualities. In whatever form He exists, these two are are always present. 



 [[48]] ***Dviteeyo roopa shabdo vigraha vaachee |*** The second *roopa shabda* is telling that He has eternal *shubhaashraya, divya **mangala vigraha*. He has a form, an eternal auspicious form, immutable all the time. 



***Atha sarva vyaapti lakshanam aishwaram gunam khyaapayan   
visheshyam nirdishati vishnave iti |*** The word *vishnave* is telling about His quality, of the form of ruling everything, pervading everything, *Bhagavaan * pervading everything controls everything from inside and outside. 



*Aishwara * is about ruling everything. *Eeshitavya * is what is ruled. He is not like the things of this world who can only rule externally. 



*Vishu vyaaptou * is the *dhaatu*. 



***Chit achit vyaaptyaa prasaktam dosham pariharati sarva jishnave iti |*** The moment *vishnave * is said, that He is pervading and controlling everything, all the defects of that *chetana * and *achetana *- do they ensue to *Paramaatman*? This is negated by the word *sarva jishnave*. He is untainted by any of the defects. 



***Jayo hi parasya sva vashe sthaapanam |*** Winning means establishing whatever is won over, establishing it under ones control. Controlling everything, winning over everything is also *svaabhaavika*. 



 [[49]] ***Taaccheelya pratyayena vyaapti jayou svaabhaavikou iti darshayati |*** The word Vishnu, according to *vyaakarana * is told as *Taaccheelya*, means one who pervades everything, it is the nature itself. This becomes *svaabhaavika*. 



Pervading everything and controlling everything - both these are natural to *Paramaatman*. 



*Shloka * 1 is a very important *shloka*, which establishes *Paramaatman's * unique nature and attributes that He is different and distinct from everything else; He controls everything pervading from inside - *antarvyaapti*. He has a *divya **mangala vigraha*, which is most lustrous, unchanging all the time. He is of the nature of being opposed to anything defiling, being abode to only auspicious qualities. This establishes the nature of Brahman in the most wonderful way.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 7:*** ***Vishnum grasishnum vishvasya sthitou sarge tathaa prabhum |*** ***Pranamya jagataam eesham ajam aksharam avyayam ||*** 



*Paramaatman's svaroopa* is taught up to these seven *shlokaas*. 



***Question***: Why *Bhagavaan * wanted to create? *Answer*: This is also asked in the *Brahma Sutras*. The answer given by *Baadaraayana * is ***Lokavat tu leelaa kaivalyam***. It is His sport. Someone has grief, someone has happiness. Someone is enjoying, someone is suffering. Someone has knowledge, someone has ignorance. Why should *Paramaatman* create all this? It is said to be His sport. He is impartial. He does not have *vaishamya * and *nairghrunya*. He does not want someone to suffer. He does not have impartiality or cruelty. The suffering happens because of *chetana's karma*; they have to experience the results of that; if they do not experience, there will be *dosha * of partiality on the part  [[51]] of *Paramaatman*. A king, if he does not punish a criminal, will become partial; he has to enforce the law. *Leelaa * is sport for Him, and is ultimately *dayaa*, because He wants *jeevaatmans * to liberate themselves from *samsaara*. He gives them the mind, thinking power, *kriyaa shakti, chit **shakti*, shows the *aachaaryaas*, teaches the *shaastra*, makes one to go in the right way, and they have to uplift themselves; if they don't do, they have to suffer the *karma*. 



We had studied the *Shloka * 1, of *Amsha * 1, Chapter 2, where the *Paramaatma **svaroopa * is established wonderfully, where He is different and distinct from everything else - *achetana, baddha, mukta * and *nitya*. Being the *antaryaami * of everything, He is the inner controller. He has a wonderful divine auspicious form, which is also eternal, and He pervades everything and rules over everything. All of this was established with various *Shruti * and *Smruti pramaanaas*. 



Continuing further, *Bhagavat svaroopa * is established again, in various ways. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 2:*** ***Namo hiranya garbhaaya haraye shankaraaya cha |*** ***Vaasudevaaya taaraaya sarga sthiti antakaarine ||*** I offer *pramaanams* to *Hiranya Garbha, Hari * and *Shankara*, and also *Vaasudeva*, who makes everyone cross over *samsaara * and is the cause of creation, sustenance and *pralaya *\(dissolution\). 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary*** While *Bhagavat svaroopa * is being established, everything is directed towards *Bhagavaan*. But here, we see *namaskaarams * being done to *Hiranya * [[52]] *Garbha * and *Shankara*. What is its meaning? How is *Bhagavat svaroopa* known from this? This is explained in the *vyaakhyaana*. ***Brahma shivayoh tat vibhootitvam aaha - namo hiranyagarbhaaya iti |*** The aspect that *Chaturmukha Brahma * and *Rudra * are also *vibhooti * of *Paramaatman, \(vibhooti * means *aishwarya, **Bhagavaan's * glory, being ruled over by him\) - this is told by *Namo Hiranya **Garbhaaya iti*. 



***Sva avataara chaturmukha rudra roopena hi srushti aadi kartrutvam |*** *Brahma, Vishnu* and *Maheshwara*, who are the three *devataas*, responsible for *srushti, sthiti * and *pralaya; sva avataara * is *Bhagavaan's * own *avataara*, along with *Brahma * and *Rudra *- in these three forms; He being the *antaryaami * of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, makes him do the creation; being the *antaryaami * of *Rudra*, He does dissolution in the form of *Rudra*; and *Vishnu * is His own *avataara*, He Himself stays as *Hari*; in the forms of *Chaturmukha Brahma * and *Rudra*, He does *srushti * and *pralaya * being their *antaryaami*. 



***Taaraaya - samsaara uttaarakaaya, moksha pradaaya |*** One who makes everyone cross over *samsaara*, and in getting liberated from *samsaara*. 



***Vaasudevaaya - vaasudeva roopena moksha pradatvam |*** *Vaasudeva * is *Para Vaasudeva; Bhagavaan * is present as *Para **Vaasudeva * in *Parama Padam; moksha pradatva* is told for Him. 



***Hari shabde satyapi vaasudeva shabdo hareh avataaratva   
jnyaapanaarthah |***  [[53]] When *Hari * is already told, why is *Vaasudeva * being told again; *Hari * is *avataara * of *Paramaatman * only; *Para Vaasudeva * Himself incarnates or manifests as *Hari*, to give equal status to *Brahma * and *Shiva * in *srushti * and *pralaya*, as they are His own *vibhootis*; He only has given them the powers to do the powers; He stays with them to give them the status. 



***\* Tam eva viditvaa atimrutyumeti naanyah panthaa vidyate ayanaaya,   
\* maam eva ye prapadyante maayaam etaam taranti te \(Bhagavad   
Geetha\), \* samsaara paaram param eepsamaanaih aaraadhaneeyo hari   
eka eva, \* ... *** The *pramaanaas * establish that *Vaasudeva * is only the one who can bestow *moksha, atimrutyumeti * is told as *mrutyum atyeti*; meditating on *Paramaatman * only, doing *upaasana * on *Paramaatman * only, one can cross over *mrutyu, samsaara*, there is no other way to cross over this; in order to cross over this *prakruti*, one has to surrender only unto *Paramaatman*; for those who want to reach the other end of *samsaara*, only *Hari * is to be worshipped. 



***... Brahmaanam shitikantham cha yaah cha anyaa devataah smrutaah |   
Pratibuddhaa na sevante yasmaat parimitam phalam | ... *** Those who are desirous of attaining *moksha*, they are called *pratibuddhaas*; they do not worship or surrender unto *Chaturmukha Brahma, Rudra * or any other *devataa * who is told like *Varuna*, Indra, etc. The reason is that the benefits gained by worshipping those deities is very limited as they are all in the *prakruti mandala * only; and whatever they can give is limited to their capacities, as they are *kshetrajnyaas * only; none of them can give *moksha*. 



***\* Antavat tu phalam teshaam \* ityaadibhih bhagavata eva moksha   
pradatvam uktam |***  [[54]] Those who worship other deities, their fruits have and end, their benefits end at some point of time; it is not *ananta phala*, but *antavat phala*; only *Bhagavaan * can bestow fruits which are *ananta*; all these *pramaanaas * establish that *moksha pradatva * is only for *Bhagavaan*. 



***Atra hiranyagarbha aadivat hareh na vibhootitvam, \* na hi paalana   
samarthyam rute sarveshvaram harim \* ityaadinaa tasya   
sarveshvaratvasya uktatvaat |*** Here the *vibhootitva * is only for *Hiranya Garbha * and *Shiva*, and not for *Hari*; other than *Hari*, there is no other *Sarveshvara*, no one else can rule over or control, that capacity is not there for everyone else; He has been told to be *Sarveshvara*; He is not part of the *vibhootis*. 



*Shloka * 2 establishes the offering of *pranaamams * to *Bhagavaan*, who is in the form of *Hari * Himself, and His *vibhootis*, who are *Chaturmukha **Brahma * and *Rudra*, He being their *antaryaami*, does all their works, and *Vaasudeva * who bestows *moksha*, and is the cause of *srushti, **sthiti * and *laya*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 3:*** ***Eka aneka svaroopaaya sthoola sookshma aatmane namah |*** ***Avyakta vyakta roopaaya vishnave mukti hetave ||*** He is one also, and many also. He is also subtle, and expressed in the gross form. I offer *pranaamams * to Him. He is also in the unmanifested state and manifest state. He is the cause of *moksha, Vishnu*, who is the all pervading *Paramaatman*. I offer my obeisance. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Avyakta vyaktayoh api tat roopatvam aaha eka aneka iti | ***  [[55]] *Avyakta * is the unmanifest, which are in the *sookshma roopa*, subtle form; and *vyakta * is the manifest, which are in the *sthoola roopa*. 



This is how the *anvaya * has to be done. ***Kaarana dashaayaam eka sookshma avyaktatva aadeeni kaarya   
dashaayaam aneka sthoola vyaktatva aadeeni vishnave tat vyaapine |*** In this, *eka, sookshma * and *avyakta *\(He is One, subtle and unmanifest\) have to be grouped together and are in the causal state, and *aneka, sthoola, **vyakta *\(He becomes many, in the gross form, and manifest\) have to be grouped together and are in the state of effect. One who pervades in the causal state and state of effect, is *Vishnu*. 



***Ubhaya avastha prakruteh mukti hetave sva vasha vartitvaat tat mukti   
hetave |*** He is the cause of *mukti * in both the states, because everything is under His control, and everything acts being under His control only.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 4:*** ***Sarga sthiti vinaashaanaam jagato yo jaganmayah |*** ***Moola bhooto namah tasmai vishnave paramaatmane ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Achit prasangaat kaala roopatvam aaha - sarga sthiti iti |*** Here, *kaala svaroopa * is being told, *Bhagavaan * being of the *svaroopa * of *kaala*. 



 [[56]] ***Jagat sarga aadi moola bhooto hi kaalah, \* na kaalena vinaa srushti   
nishpaadakrut bhavet \* ityaadeh |*** *Kaala* is the cause of *srushti, sthiti, laya*. Everything is referred with respect to time. Time is always known with respect to objects. An object comes into existence at some time, it stays for some time, undergoes change, and gets destroyed at some point of time. For all these, *kaala* is said to be the root cause. Without *kaala*, *Brahma * cannot create, because creation is done at a particular time. 



***Jaganmayah - unmesha nimesha kalaa unmaana soorya gamana aadinaa   
padaartha avacchedaka svaroopah |*** Here, *Bhagavat svaroopa * is told in the form of *kaala * itself. Time can be felt in aspects such as opening the eyes, closing the eyes, divisions of time like *kalaa muhoortha kaashthaa paksha maasa samvatsara*, a particular measure called *unmaana*, movement of the Sun in the morning, afternoon, evening - everything is bound by time, and *Paramaatman * only is told as that *svaroopa*. He binds everything with respect to time. He is only responsible for the rising of the Sun at a particular time. 



***Paramaatmane - akaala vashyaaya |*** *Paramaatman* is not controlled by time. *Kaala * is under the control of *Paramaatman*. 



***\* Kaalah pachati bhootaani sarvaani eva sahaatmanaa | Kaalah pakvo   
yamanveti yastam veda sa vedavit ||*** Time cooks everybody. *Kaala* itself will get cooked by *Paramaatman*. Whoever knows this is said to be *Vedavit*. 



 [[57]] ***\* Kaala muhoortaadi mayah cha kaalo na yad vibhooteh parinaama   
hetuh \* ityaadi |*** *Paramaatman's nitya vibhooti * does not undergo any change. *Kaala * is having divisions of *kalaa, muhoortha, kaashtha*, etc., and is not the cause of *parinaama * of *Paramaatman's vibhooti*. In *Paramapada*, *kaala * does not control anything; everything is eternal there, and there is no change; *kaala * exists but does not control anything in *Paramapada*. In *prakruti mandala, kaala * controls everything. Even *Brahma's * time is limited by a particular number of *kalpaas*. 



*Shloka * 4 tells about the *kaala svaroopatva * of *Paramaatman*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 5:*** ***Aadhaara bhootam vishvasya api aneeyaamsam aneeyasaam |*** ***Pranamya sarva bhootastham achyutam purushottamam ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Samasthi kshetrajnya roopatvam aaha - aadhaara bhootam iti |*** The collectivity of all the *chetanaas, * souls, sentients - during *pralaya*, everything gets merged, and all *chetanaas * will be together - the *Paramaatman * who has all of this as His body, He has control over everything, and is the support of everything. 



***Vishvasya prakruti parinaamasya jeeva karma nimittatvena tat   
shareeratayaa tat aadhaaratvam |*** The *prakruti parinaama * is due to the *jeeva karmaas. Prakruti * is the *shareera * for *jeevaas*, and because of *jeeva karmaas, prakruti * gets  [[58]] modified into *deha, indriyaas*, etc., and is under the control of *jeevaatman*. 



***\* Bhrutamaatraah prajnyaa maatraasu arpitaah \(Koushitaki Upanishad\)   
\* yayaa idam dhaaryate jagat \* ityaadi |*** *Pancha bhootaas * are controlled by *jeevaatman*, and *jeevaatman * is controlled by *praana shabda nirdishta Paramaatman; prakruti * is supported by *jeevaatman, jeevaatman * is supported by *Paramaatman*. 



***Aneeyaamsam aneeyasaam prakruteh ati sookshma avasthaa   
visheshaanaam api vyaaptyaa tato api sookshmataram |*** *Jeevaatmans * are also *sookshma * compared to *prakruti*, and they pervade the *prakruti*. 



***\* Avyaktam akshare leeyate \* ityaadi |*** *Avyakta * is *prakruti * in unmanifest state, it merges with *akshara*, which is the *samashti jeevaatmans*. This goes and merges into *Paramaatman*. 



***Sarva bhootastham sarva bhooteshu aatmatayaa avasthitam |*** Existing as the inner self in all the *bhootaas*. 



***Achyutam - tat vikaara rahitam |*** *Prakruti vikaaraas* do not affect the *chetanaas*. 



***Evam roopa samashti purusha shareeram purushottamam pranamya   
kathayaami iti anvayah |***  [[59]] The *anvaya* is: All these are ultimately pertaining to *Paramaatma **svaroopa * only, the *Paramaatman * who has all these as the *shareera*, the *achetana * as *shareera, kaala * as *shareera, samashti **kshetrajnyaas * as *shareera*, and who controls all these being the inner controller of these, who pervades everything. One who has this kind of *samashti kshetrajnyaas * as His body, to one who is *aadheya, **niyaamya * and *shesha bhoota*; I do *pranaama * to that *Purushottama*, and tell this. 



This is directly told with *saamaanaadhikaranya*, that *sarva bhootastham **purushottamam, aneeyaamsam aneeyasaam purushottamam *- the *Purushottama * who has all these things as the body. 



***Yat vaa sarva bhootastham sarva aatmasu sthitam |*** Or *sarva bhootastham * can be taken as one who is existing in all the *aatmaas * also. Or it can be told as *jeevaatmans * who are existing in all the bodies, and *Paramaatman*, who is the controller of all these *jeevaatmans*. 



***Achyutam jeeva gata jnyaana sankocha aadi rahitam |*** When *sarva bhootastham * is taken as *Paramaatman * directly, *Achyutam * is taken as one who is *vikaara rahita*; the ups and downs in *dharma bhoota **jnyaana * is not present in *Paramaatman*. When taken with respect to *samashti kshetrajnyaas, Achyutam * is taken as *kshetrjnyaas * who do not have the *vikaara * of *prakruti * which undergoes modifications in its *svaroopa. **Jeevaatmans * undergo *jnyaana sankocha * in their *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, due to their *karma*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 6:***  [[60]] ***Jnyaana svaroopam atyanta nirmalam paramaarthatah |*** ***Tam eva artha svaroopena bhraanti darshanatah sthitam ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vyashti roopam aaha - jnyaana svaroopam iti |*** After telling about the *samashti roopa * of *Paramaatman*, which is the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, now the *vyashti roopa * is being told. *Vyashti **roopa * is that which is manifested, in the gross state. *Samashti * is the unmanifested state, *avyakta*, before the *pancheekarana*. After *pancheekarana*, whatever happens is called *vyashti srushti *- here name and form divisions happen, *naama roopa vibhaaga*. 



***Vastu vruttiyaa aparicchinna anukoola jnyaanaika svaroopam |*** It is not limited by any object, and it has got unlimited *anukoola*, and *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*. 



***Atyanta nirmalam sarvathaa mala roopa dukha ajnyaana aadi rahitam;   
tam eva bhraanti darshanatah anaatmani aatma vijnyaanaat artha   
svaroopena drushya svaroopena sthitam |*** There is no defect, there is no grief, ignorance. *Bhraanti * is *anaatmani **aatma vijnyaanaat*, having an idea of *aatman* in that which is not the *aatman. Drushya svaroopa * is that which can be perceived with our eyes. 



***Yat vaa deva manushyaadi tat tat aakaara vishishta pinda   
maatratayaa pratibhaasamaanam |*** In the *vyashti roopa*, the *chetanaas * and *Paramaatman * are existing in the forms of *deva, manushya*; and in all these forms, a *jeevaatman * is existing;  [[61]] we see the body itself as the *jeevaatman*; actually, it is the *deha vishishta **jeevatma vishishta Paramaatman * who is there; that which is perceived by the eyes in the form of *deva, manushya*, etc., He appears in that form alone. Inside the body, there is subtle *jeevaatman*, and this body and *jeevaatman * are the *shareera * of *Paramaatman. Paramaatman * Himself exists in this *vyashti roopa*. 



In reality, He is without any defect, He is *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*; and Him only the people perceive wrongly, in this *vyashti * form. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 7:*** ***Vishnum grasishnum vishvasya sthitou sarge tathaa prabhum |*** ***Pranamya jagataam eesham ajam aksharam avyayam ||*** One who withdraws unto Himself, He is only responsible for creation and sustenance of the world. Having offered my *pranaamams * to such Vishnu, who is of the nature of *avikaaraaya shuddhaaya*, etc., He does creation, dissolution through Brahma, Shiva, He has everything as His body, *kaala, **samashti kshetrajnyaas*, He is in the *vyashti * form also, He is the controller and pervades everything, He exists as everything, I offer my *pranaamams*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Uktam artham upasamharati - vishnum iti |*** All these things which were established is being concluded here. 



***Prabhum srushti aadishu nairapekshyena svacchandam |*** He, by Himself, can independently do creation, etc., without any expectation. He Himself is everything - the *upaadaana kaarana, nimitta **kaarana*, and *sahakaari kaarana*.  [[62]] 



***Ajam aksharam - karma adheena janma naasha rahitam |*** He does not have birth and death due to *karma*. 



***Avyayam - poorvoktam mahaa vibhooteh aprachyutam |*** He has everything as *mahaa vibhooti*, that is His nature.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 8:*** ***Kathayaami yathaa poorvam dakshaadyaih munisattamaih |*** ***Prushtah provaacha bhagavaan abjayonih pitaamahah ||*** Having offered my *pranaamams * to *Paramaatman * of this wonderful nature, I will start teaching you the details as I heard. *Daksha * and all these sages, long back, told this.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 9:*** ***Taih cha uktam purukutsaatha bhoobhuje narmadaa tate |*** ***Saarasvataaya tena api mahyam saarasvatena cha ||*** *Daksha * and others who listened to *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and got the *upadesha * from him, they told *Purukutsa*, who was a king on the banks of the Narmada river; *Purukutsa * taught it to *Saarasvata*, and *Saarasvata * taught me. 



The *paramparaa * comes like this - *Chaturmukha Brahma, Daksha * and other *rishis, Purukutsa, Saarasvata, Paraasharar*. This is the *sampradaaya*, and is most reliable and most authentic. 



 [[63]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Atha shrotrunaam aadaraartham svasya aaptatama guru parva kramam   
aaha - kathayaami iti dvaabhyaam |*** In two *shlokaas, Paraasharar * says, in order to make the listeners get belief in that, and have faith in what he is going to tell, the order, the *guru* *shishya paramparaa*, the *sampradaaya*, how he actually acquired this knowledge which he is going to teach, that he is establishing here in two shlokaas. 



***Bhagavaan utpatti pralayaadi tattvajnyah, \* Utpattim cha vinaasham

***Kutah? Abjayonih yato bhagavat aurasah tat shishyah cha |*** Why? Because He is said to be *abjayoni; **Paramaatman * does *upadesha * of *Veda * to *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and so *Chaturmukha Brahma * becomes the first student of *Paramaatman; **Chaturmukha Brahma * is also created by *Paramaatman*, and is also the son of *Paramaatman*. So, he is also told to be *Bhagavaan*. 



***\* Yo brahmaanam vidadhaati poorvam yo vai vedaamscha prahinoti

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Atha vistarena puraanam vaktum aarabhate parah paraanaam iti |*** Now, *Paraasharar * starts the teach the *puraana * in detail. 



***Parah paraanaam svaroopa roopa guna aishwarya aadibhih   
utkrushtebhyo api urkrushtah |*** In *svaroopa, guna, aishwarya*, He is supreme and superior to even those who are exalted. 



***Paramah svasmaat para rahitah |*** There is no one who is superior to Him. 



***Paramaatmaa - aapnoti iti aatmaa svayam aatmaantara rahitah cha |*** One who controls everything, supports everything, one who rules over everything. He is *aadhaara, niyaamaka * and *sheshi*. Everything else is *aadheya * to Him, everything is *niyaamya*, and *shesha bhoota * to Him. He does not have any other person who rules over Him. 



 [[65]] ***Aatma samsthitah sva aadhaarah | *** He is the support of Himself. 



***Roopam samsthaanam deva aadi jaatih varnah shukla aadih |*** *Roopa * is the *samsthaana*, the classes told as *deva, manushya*, etc., *varnaas * are the colours. 



***Aadi shabdena kriyaa dravye grahyete |*** *Kriya* and *dravya * like *danda, kundala*, are told. 



***Nirdeshah sanjyaa |*** He cannot be called with a particular colour or class because He can take any form He wants. It is not decided like the *baddha chetanaas*. 



***Etaih jaati guna kriyaa dravya naamaakhyaih kalpanaa hetubhih   
visheshanaih vivarjitah |*** We cannot imagine Him to be only of a particular colour or *jaati * or *dravya*. 



***Roopa vargeti paathe vargo jaatih |*** There is a *paathaantara, roopa varga*, here *varga * means *jaati*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Shadbhih bhaava vikaaraih varjitah iti aaha - apekshaya ityadinaa -   
apakshaya iti |*** There are six *bhaava vikaaraas * which all beings undergo - *asti, jaayate, **vivardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*. Here, *apakshaya * is *apaksheeyate, vinaasha * is *nashyati, **parinaama * is *viparinamate, vruddhi * is *vardhate, **jamabhih * include *asti * and *jaayate*. He is without any of these *bhaava **vikaaraas*. 



We cannot tell Him through *roopa, varna*. We cannot also tell Him with the six *bhaava vikaaraas*. How can we ever address Him. Is it possible to tell Him? 



***Sadaa asti iti vachanaat kadaachitka astitva vikaaro nirastah |*** Most objects we say that they exist at a particular point of time. This cannot be told so for *Paramaatman*. 



***Etat sattayaa anabhivyaaptasya kaalasya abhaavaat |*** For *Chaturmukha Brahma*, he does not exist after 100 years, but time exists after that also, but he does not exist. In a like manner, all objects exist at a particular point of time and do not exist beyond some point of time. Time exists all the time, but objects do not exist all the time. However, for *Paramaatman*, there is no time at which He does not exist. He exists all the time. 



***Anena kaala anavacchedah uktah |***  [[67]] He is not limited by time. This is told here.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 12:*** ***Sarvatra asou samastam cha vasati atra iti vai yatah |*** ***Tatah sa vaasudeva iti vidvatbhih paripathyate ||*** He exists in all the places, and everything exists in Him. he is told as *Vaasudeva*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Desha anavacchedam naama vishesha nirvachanena darshayati sarvatra

How are they all supported by Him. This is just like *jaati, guna*, as sunlight is supported by Sun, as *jaati *- cowness is supported in a cow; in the same way, *Paramaatman * supports everything, and everything is dependent on Him. He supports everything, is told. 



***Agni jala aadibhih nabha iva sarva gato api tadgata doshaih   
asamsprushto dyotate iti aaha - deva iti |***  [[68]] *Vaasudeva - vaasu * means *vasati samastam atra, sarvatra asou vasati; **devah * means *dyotate *- He shines forth. He shines forth untouched by any defects, He is existing everywhere. Just like space pervades everything, He pervades water, fire, everything. The defects of water, fire, space do not touch space. In the same way, *Paramaatman * pervades everything, untouched by the defects of all the objects. He shines forth like that. 



*Bhagavad svaroopa * is being explained in a most wonderful way by *Paraasharar*. All the *achetanaas*, and *samashti kshetrajnyaas * which are seen here, all *drushya padaarthaas*, and *kaala*, are *Brahman * only, are all *shareera * of *Parabrahman. Paramaatma svaroopa * is told in terms of all the *tattvaas*, and the nature of these *tattvaas * are also explained. These are controlled by *Paramaatman*, and He is the *antaryaami * of everything, everything being His *prakaara*, His mode, being His *shareera*. He is only existing as everything. This is what we see in the *Shrutis*. 



*Paramaatman*, is *Vaasudeva*, the *devataa vishesha. Vyutpatti * of the word *Vaasudeva * is *vaasuh cha asou devah cha, vasati sarvatra, sarvatra asou **samastam cha vasati atra iti vai yatah, tatah sa vaasudeva iti vidvadbhih **paripathyate*. Everything is residing in Him, and He resides in everything. He shines forth, and He is *deva. Deva * is *dyotate*, He has got most wonderful lustre; Sun and moon which have brightness are all possible to have that because of *Paramaatman * only. *Na tatra sooryo bhaati na chandra taarakam, **nema vidyuto bhaanti kuto ayam agnih, tam eva bhaantam anubhaati **sarvam yasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bibhaati*, is told in *Kathopanishad*. Only because of His brilliance, everything else shines forth. He is *Vaasudeva*, the *devataa vishesha*, the Supreme Brahman, He is without any *shat bhaava **vikaara*, He is *ekaroopa * all the time, He has a *divya mangala vigraha*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Esha eva vedaanta vedyam brahma iti aaha - tat brahma iti |*** *Vaasudeva * who pervades everything, and everything is residing in Him. As established in the *Shrutis, antar bahih cha yat sarvam vyaapya naaraayanah **sthitah*. He is known from *Vedaanta*, the Upanishads establish His *svaroopa * most wonderfully. 



***Akshayam apakshaya rahitam |*** He doesn't undergo any change. 



*Kshaya * is getting deteriorated, and that is not there for *Vaasudeva*. 



***Avyayam parinaama vivruddhyakhya avasthaantara rahitam |*** He is not undergoing different states like *parinaama, vivruddi*. There is no question of growing like what we see in the *baddha jeevaas*. 



***Atah eka svaroopam |*** Because of this, He is all the time of the same nature, unchanging immutable nature.

The eight defects of the mind, which make it impure, are told - *kaama, krodha, moha, harsha, maana, mada, mati, **vishaada. Mati * means desire. These defects do not exist in *Paramaatman*. 



Five *pancha kleshaas * are told in *Yoga Sutra. Asmitaa * is thinking of *chitta, **antahkarana*, ego as *aatman. Pancha kleshaas * come due to *karma*. 



In *mukta aatmaas * also, at one time they were associated with *heya*, these kind of defects; after that they got released from that. *Heya abhaavaat **nirmalam * differentiates Him from *baddha jeevaas. Sadaa heya abhaavaat **cha nirmalam * differentiates Hims from *muktaas* also.

Four entities are told here -*vyakta *\(when *prakruti * is differentiated into name and form, and is visible, what is manifested\), *avyakta *\(unmanifest state of *prakruti*\), *purusha *\(all the *chetanaas*\) and *kaala*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[71]] ***Vastutah anavacchedam aaha - tat eva iti |*** He is not controlled or bound by anything. He is present in all objects - it cannot be said that He is present in one object and not present in another object. He is present in every object at all times in all places. 



***Vyakta avyakta svaroopavat etat sarvam tat eva brahma; tathaa tat

*Avyakam akshare leeyate, aksharam tamasi leeyate. * 



***Chit achit prakaarasya brahmana eva vastutvaat vastu antara   
paricchedah |*** If something has to be called as a *vastu, Brahman * has to do *antah pravesha, **anu pravesha*, name and form have to come into existence; *Paramaatman * makes the *jeeva * enter, and He enters along with him. *Paramaatman * associates *jeeva * with *deha, indriya*, and gives him the *jnyaana. Chetanaas * during *pralaya*, have no knowledge, and are just lying down just like *achetanaas*. During *pralaya*, everything merges into *Paramaatman*. During *srushti*, He makes each *jeevaatman * enter a body based on the *karmaas*, and gives them the awareness, the *dharma bhoota **jnyaana * which is there all the time. He gives the *chetanaas * an opportunity to act, think, understand, and uplift themselves. If *Paramaatman * does not enter, and does not do *anupravesha*, does not do differentiation into name and form, there will be no *vastu * at all. If something has to be called as a *vastu*, it is only because *Paramaatmans * existing as its *antaryaami*, by *anupravesha*, everything existing as His mode, as His *shareera*.  [[72]] Everything is His *prakaara*, mode, and He is the *prakaari. **Chit * and *achit * both are His modes. Every name and form denotes *Paramaatman * in the ultimate sense - this is called *aparyavasaana **vrutti*. Why we don't feel like this, is because of our lack of knowledge, we limit the connotation of name and form to that *chetana * only. We don't experience the depth of the complete connotation of the words. All the *chetanaas * in *samashti, vyashti * or in any state, are all modes of *Paramaatman*, and become *vastu * because of *Paramaatman * only. There can be no object which is without *Paramaatman*. There is no object in which *Paramaatman * does not exist.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 15:*** ***Parasya brahmano roopam purushah prathamam dvija |*** ***Vyakta avyakte tathaa eva anye roope kaalah tathaa aparam ||*** Four things are told - *purusha, vyakta, avyakta, kaala*. All these are said to be *Brahmanah roopam*. 



This is a very important *shloka * for our *siddhaanta*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Heya pratyaneeka kalyaana guna aashrayasya brahmanah vikaara   
apurushaartha aadi dosha aashraya sarva taadaatmye tat gataa   
doshaah prasajnyeran nityaashankya \* yasya aatmaa shareeram \*   
ityaadi shruti siddha shareera aatma bhaavena taadaatmyam na tu   
svaroopena iti aaha parasya iti |*** The *taadaatmya*, that *Paramaatman * is existing in everything as *antaryaami*; everything is *Brahman, sarvam khalvidam brahma*, everything is a mode of *Paramaatman*, being His *shareera*; this identity, oneness, *taadaatmya*, is it by *svaroopa * itself, or through *shareera aatma bhaava *- is what we have to  [[73]] understand. It is not in the *svaroopa*. If it was *svaroopa*, only one will exist, and second one cannot exist. *Taadaatmya * is not by *svaroopa * but through *shareera aatma bhaava. **Chetana * and *achetana * exist, *Paramaatman * also exists; they both exist inseparably all the time, *Paramaatman * being the controller and support all the time, *chetanaas * and *achetanaas * being the controlled and supported, they are independent entities always associated with *Paramaatman* inseparably; without *Paramaatman * being there, they cannot even exist; their *sthiti, pravrutti * is controlled by *Paramaatman*. This existence of *Paramaatman * in all these forms - this tree is *Paramaatman*, this book is *Paramaatman*, this table is *Paramaatman *- this oneness is by *shareera aatma bhaava*. All these are *shareera * to *Paramaatman. **Paramaatman * exists as inner controller. This is established in the *Shrutis*, as in *Yasya aatmaa shareeram. Yah pruthivyaam tishtan, yah pruthivyaam **antarah, yam pruthivi na veda, yasya pruthivi shareeram, yah pruthivim **antaro yamayati*, ... says *Yaajnyavalkya*. Finally, he says, *yah aatmani **tishthan, aatmano antarah, yam aatmaa na veda, yasya aatmaa shareeram, **yah aatmaanam antaro yamayati, sa te aatmaa antaryaami amrutah*. Even *jeevaatmans * are also His *shareera. Pruthivi, ap*, etc. are all His *shareera*. He exists in everything, controlling from inside. None of them know that He is existing there. He is all the time present in everything. This is told in the *Shruti * itself. 



Otherwise what is the defect that comes. *Paramaatman* is of the nature of *heya pratyaneeka kalyaana gunaashraya*. His nature is opposed to everything that is evil, and He is abode to only auspicious qualities. There are two objects we see - *chetana * and *achetana. Achetana * has got the defect of *vikaara *- it undergoes change in its very essential nature itself; its *svaroopa * itself goes on changing. For *jeevaatmans*, there is *apurushaartha *- contraction and expansion in their *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*. For these kind of objects which have these defects, if *Paramaatman * is said to be one with these, will not the defects of these objects also ensue to *Paramaatman*? This doubt is removed by the *shruti **pramaana, yasya aatmaa shareeram*.  [[74]] 



In this *shloka*, the word *roopam * is *paryaaya pada * for *shareera*. This is explained clearly by *Bhaashyakaarar * in *Vedaartha Sangraha*, and also by *Sri **Sudarshana Suri * in the *vyaakhyaana. Shrutis * and *smrutis * use many words which are *paryaaya padaas * for *shareera. Tanu, vapu, shakti, amsha, kaaya, **roopa *- are all used for *shareera*. There are three relationships - *aadhaara **aadheya, niyaamaka niyaamya, sheshi shesha*. 



***Purushasya kartrutva bhoktrutva chetanatva aadinaa prakrutim iti   
praadhaanyat prathamyam |*** Compared to *prakruti, purusha * is superior because *Purusha * has *kartrutva *\(agency\), *bhoktrutva *\(enjoyership\), *chetanat**va *\(He has *jnyaana aashraya*, He is knower\). 



*Purusha, vyakta, avyakta, kaala * are His *shareera*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 16:*** ***Pradhaana purusha vyakta kaalaanaam paramam hi yat |*** ***Pashyanti soorayah shuddham tat vishnoh paramam padam ||*** 



*Avyakta * is also called *pradhaana*. 



This is also an important *shloka * for our *siddhaanta*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[75]] ***Sarvasya brahma roopatva vachanena chodyam katham parihrutam   
ityata aaha - pradhaana iti |*** The doubt raised here is: Everything is *Brahma roopa*, it was said. *Brahman * exists as *samashti, vyashti*, everything. At the same time, we say that Brahman is without any defect and is abode to all auspicious qualities. If we see *Brahman * in all objects here, how do we know that *Brahman * has this *shuddha svaroopa * also. 



***Paramam padam - padyata iti padam, para praapyatva roopam, yatah   
pradhaana aadi roopebhyah paramam vilakshanam tasmaat soorayah   
shuddham roopa bhoota pradhaana aadi gata vikaara ajnyaana aadi   
rahitam paramam jnyaana aananda aadibhih sarvotkrushtam cha   
pashyanti iti arthah |*** The meaning of *padam * is that which is attained, this is the form of *Paramaatman * which is attained ultimately, and is called *Parama Pada*. This is also explained by *Bhaashyakaarar * in *Vedaartha Sangraha. Parama **Pada * has got three meanings \(i\) It is the *svaroopa * of *Paramaatman*, \(ii\) *jeevaatma svaroopa*, because that is also something which is attained, \(iii\) *Sri Vaikuntha*, where *Paramaatman * is present, and the *nitya sooris * are all there. Here, it is the form which is attained in *Vaikuntha*. Compared to *pradhaana, purusha, vyakta, kaala*, it is different and distinct. This is where the *shuddha roopa * of *Paramaatman * is present, and the *nitya **sooris * are seeing all the time, *sadaa pashyanti soorayah. Bhagavaan's divya **roopa * which exists in *Sri Vaikuntha*, said to be *Parama Pada * here, is *shuddha*, does not have the *vikaara * and *ajnyaana * which is present in *pradhaana, purusha, vyakta, kaala * which have a form. He is different and distinct from all these. The doubt raised is thus cleared.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 17:*** ***Pradhaana purusha vyakta kaalaah tu pravibhaagashah |*** ***Roopaani sthiti sarga anta vyakti sadbhaava hetavah ||***  [[76]] 



This *shloka * establishes many important aspects of our *siddhaanta*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Nanu pradhaana aadeenaam naana roopatvena bhedaat brahmanah   
tadgata vikaara aadi doshaah maa bhoot |*** *Pradhaana, purusha*, etc. each has a different form. There is a clear distinction from one to the other. Let us accept that the *vikaara * does not touch *Brahman. Brahman * is untainted by defects of all these objects. 



***Jagat upaadaana bhootasya brahmanah katham vikaaraadi apraapti iti   
ata aaha - pradhaana iti |*** But, if *Brahman * is said to be the material cause of all these objects, how can Brahman be without the defects of all these things? *Brahman * if it is the material cause, has to undergo a change to become the effect. How can there be not the defect of modification or change in *Brahman*? This is the next doubt. This is answered here. 



***Pradhaana purusha vyakta kaalaa roopaani pravibhaagashah -   
parasparam vikaaritva bhoktrutva aadi svabhaava asankarena   
sthityaadeenaam vyaktou jnyaptou sadbhaave cha hetavah |*** It is answered that it is not so, because the characteristic of *vikaaritva * of *pradhaana*, and *bhoktrutva * of *chetanaas*, they are all without getting mixed up, they are the ones which are the forms of *pradhaana, purusha, vyakta, kaala*. Without getting mixed up with each other, they become the cause of *sthiti*, etc., being seen by the eyes, being known when they manifest, and their presence itself. 



 [[77]] When we plant a seed, after some time, we can say that a tree has come into existence, and we can see that it is a tree. Every object, every entity exists here without any *saankarya*. The cause of their forms is their own bodies, and not *Paramaatman. Paramaatman * exists as inner controller, not getting changed; the change is in the body, *shareera. Paramaatman * does not undergo any change. 



***Vyaktih visheshah |*** There is a special characteristic. 



***Hetu shabdo brahmanah tebhyo niyantrutva sheshitva aadinaa vishesha   
pradarshanaarthah |*** The cause of all these things is their own forms, and Brahman is different and distinct from these. There is a change - the *jeevaatman's dharma **bhoota jnyaana * undergoes a change. *Achetana * undergoes a change in essential form itself. These two being the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, the change is in the *shareera*, and not in the *Paramaatman * Himself, though He becomes the *upaadaana kaarana*. 





Why should *Paramaatman * do the *srushti*? This is answered here. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 18:*** ***Vyaktam vishnuh tathaa avyaktam purushah kaala eva cha |*** ***Kreedato baalakakasyeva cheshtaam tasya nishaamaya ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Nanu pradhaanaadeenaam srushti aadi hetutvaat vishnoh katham   
kaaranatvam ata aaha - vyaktam iti |***  [[78]] If we say that *pradhaana * and others are the cause for the changing world, then how can *Bhagavaan * be told as the *kaarana*? How can we say that He is the *sarva kaarana*? This is told in this *shloka*. 



***Vyaktaadeenaam tat adheena svaroopa sthiti pravruttitvena tat   
shareeratvaat tat vishishtasya vishnoh kaaranatvam na anupapannam |*** Though there is a modification in the *shareera * only, how can it change without *Paramaatman * being there? Everything is controlled by *Paramaatman*. The very existence of these *chetana achetanaas*, their functioning, and their essential nature, everything is under the control of *Paramaatman*. In this way, they become the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, and *Paramaatman * who is qualified by these becomes the cause. This is not unreasonable. 



***Vyaktam vishnuh iti aadi | Vyakta aadi shareerako vishnuh iti arthah |*** *Vishnu * is only what is manifested, the unmanifest is also *Vishnu*, *purusha* is also *Vishnu, kaala * is also *Vishnu*, the meaning is *vyakta shareerakah **vishnuh, avyakta shareerakah vishnuh, purusha shareerakah vishnuh, kaala **shareerakah vishnuh*. The *saamaanaadhikaranya * has to be like this only. 



*Saamaanaadhikaranya * has been explained as *bhinaa pravrutti nimittaanaam **shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih saamaanaadhikaranyam*. If two words which are in the same *vibhakti * tell the different aspects of the same object, this is *saamaanaadhikaranya*. The object which is qualified by these characteristics is one only. The identity is not in the object and attribute, but the two objects which are qualified by two different aspects, for example, *jagat kaarana vishnuh*, and *vyakta shareeraka vishnuh*, these are in *saamaanaadhikaranya*. The *vyakta * which is *brahmaatmaka*, having *Brahman * as the inner controller, and *Vishnu * who is the *jagat **kaarana*, there is *saamaanaadhikaranya. Vishnu * is one only in both. It is not between *Vishnu * and *vyakta * that the *saamaanaadhikaranya * is to be taken.  [[79]] 



***Nanu avaapta samasta kaamasya prayojana abhaavaat srushti aadih na   
upapadyate iti at aaha - kreedata iti | Kreedaa eva prayojanam iti   
arthah |*** This is all a play for *Paramaatman*, just like a boy is playing with a ball. Just like a boy plays for mere pleasure, *Paramaatman * also does *srushti * for *kreedaa*. It is mere sport for Him, though He is *avaapta **samasta kaama*. Whatever He wills, He will attain it. If He does *sankalpa*, that will definitely happen. 



*Lokavat tu leelaa kaivalyam. Leelaa eva kaaranam*. This is explained by *Bhaashyakaarar*. A *saarvabhouma*, ruler who has got everything, also engages in sport, just for entertainment. Like this, it is not unreasonable for *Paramaatman * to do *srushti*, as *leelaa. Leelaa * is also explained as *dayaa **kaarya*, as all *chetanaas * are lying as *achetana*, and if *srushti * does not happen, they cannot uplift themselves. Out of compassion, *Paramaatman * does *srushti*.

***Avyaktam iti | Yat tat iti | Bhagavat roopatayaa uktam yat avyaktam

Whatever they have told is in line with what is taught in the *Shrutis*. There are others like *Saankhya * by *Kapila * which are opposed to what is told in the *Shrutis*, these are not acceptable. 



The name of *Kapila * comes in the *Shrutis*, and whatever is told by him has to be accepted, is the objection. This objection is removed by *Brahma Sutra **kaarar, Baadaraayanar*, that *Saankhya Smruti * has a lot of things which are  [[81]] opposed to what is taught in the *Shrutis*. One of them is that *pradhaana * is *abrahmaatmaka*; they do not accept *Brahman*; they have only *purusha * and *prakruti*; creation happens when the *pradhaana * modifies itself; it is *abrahmaatmaka * they say, and it acts by itself; this is not acceptable and is not as per what is told in the *Shrutis*. 



*Sat shabdavaachya brahma * is told. *Asat shabdavaachya * is also told, which means that *naama roopa vyaakarana * was not there. When nothing was differentiated into name and form, it is called as *asat*. This entire universe of *chetanaas, achetanaas * was existing as *sat shabda vaachya*, as *sookshma **chit achit vishishta Paramaatman*, before *srushti*. He became *sthoola chit **achit vishishta Paramaatman*, after *srushti*. Like fire which exists in the wood, but is not seen. When two wood pieces are rubbed, then *agni * is supposed to be produced.

Primordial matter is *nitya * means that it is not the effect of something; *akaarya * means that it is not an effect, does not have a *kaarana. **Paramaatman * does not create *avyakta * during *srushti*; *avyakta * is an eternal entity existing all the time - *achetana*. In the *avyakta * form, it is an eternal entity. *Paramaatman * only makes *avyakta * to undergo modification being its inner controller, *antaryaami*; it becomes *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc., they then merge back in the reverse order, and then it remains as *avyakta. **Meya * means measurable, and *ameya * means immeasurable. *Prakruti * is existing everywhere in this *prakruti mandala*. It does not become old. It is  [[82]] without any vibrations. It does not have *shabda, sparsha*, etc., they comes only after *pancheekarana*. After *pancheekarana*, the *aakaasha * is formed, and it has got quality of *shabda, vaayu * has got quality of *shabda * and *sparsha*, etc. Even the forms are not there before *pancheekarana*.

pumaan tat aaseet ||*** 



***Vishnoh svaroopaat paratodite dve roope pradhaanam purushascha   
vipra |*** ***Tasya eva te anyena ghrute viyukte roopaantaram tat dvija kaala   
samjyam ||*** 



These *shlokaas * are *pradhaana pratipaadaka shlokaas*. We shall take them up in the next class. 



***Question***: Please explain the terms *mahat * and *prakruti*. ***Answer***: *Prakruti * is also told as *avyakta * or *pradhaana*, which is primordial matter, which is the unmanifest state of matter, at the time of *pralaya*. During *srushti, Paramaatman * being the *antaryaami*, makes it to undergo change, and a part of it undergoes change. It is *trigunaatmaka*. It undergoes change and becomes a new entity called *mahat *- this is also an inert *tattva*, unseen, unmanifest. *Paramaatman * who is *antaryaami * of *mahat*, makes it to undergo change, and it becomes *ahamkaara*. There are three *ahamkaaraas - **saatvika, raajasa, taamasa*. From the *saatvika * and *raajasa ahamkaaraas*, eleven *indriyaas * are created. From the *raajasa * and *taamasa ahamkaara, **pancha tanmaatraas * and *pancha bhootaas * are created. Then *pancheekarana * happens. 



We were studying the nature of *prakruti * and *purusha*, that existed before *srushti*, at the end of *pralaya*. In order to teach about *srushti, **Paraasharar * tells about the *svaroopa * of *pradhaana * and *purusha * and others, at the time of the end of the *pralaya*, before *srushti*. Then he will start  [[84]] telling about *srushti*. While telling this, he tells that everything is *Paramaatman * only, everything is *Bhagavaan's shareera*; the change that happens is only in the *shareera * and not in the *Paramaatman*, who is inseparably associated, and is immutable. If He does not undergo any change, if the change is only in the *shareera * which is *chetana * and *achetana, **\(svaroopa vikaara * in the *achetana * and *svabhaava vikaara * in the *chetana * in the *dharma bhoota jnyaana*\), how can *Paramaatman * be called the cause of creation? It is because the very existence, sustenance and functioning of these *chetanaas * and *achetanaas*, is controlled by *Paramaatman*, and they are all inseparably associated with Him. As a qualified entity, He can also be called as the cause - He is the main cause. Creation is a mere sport for Him, *Kreedato baalakakasyeva cheshtaam tasya nishaamaya*, just like a boy is playing. *Kreedaa eva prayojanam iti arthah*. 



*Avyakta*, which is called as *pradhaana * by *Manu * and other *rishis*, is the cause. It is *prakruti*, very subtle, *sookshma, nitya*, eternal. It is not an effect; it is the cause of *mahat, ahamkaara*; it is an eternal entity, always existing. There is no vibration - *sattva, rajas, tamas * are all equal in proportion at the time of *pralaya*. It is *triguna*, has three qualities. *Shabda, **sparsha*, etc. are not there at the time of *pralaya*, and are manifested at the time of *vyashti srushti*, when the division happens into name and form. 



*Veda vaadis*, establish reality only based on what is taught in the *shrutis*. *Brahma vaadis * accept that *Brahman * is only the *kaarana*, the cause. 



Two *shlokaas * about *pradhaana * are well known.

Because there was no *shabda*, etc., everything was merged in *pradhaana, prakruti*, it was *avyakta*, and not divided into name and form. *Pancha bhoota **tattvas * were not there. There was nothing that could be known through *shrotra * and others.

In *srushti*, causes become effects, and *kaarana* becomes *kaarya, **prakruti * becomes *mahat, mahat * becomes *ahamkaara, **ahamkaara * becomes *tanmaatraas*, etc. In *pralaya*, it is reverse order, *tanmaatraas * become merged into *ahamkaara, ahamkaara * merges in *mahat, mahat * merges in *prakruti*, then all the *samashti purushaas * join together, everything joins *Paramaatman. Avyaktam akshare leeyate, **aksharam tamasi leeyate, tamah pare deve ekee bhavati*. 



In *shruti*, it is told wonderfully about *pralaya*. There is *naasadeeya sookta*, in *Rig * and *Yajur vedaas*. There was nothing - there was no death, nor immortality, it was one with *svadhaa*. There is a question asked - who knows from where everything came? Who created all these things? *Yah asya **adhyakshah parame vyoman*. In *parama vyoma*, one who is presiding over all these things, He knows. He only knows, nobody else knows. 



***Na aho na raatrih iti sthoola kaala upaadhi bhoota jyotitaraadi   
nishedhe api tadaa aaseet iti nirdeshaat sookshmah kaalah asti iti   
gamyate |*** *Kaala* is said to be two - *akhanda kaala * and *khanda kaala. Akhanda **kaala * means there is no division - there is one time. *Khanda kaala * means we see divisions like *kalaa, kaashtha, muhoortha, aho, raatri, paksha, maasa, **samvatsara *- this is *oupaadhika*. It is told that there is no day, no night, no light, no darkness - those which give the division of time we see here. The word *tadaa * indicates time. Though there was no division of time we see here, like day, night, etc., one *akhanda kaala*, the *sookshma kaala * still existed at that time.  [[87]] 



So, what existed before *srushti * was *pradhaana * or *avyakta, **Brahman * and *samashti purushaas. Brahman * is *nitya vibhooti vishshta. Nitya **vibhooti * is outside the scope of this creation and destruction. *Nitya **vibhooti * is eternally present there. *Paramaatman * who is *nitya vibhooti **vishishta, divya soori vishishta, divya bhooshana, divya aayudha, divya **mahishi*, was existing, along with *pradhaana * and *samashti purusha*. 



***Vishnoh svaroopaat iti | Atra svaroopa shabdo roopa vachanah;   
svaroopaat roopaat |*** This means from *Vishnu's shareera*. It is not that *Bhagavaan's * essential nature itself divided into *purusha * and *pradhaana*. 



*Chetana samashti * and *achetana * which was existing as *avyakta *- they were present at that time. Two forms which are *pradhaana * and *purusha * manifested. 



***Udite udbhoote; aarshah sandhih |*** We can say as *paratah udite*, which is *aarsha sandhi*. 



***Dite iti paricchede vibhakte iti arthah tasmaat tamas sanjaayate \* iti   
shruteh |*** Or can say that *paratah dite, viyukte*, separated. Two forms separated from Him, inseparably associated but differentiated. 



***Te roope viyukte |*** 



 [[88]] ***Srushti arha samyoga virahite yathaa syaataam tathaa tasya eva, yena   
anyena ghrute stah tat roopaantaram kaala sanjyam |*** *Avyakta * and *samshti purusha * were united into *Paramaatman * as if they cannot be separated as though they are one. During *srushti*, they manifest in such a way that they can become effects, can manifest themselves in the gross form; they become separated from *Paramaatman * in such a way that they can manifest. Another thing which supports this is *kaala*, time. 



***Te anye anye aarshatvaat saadhuh sandhih |*** This is the *aarsha sandhi * told by a *rishi*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 25:*** ***Prakrutou samsthitam vyaktam ateeta pralaye tu yat |*** ***Tasmaat praakruta samjnyah ayam uchyate pratisancharah ||*** *Pratisanchara * means *pralaya*. This *pralaya * is called *praakruta pralaya*. Whatever was present in *prakruti*, when creation happens, it gets manifested. Because it was all merged into *prakruti*, and present in *prakruti*, it is called *praakruta pralaya*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Prakrutou iti | Prakrutou samsthitam leenam | Pratisancharah -

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 26:*** ***Anaadih bhagavaan kaalo naanto asya dvija vidyate |*** ***Avyucchinnaah tatah tu ete sarga sthiti anta samyamaah ||***  [[89]] *Avyucchinnaah * means unceased, or uninterrupted. *Kaala * is always there, it is like a *pravaaha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kaalasya prakruti purusha samyojakatvaat vyakta utpatti aadi   
pravaaha hetutvaat cha vyaktavat na prakrutou layah iti aaha -   
anaadih iti |*** *Paraasharar* says that everything is merged into *prakruti*, so it is called *praakruta paralaya. Purushaas * are existing separately, they are *chetanaas*, they are united together as *tamas*, united in *Paramaatman*. At time time, what happens to *kaala*? Everything happens at a particular time, *srushti * happens at a particular time. Getting manifested, creation, are like a continuous stream happening; in this way, one of the causes is also *kaala*. Like *vyakta*, whatever is manifest, *kaala * does not merge into *prakruti. Kaala * is said to be *anaadi *- there is no beginning and there is no end. 



***Tatah - kaalaat; kaalasya anaadyantatvaat sarga kaala nirodhah   
samyamah jagat niyamana anupravesho vaa | *** *Sarga* \(creation\), *sthiti *\(sustenance\), *anta *\(the end or *pralaya*\), *samyama *\(cessation of creation\) - these four things are told. Or *samyama * can be told as *jagat niyamana anupravesha * doing *anupravesha* for controlling happens. 



***Prakruti purusha roopavat kaala roopam api parasmin antarhitam |*** Just like *prakruti * and *samashti purushaas * which get united with *Paramaatman * and stay one with Him, *kaala * is also united with *Paramaatman*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 27:*** ***Guna saamye tatah tasmin pruthak pumsi vyavasthite |*** ***Kaala svaroopam tat vishnoh maitreya parivartate ||*** Now, starting of *srushti * is going to be told. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Prakruteh avishada satata parinaama ganita dvi paraardha   
kaalaavasaane prathamam srushti kaala unmeshanam aaha guna   
saamya iti | *** The *srushti kaala * starts. *Paraardha * is half of the life of *Chaturmukha **Brahma. Dvi paraardha * means two *paraardhaas. Paraardha * is said to be the highest number that is possible to count - this is 50 years of *Brahma's * life. *Avishada * means that is not manifest. At the end of hundred years of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, is when *praakruta pralaya * happens. Up to that, it is continuously undergoing changes. After that is *praakruta pralaya*, and then *srushti * happens, creation starts. 



***Guna saamye sattva aadi guna saamya roope guna saamya   
niroopaneeye tasmin pradhaanam pumsi cha prutham vyavasthite   
pruthak viyukte sthite sati, tat kaala svaroopam parivartate - srujya   
jeeva karma anuguna sarga anukoolam bhavati iti arthah |*** In *pralaya* time, *sattva, rajas, tamas * are all equal. If one of them changes, *srushti * happens. At the time when *pradhaana * can be known as having *sattva, rajas, tamas * as equal, when the primordial matter and *chetanaas * were existing separately, how does time get modified? It becomes favourable for creation according to the *karmaas * of the sentients who are all going to be part of creation. We can say that time becomes ripe for creation. 



 [[91]] *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shlokaas 28, 29:*** ***Tatah tu tat param brahma paramaatmaa jaganmayah |*** ***Sarvagah sarvabhooteshah sarvaatmaa parameshvarah ||*** Then the *Paramaatman*, who has everything as His body, is present everywhere, the ruler of all beings, ... 



***Pradhaana purushou cha api pravishyati aatmecchayaa harih |*** ***Kshobhayaamaasa sampraapte sarga kaale vyaya avyayou ||*** *Vishnu, Sriman Naaraayana*, out of His own willing, *sankalpa*, enters into *pradhaana * and *purusha*, when the time for creation comes, causes disturbance in *prakruti*, which is *vyaya*, which undergoes change, and *avyaya*, which is the *chetanaas, jeevaatman * who do not undergo any change, after entering into them. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Atha srushtyartham pradhaana pumsoh kshobhamaaha - tata iti |*** 



***Pradhaanam iti | Aatmecchayaa \* bahu syaam iti sankalpaatmikayaa,

It means making that as the object of His action. Disturbance, is that He made them ready for creation. What is the readiness of *pradhaana * for creation, means, He creates disturbance in the three qualities, *sattva, rajas, tamas*, so that it  [[92]] starts getting modified. For *chetanaas*, the readiness for creation is *jnyaana **vikaasa*; during *pralaya*, their *dharma bhoota jnyaana * is contracted very much, so that they are lying down like *achetana*; during *srushti*, He will make them know, and his experiences and impressions from the earlier births, he will be made aware of all that. *Vyaya * is *vikaara*, undergoing change, and *avyaya * is *kootastha, jeevaatmans * will not be undergoing any change. Through this disturbance, He makes them ready for creation. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 30:*** ***Yathaa sannidhi maatrena gandhah kshobhaaya jaayate |*** ***Manaso na upakartrutvaat tathaa asou parameshvarah ||*** This is an example given. Just by mere presence, mere nearness, fragrance creates disturbance or agitates what is nearby, of the mind; fragrance by mere nearness, can cause change to undergo in the mind, without being an instrument; in the same way, by *Paramaatman*, the disturbance is like that. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Eeshvarah prakruti purushayoh kshobhane api svayam avikaarah iti   
aaha - yathaa iti |*** *Paramaatman * is *avikaara*, does not undergo any change; His mere presence, His *sankalpa * can cause disturbance. 



***Yathaa gandhah kinchit vikaara rahito api sannidhi maatrena manasah   
kshobhaaya sukha dukha aadi vikaaraaya bhavati |*** The fragrance does not undergo any change, it is just present nearby. Just its mere presence causes *sukha* and *dukha*, which are *vikaaras * of the mind. The mind undergoes change.  [[93]] The fragrance does not undergo any change, it is just present nearby. Just its mere presence causes *sukha * and *dukha*, which are *vikaaras * of the mind. The mind undergoes change. Just like this, *Paramaatman's * presence can itself cause change in *chetana * and *achetana*. 





A question arises. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 31:*** ***Sa eva kshobhako brahman kshobhyah cha purushottamah |*** ***Sa sankocha vikaasaabhyaam pradhaanatve api cha sthitah ||*** The one who causes this disturbance is also He only, the one who undergoes disturbance is also He only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Gandha drushtaantena tasya nimittatvam eva kim iti aashankaayaam   
upaadaanam api sa eva iti aaha - sa eva iti |*** The *gandha * which is present, which causes disturbance in the mind, is not *upaadaana kaarana * for those effects, it is only *nimitta*. Is *Paramaatman * also only *nimitta kaarana*, as *gandha drushtaanta * is given. How can He be told as *upaadaana kaarana * also? This is established here. 



***Kshobakah san pradhaana purushaatmakam svayam eva kshobayati |*** He, who has *pradhaana* and *purusha * as His body, changes Himself. 



***Na hi svasmaat bahirbhootam kulaalo mrut pindam iva, \* tat   
aatmaanam svayam akuruta \* aatma kruteh; \* sah abhidhyaaya   
shareeraat sukhaat \* ityaadibhyah |***  [[94]] It is not like a potter who creates a pot out of mud, which is external to him. It is not like that for *Paramaatman. Paramaatman * is not doing like that. He Himself makes effect into Himself. 



This is told wonderfully in the *Prakruti Adhikarana*, which is the last-but-one *adhikarana* of the fourth *paada * of the First Chapter of *Brahma Sutraas*. There are six *sutraas*, and the first of these says " *Prakrutih cha". **Paramaatman * is only the *upaadaana kaarana*. One of the reasons why He is told as *upaadaana kaarana * is *aatma kruteh*. From His own *shareera*, doing *sankalpa*, He created all these beings. *Achetana, chetana * are all His *shareera*, inseparably associated. Still He remains unchanged all the time. There is no change in His *svaroopa svabhaava*. There is change only in His attributes, which are *chetana * and *achetana. Achetana * undergoes change in *svaroopa * itself, and *chetana * undergoes change in *svabhaava*, according to the *karmaas * of the *jeevaatman*. 



***Na kevalam jagat upaadaanam, kaarya bhootam jagat api sa eva iti   
aaha - sa sankocha iti | Sankocha-vikaasaabhyaam yuktah   
pradhaanatve api sthitah sa eva |*** He is *nimitta kaarana * is told first; then it is told that He is *upaadaana **kaarana*. Not only *upaadaana kaarana*, He is only present as effect. The world which is an effect is also He only. Associated with contraction and expansion, He is also present as *pradhaana*. Everything is Himself, but He is also their *shareeri*. They are all inseparably associated. The *shareeri * does not undergo any change. 



We also see this in the *jeevaatman*. During young age, middle age, old age, all the changes happen to the body, whereas *jeevaatman * remains unchanged inside. They are associated inseparably. In the same way, *Paramaatman * who is *antaryaami*, though there is change in the *jeevaatman's dharma bhoota jnyaana*, He does not undergo any change. He being *antaryaami * of everything, is present as everything, as everything is  [[95]] His *shareera*. Anything which has name and form is there only because He has done *antah pravesha*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 32:*** ***Vikaasa anu svaroopaih cha brahma roopa aadibhih tathaa |*** ***Vyakta svaroopah cha tathaa vishnuh sarveshvareshvarah ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vikaasa iti | Vikaasa anusvaroopaih vyashti samaashti roopaih cha,   
tathaa brahma aadi roopaih cha yuktah; sa eva vyakta svaroopah -   
mahat aadi svaroopah cha |*** *Vikaasa svaroopa * is whatever is manifested in the gross form. And what is in the *samashti*, collectivity, and Brahma and other forms; everything, He is only associated. The *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc. are also He only. He is the supporter of everything. 





Now, *srushti * is going to be told. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 33:*** ***Guna saamyaat tatah tasmaat kshetrajnya adhisthitaat mune |*** ***Guna vyanjana sambhootih sarga kaale dvijottama ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Srushtim aaha - guna saamyaat iti | Tatah - kshobhaanantaram |   
Kshetrajnya karma preritaat guna saamyaat - guna shakti saamya   
roopaat pradhaanaat, vyajyante anena gunaa iti guna vyanjanam   
mahat tattvam, tasya sambhootih |***  [[96]] *Tatah * means after *Paramaatman * starts creation. From the *pradhaana * which was existing before *srushti*, having all *gunaas * in equality, being impelled by the *karmaas * of the *kshetrajnyaas*. At the time of *srushti*, the first thing created is *guna vyanjana*, which is *mahat tattva*. In the *moola **prakruti * form, the *gunaas * are all equal. Whereas when there is some disturbance, and something undergoes change, then *prakruti * becomes *mahat*. In the *mahat*, some *guna * will be prominent. 



We saw so far how before *srushti*, *Paramaatman * makes them ready for creation, and brings awareness, *samskaara*, and makes it ready for *guna **vaishamya*; He being *antaryaami * is the cause, and everything happens in Him. Everything is Him only, and the effect is also Him only. He is only the *upaadaana kaarana*, the material cause. Though He is *upaadaana **kaarana*, He does not undergo any change. It is not like a potter who makes a pot out of mud. 



*Bhagavaan * will start when the time comes; He does the *sankalpa, kaala * will make everything ready. Time becomes right for creation to start, according to the *karmaas * of all the *jeevaas. Paramaatman * will do *anupravesha*, He will impel them; the *guna saamya * will get disturbed; *guna vaishamya * will come in *pradhaana*, He will do *sankalpa - bahusyaam prajaayeya*. With all the changes happening in *prakruti * and *purusha, Bhagavaan * remains unchanged. 



An example was given, of fragrance. Fragrance, when present creates a reaction in the mind, and it does not get changed in any way. *Paramaatman * also does not get changed in any way; He brings about changes in *prakruti * and *purusha*. And, He is also not just *nimitta **kaarana * like fragrance, but He is also the *upaadaana kaarana*, as the changes happen in Him only. Because everything is associated inseparably with *Paramaatman * only. Changes are in *Paramaatman's shareera * and not in His *svaroopa * or *svabhaava. Achetana * and *chetana * are inseparably associated  [[97]] with Him as His *shareera*. He is controlling them, He is their support and master. 



Creation of the various *tattvaas*, in order, is going to be told now. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 33:*** ***Guna saamyaat tatah tasmaat kshetrajnya adhisthitaat mune |*** ***Guna vyanjana sambhootih sarga kaale dvijottama ||*** 



There is a *vaishamya * in the *gunaas * which is happening, one of them becomes more or less, and creation starts. *Moola prakruti * becomes *mahat. **Mahat * becomes *guna vyanjana. Vyajyante anena gunaah *- qualities are shown in this. Impelled by the *karmaas * of the *kshetrajnya*, the *jeevaatmans*, due to *prakruti*, the *mahat tattva * is formed at the time of creation. 





The next stages of creation are explained. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 34:*** ***Pradhaana tattvam udbhootam mahaantam tat samaavrunot |*** ***Saatviko raajasah cha eva taamasah cha tridhaa mahaan ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pradhaana tattvam iti | Udbhootam mahaantam tat pradhaanam   
samaavrunot | *** *Pradhaana tattva * envelops the *mahat tattva*. 



 [[98]] ***Yadaa udbhootam iti pradhaana visheshanam | Saatvika ityaadi |   
Saatvikatvaadikam pradesha bhedhena udbhootam guna trayam |*** *Sattva, rajas * and *tamas gunaas *- one of them becomes more and based on this, the state changes. This modifies into three different *tattvaas *- *saatvika **ahamkaara, raajasa ahamkaara, taamasa ahamkaara*. The three qualities of *pradhaana, saatvika, raajasa * and *taamasa * are told. From that, they are manifesting.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 35:*** ***Pradhaana tattvena samam tvachaa beejam iva aavrutam |*** ***Vaikaarikah taijasah cha bhootaadischaiva taamasah ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pradhaana tattvena iti | Samam bahissamantatah | *** *Samam * means from outside completely. As though the seed is enveloped by outer skin, the *mahat tattva * is enveloped by *pradhaana. Pradhaana * is *moola **prakruti*. 



***Vaikaarikah - saatvikah, taijaso raajasah, bhootaadih taamasah,

Saatvika, raajasa * and *taamasa **ahamkaaraas * are told by the terms *vaikaarika, taijasa * and *bhootaadi. **Vaikaarika * means that it is of *vikaara svabhaava*, undergoes changes. *Bhootaadi * also means that it is the cause of *pancha bhootaas*. There is one more *sattva * known as *shuddha sattva*, or *parama sattva*, which  [[99]] is in *Parama Pada*; this *sattva * is different from the *sattva guna * of *prakruti*. Because the *sattva guna * of *pradhaana * undergoes changes. Whereas the *shuddha sattva * in *Parama Pada * does not undergo any change. The *Moksha dharma * quotation is told about how the *vaikaarika * word is mentioned.

From *taamasa **ahamkaara, pancha bhootaas * and *pancha tanmaatraas * are created. *Raajasa **ahamkaara * helps both in the creation of the respective *indriyaas * and *pancha **bhootaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 37:*** ***Yathaa pradhaanena mahaan mahataa saa tathaa vrutah ||*** ***Bhootaadih tu vikurvaanah shabda tanmaatrakam tatah |*** ***Sasarja shabda tanmaatraat aakaasham shabda lakshanam ||***  [[100]] The way *mahat tattva * is enveloped by *pradhaana*, in the same way, the *ahamkaara tattva * is enveloped by *mahat tattva. Taamasa **ahamkaara * will modify and create *shabda tanmaatra*. 



*Tanmaatra * is a middle state. When milk becomes curd, the mid state between milk and curd, called as *kalala*, is like the *tanmaatra*. In the same way, *taamasa ahamkaara * becomes *shabda tanmaatra*, and then becomes *aakaasha. Shabda tanmaatra * is a very *sookshma avasthe*. 



From *taamasa ahamkaara*, assisted by *raajasa ahamkaara, shabda **tanmaatra * is created. From *shabda tanmaatra, aakaasha * is created. From *aakaasha, sparsha tanmaatra * is created. From *sparsha tanmaatra, **vaayu * is created. From *vaayu, roopa tanmaatra * is created. From *roopa **tanmaatra, tejas \(agni\)* is created. From *tejas, rasa tanmaatra * is created. From *rasa tanmaatra, ap * is created, water. From *ap, gandha tanmaatra * is created. From *gandha tanmaatra, pruthivi * is created. *Aakaashaat vaayuh, **vaayoh agnih, agneh aapah, apbhyah pruthivi. Aakaasha, vaayu, agni, ap, **pruthivi * are the *pancha bhootaas*. In between states are the *tanmaatraas*. 



We should understand that there should not be any *virodha * between *shrutis * and *smrutis*. In *shrutis*, in one place, it says ' *Ashtou prakrutayah, shodashakascha vikaaraah*' - there are eight causes, and there are sixteen effects. The eight causes are *moola prakruti, mahat, **ahamkaara*, and five *tanmaatraas*. The sixteen *vikaaraas*, effects, are eleven *indriyaas * and *pancha bhootaas*. 



In the *srushti prakarana * of *Chandogya * and in *Taittriya Upanishad*, the *tanmaatraas * are not mentioned. Whereas in the *laya **prakarana * of *Subaalopanishad*, the *tanmaatraas * are mentioned. *Tanmaatraani bhootaadou leeyante*.

Previous *tanmaatra * envelopes the next *vishesha * and next *tanmaatra*. Because of this, the qualities are carried over from the causes to the effects. 



In our *siddhaanta*, we accept that *pruthivi * has all the five qualities, *shabda, **sparsha, roopa, rasa * and *gandha. Aakaasha * has got only *shabda. Vaayu * has got *shabda * and *sparsha. Tejas * has got *shabda, sparsha, roopa. Ap * has got *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa. Pruthivi * has got all five.

For *agni, roopa tanmaatra*, along with the earlier *shabda * and *sparsha * are needed. If it is not so, if the previous *tanmaatraas * are not associated, it will not be possible. Because of this, *aakaasha * has only *shabda; vaayu * has *shabda * and *sparsha; agni * has got *shabda, sparsha * and *roopa; ap * has got *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa; **pruthivi * has got all the five including *gandha*. Whatever the cause has got, the effects will have that accordingly. There is a *pramaana * quoted from *Vaayu Puraana*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Sparsham iti | Jyotih roopa tanmaatram |*** This is about *agni*. From the *tanmaatra * only the next *utpatti * happens, and not by the element itself.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Sambhavanti iti | Tato ambhaamsi - tatah rasa tanmaatraat poorva   
tanmaatra traya sahitaat |*** Though it is said that it is *rasa*, it is also associated with the previous three *tanmaatraas*. From these four, *ap * is created. *Ambhaamsi * is waters. The previous *tanmaatraas * enveloping this *tanmaatra * and the *vishesha*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 43:*** ***Vikurvaanaani cha ambhaamsi gandha maatram sasarjire |*** ***Sanghaato jaayate tasmaat tasya gandho guno matah ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vikurvaanaani iti | Ambhaamsi rasa tanmaatraani, sanghaatah   
bhoomih, samhata shabda aadi sarva gunakatvaat, tasmaat gandha   
tanmaatraat poorva tanmaatra chatushtaya sahitaat |*** The *ap * which is undergoing modification, creates *gandha tanmaatra*. From *gandha tanmaatra, pruthivi * is created. *Pruthivi * is said to be *sanghaata, bhoomi*. It is called *sanghaata * because it is collectivity of all the five qualities, *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, gandha. Tasmaat * means, from the *gandha tanmaatra*, associated with the previous four *tanmaatraas, **pruthivi * is created. Its main quality is said to be *gandha*, and it has also the previous four qualities. 



 [[105]] The five elements are created from the *tanmaatraas. Aakaasha * itself will not create *vaayu*, but *aakaasha * will modify to *shabda tanmaatra*, and *vaayu * is created from *shabda tanmaatra. Vaayu * itself will not create *tejas*, but *vaayu * will modify to *roopa tanmaatra*, and *tejas * is created from it. *Tanmaatraas * are the causes of the elements, they being assisted by the previous *tanmaatraas*. 



There are other views. One view is that *aakaasha * will get modified into *sparsha tanmaatra * and *vaayu*. But ultimately, *Paramaatman * being the *upaadaana * and *nimitta kaarana * of everything, and *antaryaami * of everything, everything culminates in Him. He is the sole creator of everything. There is a *pramaana * that *Adbhyo agnih, agni * is created from water, in *Taittiriya Aranyaka*. Whereas in the *srushti prakarana*, it says *agneraapah*, that *ap * is created from *agni*. The *pramaana * from *Taittiriya Aranyaka * is to be taken as *vyashti srushti * and not *samashti srushti*. For example, lightning is said to have water as its cause - from the water carrying cloud, lightning is created. 



The first element *aakaasha * has *shabda * as quality. Second element *vaayu * has got *shabda * and *sparsha * as qualities. Third element *tejas * is created from *roopa tamnaatra*, has *shabda, sparsha, roopa * as qualities. *Ap * is created from *rasa tanmaatra*, it is associated with the previous three *tanmaatraas*, and has got four qualities. The final element, *pruthivi*, is created from *gandha tanmaatra*, and is associated with *shabda, sparsha, **roopa, rasa*.

prakaara eva srushti kramah |*** Now, the explanation of the *vishesha * is given. *Tanmaatraas * are said to be *avishesha*, and elements are said to be *vishesha. Sattva, rajas, tamas*, give rise to the qualities of *shanta, ghora * and *moodha *- peaceful or quiet, frightful; these qualities are not seen in the *tanmaatraas * and hence are called *avisheshaas*. With this, the creation of the elements is concluded. The elements and their respective *tanmaatraas*, are all created from *taamasa ahamkaara*. This is in the order that is told, and not just directly. There are some statements that say that from *aakaasha * only, *vaayu * is created, from *vaayu * only *agni * is created, etc., this is opposed to what is told in the *shrutis*, that there are only eight causes and sixteen effects. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * says that even he has commented that *aakaasha * comes from *shabda tanmaatra * only, and from there, *sparsha tanmaatra * comes, etc. and the order has to be like that. *Shruti * also says that from *pruthivi*, trees are all created. When *prakruti * modifies into trees, *pruthivi * is not the cause of *tattvaas*; so there is no *virodha * there. For example, *vaayu * is not counted as a cause, but *sparsha tanmaatra * is counted as a cause. But, if *pruthivi * becomes a cause for the trees, is this not opposed to the *shrutis*, means, *pruthivi * is not the cause of any *tattva*. There is no contradiction here, as this happens in *vyashti srushti * only. Therefore, what is told here is the order in which is has to be accepted. 





Now, the creation of indriyaas is going to be told.  [[108]] *

manasah srushtih iti |*** From *vaikaarika ahamkaara*, which is *saatvika ahamkaara*, the *indriyaas * are created, assisted by *taijasa, raajasa ahamkaara*. But some people say that from *raajasa ahamkaara * itself, the *indriyaas * are created; *Paraasharar * says that this is not his view, and is not acceptable to him. The *indriyaas * are told as *devaah. Bhagavaan * is there with the *indriyaas * always, but they never know Him. *Paraasharar's paksha * is that they are from *saatvika ahamkaara*. For every *indriya*, there is an *adhishtaatru devataa*, who is presiding over it, and controlling the functions; *indriyaas * are all *achetanaas*, and have an *devataa. Raajasa ahamkaara*, which is called *taijasa * here, only assists *saatvika ahamkaara * and *taamasa ahamkaara * in their respective creations. This is also told clearly in *Vaayu Puraana * also. It is discussed at  [[109]] one place that *manas * is made of *anna*, which is *pruthivi*; this view is not correct. 



The *raajasa ahankaara* only assists *saatvika* and *taamasa ahankaaras* is told in *Vaayu purana*. Another view is also discussed and refuted here: some say that *ahankaara tattva* is only *nimitta kaarana* \(efficient cause\) of *indriyas* and *bhutas* \(elements\) only are *upaadaana kaarana* \(material cause\). They quote the *Upanishat vakya тАУ тАШanna mayam hi somya manah aapomayah **praanah tejomayee vaak*тАЩ. But that is not correct. Because *annamayam* means here anna is *apyaayaka* to *manas* \(that is food is appealing or causes happiness to mind\). So *ahankaara* is only *upaadaana kaarana* and *bhutas* are only *aapyaayakas*. The order of creation of *indriyas* is like this: from *vaikaarika ahankaara* \(or *saatvika ahankaara*\) in order with the help of five *tanmaatras* starting with *shabda tanmaatra*, the five *jnaanendriyas тАУ shabda* and others are created. From *vaikaarika ahankaara* itself with the help of five *tanmaatras* again *vaak* and other five *karmendriyaas* are created. *Manas* is created directly from *vaikaarika ahankaara* only \(without the help of *tanmaatras*\). 



*Saatvika ahamkaara* is only the cause of all the eleven *indriyaas*. This is the *siddhaanta * told by *Sri Engal Aalwaan*.

These sense organs generate the knowledge; when we hear a sound, the organ of hearing generates a knowledge about what is heard; for sensing the objects of the sense organs. How the organs help the *chetana * or person to get the knowledge, is through the mind, *antahkarana*. Mind is the channel for all these. Everything is coming through the mind. *Aatman * connects to the mind; mind connects to the external sense organ, and that connects to the object; this is how it is perceived; and through the mind, it gets conveyed back to the *aatman*. Mind is the channel in between the sense organ and the *aatman*. In this *shloka*, the order is not as told.

Vaayu * has got two *gunaas - shabda * and *sparsha. Tejas * has got three *gunaas - shabda, sparsha, roopa*. Water has got four *gunaas - **shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa; ap shabda * is always in *bahu **vachana*. *Pruthivi * has got five qualities - *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, **gandha*.

Tejas * and *vaayu * are said to be *ghora. Aakaasha * is said to be *moodha*. When they are all mixed up, all of them have got all the three qualities. For example, if the *aakaasha * element is taken, and made into two parts - one half of it is remaining as *aakaasha*; if the second half of *aakaasha * is made into four parts, those four parts are filled with one part of *vaayu*, one part of *tejas*, one part of *ap*, one part of *pruthivi*. So, *aakaasha * is 50 percent *aakaasha*, and 12.5 percent each of *vaayu, tejas, ap, pruthivi*. Similarly with *vaayu, **tejas, ap, pruthivi*. This is called *pancheekarana prakriyaa*. The *Brahma **Sutraas * say that this is done directly by *Paramaatman *- it is told as *trivrutkarana*, which is same as *pancheekarana. Paramaatman * only does this, as *Chaturmukha Brahma * is not yet created. This is directly done by *Paramaatman*, during *srushti*, after *praakruta pralaya*. After *pancheekarana*, if we see the *aakaasha*, it has got 50 percent of *aakaasha*, and 12.5 percent of the remaining four. It is still called *aakaasha*, as it has abundance of *aakaasha*. All the elements have got all the other elements also, in part.

Two knowledgeable persons, were born of *prasaada * and *krodha*, the grace *Bhagavaan*, and out of His anger; *Chaturmukha Brahma * is born out of His grace, and out of His anger, *Rudra * is born; they act only guided by *Paramaatman*; being guided by *Paramaatman * only, they get to be the creators and destroyers; they are only the *nimitta * in this. If *Paramaatman * is not *antaryaami*, they cannot even act. That is why it is told that *Paramaatman * is Himself standing as *pradhaana, purusha*.

Oceans became the liquid in the womb. *Meru * and other *parvataas * are parts  [[117]] of the Cosmic Egg, which is the body of *Paramaatman*. With all these things, *Hiranyagarbha * was existing at the time of creation. The quote is from *Hiranyagarbha Sookta*, which says that *Hiranyagarbha * was there in the beginning, which is *Paramaatman * only.

Water, fire, *vaayu, aakaasha*, and *taamasa ahamkaara*, all these were existing, each ten times. The Cosmic Egg was covered by all these, each ten times. And the *taamasa ahamkaara * was covered by *mahat **tattva*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[118]] ***Vaari ityaadi | Dasha gunaih - dasha gunottaraih |*** Each one is ten times the previous one. There were multiple layers, each ten times more than the inner layer, surrounding the Cosmic Egg.

It was covered by seven layers. All these were covered by *avyakta*, the *pradhaana*. Just like the coconut which has got multiple layers of covering, and inside is the essence.

Effects of *guna **vashyatva * are for *Chaturmukha Brahma * and not for *Paramaatman*.

In this, the *guna vashyatva * is under the sway of *gunaas * of *prakruti*, is only for the *kshetrajnya amsha. Amsha amshi **bhaava * was told. *Kshetrajnya * is *visheshana amsha, **Paramaatman * is *visheshya amsha.

All the things created are protected and nurtured in every *yuga*, as long as the days and nights of *Brahma * are going on. One who is supporting everything, *Bhagavaan **Vishnu*, unparalleled valour.

He is beyond the defects of *guna * and others. *Praakruta sattva, rajas, tamas gunaas * are not there in *Paramaatman*. These qualities, the entire host of sages cannot praise or sing or understand, because they are all far away from *sattva, rajas, tamas*. 



We will take up the further *shlokaas * in the next session. We saw how the *indriyaas * are created, and *pancheekarana * is done, mixing up of the *pancha bhootaas * in the right proportion, and how creation cannot continue without this, then the creation of the *anda*, Cosmic Egg, then *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and further creation by *Chaturmukha Brahma*, with *Paramaatman * as *antaryaami*. This was told as ' *Jagat cha sah*'. Everything is *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, and changes that are happening are in His *shareera. Paramaatman * remains unaffected, and immutable. 



We have so far studied the second half of the second chapter of *Sri Vishnu **Puraanam*, where the creation of the *tattvaas*, the elements, and their mixing up called *pancheekarana kriyaa*, and then creation of the *brahmaanda*, Cosmic Egg, and *Chaturmukha Brahma*, were explained. How it is surrounded by seven *aavaranaas * was told. *Paramaatman*, being the *antaryaami*, creates according to the *karmaas * of the *chetanaas *- he gives them the respective *deha, indriyaas*, etc. He Himself remains untouched by all these. As long as the days and nights of *Chaturmukha **Brahma * are there, *Bhagavaan * protects all that is created. He also supports the *Nitya Vibhooti - shloka * 62 of *Amsha * 1, Chapter 2.

We say ' *Bhagavan pundareekaaksha shriyaa bhoomyaa cha neelayaa | Jagat **rakshana jaagaryaam yoga nidraam upaakuru ||* '. In order to be conscious of protecting the world, do *yoga nidraa*.

The forms responsible for creation, sustenance and end of the world, *Bhagavaan * having them as His *shareera*, controlling them and making them do all the acts, He only does everything, and everything culminates in Him ultimately. Here is a grammatical item mentioned, this is told by a *rishi*, so we have to accept it. Or, the means to the acts of creation, sustenance, etc. - those states of *Brahma, Vishnu * and *Shiva - Bhagavaan * only takes them. Cause and effect - effect is *avasthaantaraapatti * of *kaarana*; another state of the cause. *Bhagavaan * only is the cause and the effect. The modifications and changes are in His body, and in His nature, there is no change. There are changes in His *shareera*.

What is told in this *shloka * is that - *Brahma * the creator, *Daksha * and others who are created, *Rudra * who is the destroyer, the three worlds which are destroyed, addressing them at the same time; there is no difference between the creator and created, the destroyer and the destroyed, because such form is being told. He creates *Chaturmukha **Brahma*, and being his *antaryaami*, creates everything. He protects being *Vishnu*, and destroys being *Rudra*. But, He is not attached to any of these. All the creations happen according to the *karmaas * of *kshetrajnyaas*. He controls the *guna niyantrutva*; the *sattva, rajas, tamas * becoming more or less. When *sattva * is more, *jnyaana pravrutti * happens; when *rajas * is more, there is a lot of action, desire; when *tamas * is more, there is ignorance, sleep. All this happens in the *kshetrajnya * according to his *karma*. The qualities keep varying, being associated with *prakruti*. The *kshetrajnya * experiences various things because of this. Everything happens according to *karma * of *kshetrajnya*, and *Bhagavaan * does not have any enjoyership, *bhoktrutva*. This is explained by the word *svayam prabhuh*; He remains the Lord. Everything is happening in His *shareera * and not in Himself. There is no change in His nature, though He remains *antaryaami * and controls and supports everything.  [[124]]

This world, consisting of *pruthivi, ap, tejas, vaayu, aakaasha*, all the *indriyaas, antahkarana*, and then the *chetanaas*, sentients - is He only. 



He is *sarva bhoota aatma*, inner controller of all beings.

Entire world is His *shareera*, controlled by Him, subservient to Him, being supported by Him. He is *vishva roopa*. He is immutable, unchanging. He is the self of all the beings, the entire world is His *shareera*. Because of this, He is only everything. Creation, sustenance, destruction are all His acts only. *Leela * is all His mere sport; when He is doing creation, sustenance, etc., He is engaged in sport; it is all useful for *Bhagavaan * only, who has taken *leelaa **avataara*. Just as all activities and functions of our body are useful to the *aatman * inside. Just like this, creation, sustenance, destruction are all useful to the *Paramaatman * only. It is *upakaaraka * to Him, who is *shareeri*, and it is all mere sport.

*Atti cha adyate cha *- He only eats, and He is being eaten.

varaneeyah |*** Whatever was told is concluded here. The one who does the acts of creation and others, He is only being created. He only is present in all forms. How can creation and others be attributed to Brahma and others - this is possible because He grants all boons. He gives them the power to do creation, but He being *antaryaami*. Brahma and others who have taken refuge in Him, He gives the boons. The way of creation is being taught to Brahma and others, by *Paramaatman * only. Because of being shown how to do it, they become the creators or destroyers. Krishna says to Arjuna that 'I have already killed everyone, you are only an instrument'. *Atti - adyate cha | Paati - paalyate **cha | Srujya - sarga kartaa cha | * 



What was started as *jagat cha sah*, in this process, the entire creation was told, *pancheekarana, samashti srushti, vyashti srushti*, creation of Brahma and others, and through them doing everything, that it is all His different forms only, was told. Because He does *anupravesha * only, any *vastu * gets *vastutva*; otherwise it cannot even exist. He supports everything. He controls everything, and everything is meant for His purpose. He does creation according to the *karmaas * of the *kshetrajnyaas*. Creation is mere sport for Him. He only creates Himself and protects Himself. He withdraws unto Himself. Entire world is Him only. All these are real entities only. Because He is existing as *antaryaami*, all the words in the ultimate sense connote *Paramaatman * only. 



This concludes the Second Chapter.

But for *Bhagavaan*, it is *heya guna rahitatva*, or *praakruta guna rahitatva. Aprameya * is immeasurable. *Shuddha * is most pure. *Amala aatma * is untouched by any defects. How can creation and other things be attributed for such a person? How can this be accepted? 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Loke raaga dvesha sattva aadi gunakasya shareerinah paricchinnasya

[[128]] When we say that *Parabrahman * is different and distinct from all these, how can we attribute creation, etc., how is it possible, this is the question which *Maitreyar * is asking. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 2:*** ***Sri Paraasharah:*** ***Shaktayah sarva bhaavaanaam achintya jnyaana gocharaah |*** ***Yato ato brahmanastaah tu sarga aadyaa bhaava shaktayah |*** ***Bhavanti tapataam sreshta paavakasya yathaa ushnataa ||*** This is being answered by *Paraasharar * like this. All objects existing, their capabilities cannot be imagined by anyone. In the same way, for *Parabrahman * also, His powers and capabilities are possible. One who is a *sreshtha * among *tapasvis*, just like the capability of causing heat which is present in fire. 



Fire burns, which is the natural power of fire. Like that, every object has got its natural powers. One cannot imagine those powers. *Paramaatman * also is like that, He has got powers. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pariharati - shaktayah ityaadi saardha shlokena | Shaktaya iti | Sarva   
padaarthaanaam vanheh aushnyam iva svaabhaavikyah shaktayah   
tarkaih achintyaah sva saadhaka pramaana gocharaah santi | *** For all objects, just like the burning power of fire, natural powers which cannot be established through debate, which can be known only through its own validity, they exist. 



 [[129]] ***Ato brahmano api \* paraasya shaktih vividhaiva shrooyate svaabhaaviki   
jnyaana bala kriyaa cha \* ityaadi shruti prasiddhaah jagat sarga aadi

His capabilities which are responsible for creation of the world and other things, which cannot be established through *tarka*, such capabilities exist, such natural capabilities. 



***Ato loukika kartru vailakshanye api sarga aadi kartrutvam yuktam | *** Because of that, even though He is different and distinct from any doer, the act of His creation is possible. 



***Sargaadyaa iti | Srujyate anayaa iti sargah | *** Creation and others. *Sarga * means created by these means. 



***\* Akartari cha kaarake \* iti karane ghai pratyayah | *** This is told according to *vyaakarana*. 



***Srushtyaadi karana bhootaa ityarthah | *** These are the instruments for creation, etc. He does not need any instruments like a potter needs various instruments to create a pot. 



***Tapataam sreshtha iti sambuddhih | *** He is addressed as *tapataam shreshta*, one who is excellent among the sages.  [[130]] 



***Atra brahmano ashareeratvam abhyupagamya shaktimatvaat   
kartrutvam uktam |*** Here, *ashareeratva* is accepted, the Brahman does not have a *shareera*. But He has the capabilities, and because of this, He can do creation. 



***Paramaarthah tu divya mangala vigrahavatvam asti eva |*** He is always endowed with *divya mangala vigraha*, the divine auspicious form. This is His reality, established in the *Shrutis*. 



***Yadvaa loke sattva aadi gunakam paricchinnam cha mrudaadi   
upaadaanam drushtam |*** Example given is of a pot, and this is similar to everything else that is created. Mud and other things are taken as material cause in this world, which are also *praakruta*, and *triguna*, and are very limited. 



***Dehaadi yukto raagaadinaa malinah cha kulaalaalih nimittam. *** The *nimitta kaarana*, the efficient cause, is told as the potter and others, who are having a body. 



***Brahmanah tu tat vailakshanyaat katham upaadaanatvam nimittatvam   
cha iti chodyam | *** What is asked here is that *Brahman * who is different and distinct from all these, how can He be attributed with both the material and efficient causes of the world? 



***Uttaram to loke na ayam niyamah |***  [[131]] The answer is that even in this world, there is no rule that it has to be only like this. 



***Dravya lakshane hi nirgunam eva achit dravyam gunaanaam   
upaadaanam drushtam |*** The *naiyaayikaas*, logicians say that whatever is created for an instant, remains without *guna*; that *gunaas* are created after the *dravya * is created. In this way, the *dravya * becomes *upaadaana * for *guna*. The *achit **dravya * which does not have any quality becomes the material cause for the qualities. In this, the rule is broken, that *nirguna dravya * cannot be *upaadaana kaarana*. So, it is not necessary that *trigunaatmaka **dravya * has to be *upaadaana kaarana*. 



***Aparicchinaa eva aakaashaadih shabdaadeh; ashareera eva aatmaa sva   
shareera prerane nimittam drushtah |*** It also need not be a limited object. *Aakasha * which is *aparicchinna * which exists everywhere in this *prakruti * mandala, is unlimited; and it becomes the cause of *shabda * and other qualities. So, *paricchinnatva * is not necessary. And in the case of individual self, he does not have a body by himself, and body is what is seen outside; in his essential nature, he is *jnyaana aatmaka. **Aatman*, being without any body, becomes impeller for the body; he is the *nimitta kaarana * of this. Acts of walking, eating, are controlled by *jeevaatman * inside. He becomes the *nimitta kaarana * of the functioning of the body. He is the *nimitta kaarana * being *ashareeri*. Here also the rule is broken that *shareera * is required for being *nimitta kaarana*. 



***Raaga aadi rahita eva skhalanadou, ayatna eva aayaskaantaadih loha   
bhramanaadou heturdrushta iti evam tvat ukta vyaapti bhangam iti   
abhipraayah |*** What the *naiyaayikaas * say, that the magnet attracts the metal, and nothing is seen there; these are all the things where the *vyaapti * is broken.  [[132]] 



So, we cannot argue through *tarka * that because we see like this in this world, *Brahman * who is *ashareeri*, cannot create. 



***Sarva bhaavaanaam sva kaarya utpaadana shaktayah sva pramaana   
siddhatvaat anya ananyatvaadi vikalpaih avichaaraneeyaah santi |*** All objects have got their own capabilities, to do various things, like fire can burn, and water can cool, they are all self valid; we cannot have options like *anya siddha, ananya siddha*. 



***Yathaa agneh daahakatva shaktih |*** It is like the burning power of fire. 



*Naiyaayikaas* say that it has to be *ananyathaa siddha*. If it is also possible to establish by some other means, then it cannot be told as the cause. Any other thing should not be established as the cause of this effect. If it is *anyathaa siddha*, it can also be established through some other validity. For example, the burning power of *agni * is established directly by itself. In the same way, *Parabrahman * also has such wonderful capabilities, which are told very clearly in the *Shrutis*; that He made Himself into effect. Through logic, this cannot be rejected. 



***Evam brahmano jagat sarga aadi hetavah svaabhaavikyah shaktayah   
santi iti |*** In the same way, for *Parabrahman * also, the natural qualities which are the causes of creation, sustenance, destruction, are existing in *Parabrahman*.

We cannot question why *aakaasha * does not burn; it is its natural power. Who can question all of this? Fire does not burn *aakaasha*; we cannot question. The same is for *Paramaatman's * capabilities also. Also, what is taught by *rishis, Manu, Vyaasa, Paraashara*, who have done *upadesha * of *dharmaas*; one who understands all of them as not opposed to anything told in the *Vedaas*, using logic, true logic according to what is taught in the *Shrutis*, only he knows dharma. We cannot argue against what is told in the *Shrutis *- such a person does not know *dharma. **Tarka * has no definite end; and cannot help in deciding realities. A person can argue in one way; another more intelligent person can argue and establish something different; a third person can come later and argue to establish something totally different. It has to be understood according to what is told in the *Vedaas. Tarka * can be used to understand it in a proper way, but it should always be not against what is taught in the *Vedaas*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 3:*** ***Tat nibodha yathaa sarge bhagavaan sampravartate |*** ***Naaraayanaakhyo bhagavaan brahmaa loka pitaamahah ||*** I am going to teach you how *Bhagavaan * starts to engage in these creation and other things; how *Chaturmukha Brahma * engages in creation and other things.

 [[134]] We will see these *shlokaas* in the next class. 



So far we saw *saamaanaadhikaranya*, concomitant coordination, where everything is told as *Paramaatman * only. Everything is His *shareera*, and He is present as *antaryaami*. All these acts are His mere sport. All objects have their natural capabilities. Though *Bhagavaan * is different and distinct from whatever we see in this world, just as so many objects have so many wonderful powers in this world, which cannot be questioned, in the same way, as *Shrutis * are establishing, *Bhagavaan * also has such wonderful qualities, because of which He is able to do all this creation and others. This has to be accepted. 



***Recap***: We have started *Adhyaaya * 3 of *Amsha * 1 of *Sri Vishnu Puraana*. Where *Maitreyar * is asking how for such a *Bhagavaan * creation is possible. He is said to be the *upaadaana kaarana*, and *nimitta kaarana*; what is seen in the world is that *upaadaana kaarana * undergoes change in its essential nature. Regarding *nimitta kaarana*, we find in this world people having all kinds of defects, *raaga, dvesha*. How can those things be attributed to *Paramaatman*, who is said to be without any defiling qualities, and without any *praakruta gunaas*, immeasurably pure. This was answered by *Paraasharar * as - the capabilities and powers of *Paramaatman*, are something which cannot be even imagined by anyone; He is *sarva shakta, **sarvajnya, satya sankalpa*, endowed with all the auspicious qualities, His nature is opposed to everything that is defiling, one cannot question His powers; similarly we see in this world, just like the burning power of fire, how did fire get that power and why cannot some other object have that power. Every object in this world has its own unique power which can be known from that object itself. If we touch fire, it burns; which proves that it has such wonderful capability. 



Similarly, all *padaarthaas * have got capabilities, which are beyond reach of our mind. *Parabrahman * being of such wonderful nature, we cannot even  [[135]] imagine His capabilities. Because we don't see Him with a form here, we cannot say that one who does not have such a form cannot be the intelligent cause. In this world, we are the efficient cause of our own *sukha, dukha. **Jeevaatman * in his essential nature does not have any form; *jeevaatman * is the *nimitta kaarana * for *sukha, dukha*. Similarly, *dravya * is accepted as the material cause of *guna * also. General examples in this world show that all these things are possible, and objects have wonderful capabilities which cannot be questioned, and they are natural. In the same way, *Parabrahman * also has natural powers and qualities which are causes of creation, of this wonderful world, where He can become the material cause as well as the efficient cause of this universe. This one cannot even question. 



In respect of all things which are *ateendriya*, supersensory, one can know their validity only through *shabda pramaana*, the *Veda shaastra*. This is beyond logic, and one cannot disprove it with logic, as logic has no entry into supersensory aspects. If logic is used with respect to what is told in the *Vedaas*, it is only to firm up our understanding, to firmly establish what is already told in the *Vedaas*. One who used logic, *tarka * to understand what is told in the *Vedaas * by the *rishis*, as not opposed to what is told in the *Vedaas*, only such a person can understand what is dharma.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 3:*** ***Tat nibodha yathaa sarge bhagavaan sampravartate |*** ***Naaraayanaakhyo bhagavaan brahmaa loka pitaamahah ||*** Now that there is no doubt that *Bhagavaan * has such wonderful powers, to be the material and efficient cause of this wonderful universe, know from me how *Bhagavaan * starts to do this wonderful creation. *Chaturmukha **Brahma * does that; he is also said to be *Naaraayana*, because *Naaraayana * is *antaryaami * to him, and in a way, He is only present in that form being *antaryaami*, and gets all creation done through *Chaturmukha Brahma*.  [[136]] 



*Chaturmukha Brahma * is a *chetana*, and *Bhagavaan * being *antaryaami * of *chetana, achetana*, He is the impeller and controller of all activities; having *Chaturmukha Brahma * as His *shareera*, He gets all these things done. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tat nibodha iti | Naaraayanaakhyah srushtou naaraayano loka   
pitaamaho brahmaa brahma roopena |*** In the form of *Brahma*, He gets creation and all of this done.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 4:*** ***Utpannah prochyate vidvan nityameva upachaaratah ||***

He by His own willing is present in every form that is seen here, as the inner controller, *antaryaami * of all the forms we see here. Everything is His mode  [[137]] being His *shareera*; this happens out of His own *sankalpa*. He just wills and transforms into all these things. Changes are happening in His *shareera*, and He remains same *ekaroopa*. Creation or being born in the real sense, is accepting a body due to *karmaas. Jeevaatman * is *nitya*, but due to *karma*, he keeps getting into different bodies, and all the bodies come according to his *karma*. Whereas for *Naaraayana*, this is only in the secondary sense. *Ajaayamaanah bahudhaa vijaayate*, is told with respect to His *avataaraas*. In the same way, *Naaraayana * is seen as *Chaturmukha **Brahma*; there is no *utpatti * for *Naaraayana. Utpaattis * is there only for *baddha chetanaas. Naaraayana * is only born as *Chaturmukha Brahma*; He does *anupravesha*, and *Chaturmukha Brahma * is created. All *chetanaas * are His *apruthaksiddha visheshana*, and He is only present in that form. They are all His *prakaara*, and He is *prakaari*. For Him, there is no change in either His essential nature or attributive nature. He remains the same all the time. During the night of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, He is said to be entering into *Naaraayana*, and in every *kalpa*, again, when he wakes up, he is said to be born; *Brahma * who is one with *Naaraayana*, during the next day, is said to be born again, in the secondary sense. He is present for the duration of two *paraardhaas*, according to the measure of *deva varsha*, which is said to be *nitya*, because it is a very long time; he takes his body according to his own willing. *Chaturmukha Brahma * goes and becomes one with *Naaraayana * every night, is told in *Kurma Puraana*. Having taken refuge in the body of *Chakri*, who is *Sriman Naaraayana*, He becomes one with Vishnu, and is said to have gone into *Vaishnavi * sleep. Everyday he is not born, but because he becomes one with *Naaraayana*, and wakes up in the morning. 





Durations and times are told now. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 5:*** ***Nijena tasya maanena aayurvarsha shatam smrutam |*** ***Tat paraakhyam tat ardham cha paraardham abhidheeyate ||***  [[138]] According to the time period of the *devaas*, his lifespan is said to be hundred years. This hundred years of *Chaturmukha Brahma * is called by the name *para, * half of that is said to be *paraardha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Nijena iti | Nijena braahmena maanena kaala parimaanena | Sarva

Thirty days and nights put together, is called a *maasa. Maasa * has got two *pakshaas*.

One lunar month has got two *pakshaas*; but the thirty *muhoortaas * which form a day and night are solar day and night. Two *ayanaas * are said to be one solar year. Even though there is mix up of lunar month and solar year, the year is said to be solar. *Yuga vyavahaara * is done considering the solar year only. Because of this, the solar consideration only is taken here. 





After having told the *nimesha, kalaa, kaashtaa, muhoorta, ahoraatra, **paksha, maasa, ayana, varsha*, the durations of the *yugaas * are going to be told. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 11:***  [[141]] ***Divyaih varshaih sahasraih tu kruta tretaadi sanjynitam |*** ***Chaturyugam dvaadashabhih tat vibhaagam nibodha me ||*** The *divya varshaas*, according to the *varsha * of *devaas *- our one year is one day for them. Twelve thousand divine years, *divya varshaas*, constitute one *chaturyuga - kruta, treta, dvaapara, kaliyuga*, all put together is called one *chaturyuga*. Know how that is divided and what divisions exist in that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 12:*** ***Chatvaari treeni dve cha ekam krutaadishu yathaakramam |*** ***Divyaabdaahaam sahasraani yugeshu aahuh puraa vidah ||*** Thousands of divine years according to the gods, is divided into the four *yugaas*, as *Kruta yuga *- four thousand years, *Treta yuga *- three thousand years, *Dvaapara yuga *- two thousand years, *Kali yuga *- one thousand years. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 13:*** ***Tat pramaanaaih shataih sandhyaa poorvaa tatra abhidheeyate |*** ***Sandhyaa amsha cha eva tat tulyo yugasya anantaro hi sah ||*** There is *sandhyaa*, before every *yuga*, which is of the same measure as 4, 3, 2, 1, but in hundreds. After the *yuga*, with the same equivalent count of 400, 300, 200, 100, is called *sandhyaamsha*. 



So, there is first *sandhyaa * of 400 years, then 4000 years of *kruta yuga*, then 400 years of *sandhyaamsha*. Again, 300 years of *sandhyaa * of *treta yuga*, then 3000 years of *treta yuga*, then 300 years of *sandhyaamsha * for *treta **yuga*; and then 200 years of *sandhyaa * of *dvaapara yuga*, 2000 years of *dvaapara yuga*, then 200 years of *sandhyaamsha * of *dvaapara yuga*; then 100 years of *sandhya * of *kali yuga*, 1000 years of *kali yuga*, then 100 years  [[142]] of *sandhyaamsha * of *kali yuga*. So, *kruta yuga * has 4800 years, *treta yuga * has 3600 years, *dvaapara yuga * has 2400 years, *kali yuga * has 1200 years, which add up to 12000 years.

Between 400 years of *kruta sandhyaa*, and 400 years of *kruta sandhyaamsha*, there is 4000 years of *kruta yuga*. Similarly, *treta, **dvaapara, kali*. Each *yuga * is preceded by *sandhyaa * and succeeded by *sandhyaamsha*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 15:*** ***Krutam treta dvaaparascha kalischa eva chaturyugam |*** ***Prochyate tat sahasram cha brahmano divasam mune ||*** This is telling about the measure of one day of *Chaturmukha Brahma. Kruta, **treta, dvaapara * and *kali * are together known as *chaturyuga*. Thousand such *chaturyugaas * are said to be one day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 16:*** ***Brahmano divase brahman manavastu chaturdasha |*** ***Bhavanti parinaamam cha teshaam kaala krutam shrunu ||*** In one day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, O *Maitreya*, fourteen *Manus * are present.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 18:*** ***Chaturyugaanaam samkhyaataa saadhikaa ekasaptatih |*** ***Manvantaram manoh kaalah suraadeenaam cha sattama ||*** The duration of each *Manu * is told here. Seventy one *chaturyugaas * and a little more, constitute one *manvantara*. 



If we take 71 *chaturyugaas * per *Manu*, and 14 *Manus*, 14 x 71 becomes 994, which means that 6 *chaturyugaas * are left. If those 6 *chaturyugaas * are distributed across 14 *manvantaraas*, it will be a little more than 71 *chaturyugaas *- 5143 *divya varshaas*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Manvantare deva samvatsara samkhyaam aaha - ashtaaviti | Adhikam   
vineti vakshyati, tat atra api sambadhyate |*** In terms of gods years, it is told here. 



Divine years are converted into years of mortals, by multiplying by 360. One year of man is one day of the gods. 4800 years is the *kruta yuga*, 3600 is *treta*, 2400 is *dvaapara*, 1200 is *kali*. Multiply each by 360, and we get 4,32,000 divine years for *kali yuga*.

In terms of mortals, 30 crores, 67 lakhs, 20000 years, \(30,67,20,000 years\) is the period of a *Manu*.

At the end of this day, *pralaya * happens, this is said to be *braahma prati sanchara*. This is *naimittika pralaya*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 23:*** ***Tadaa hi dahyate sarvam trailokyam bhoorbhuvaadikam |*** ***Janam prayaanti taapaartaa maharloka nivaasinah ||*** All the three *lokaas - bhooh, bhuvah, suvah*, all get burnt; this is said to be *naimittika pralaya*. The seven *lokaas - bhooh, bhuvah, suvah, mahah, **janah, tapah, satyam *- out of these the three *lokaas bhooh, bhuvah, **suvah * get destroyed; and because of the heat, the people residing in the fourth *loka mahah * move to the fifth *loka, jana loka*.

This is explained in the *vyaakhyaana*, which we will see in the next class. 



In this sectionr, we saw the divisions of time, *nimesha, kalaa, kaashthaa, **muhurta, ahoraatra, paksha, maasa, ayana, varsha*; we also saw the durations of the four *yugaas*, and the day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, which contains 1000 *chaturyugaas*, and how these are divided. There is *sandhyaa * and *sandhyaamsha * before and after each *yuga*. At the end of a day of *Chaturmukha Brahma, naimittika pralaya * happens, and all the three worlds are going to be engulfed in fire. *Paraasharar is * explaining the various durations of the *Chaturyugaas*, the fourteen *Manvantaraas * in a day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, in terms of *deva **varshaas*, and *manushya varshaas*, the divisions and counts. Fourteen *Manvantaraas * are one day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*; at the end of the day, the *pralaya * is called *Braahma*, or *naimittika pralaya*; those staying in *mahar loka * move to *janar loka*.

***Evam brahmaa bhogishayyagata iti atraapi naabhi saroruha

***Tathaa cha sri vishnudharme \* Ekaarnave jagatyasmin brahmanyabhita

***\* Sva naabhi kamalodbhoota kamalodara shaayine | *** One who is sleeping on the lotus which has come out of His navel. 



***Iti cha bhagavato jalashaayitvam brahmanah padmodara shaayitvam   
cha uktam | *** *Bhagavaan* is sleeping on the waters, and from His navel, there is a lotus which has come up, and on that *Chaturmukha Brahma * is sleeping. 



***Tathaa cha sreehari vamshe \* Poorne yugasahasre \* iti aarabhya

***Sahasra sheershaa purusho rukmavarnastu ateendriyah | Sushvaapa

When it says that *Chaturmukha Brahma * is sleeping on the *Aadishesha*, it is to be understood like this - *Bhagavaan * is sleeping there, and in His *naabhi*, there is a *padma * which has come out, and *Chaturmukha Brahma * is sleeping on that lotus.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 3, Shloka 25:*** ***Janasthaih yogibhih devah chintyamaanah abjasambhavah |*** ***Tat pramaanam hi taam raatrim tadante srujate punah || *** *Yogis * who are present in the *jana loka*, they meditate upon Him.

One day has fourteen *Manvantaraas*, and an equal duration of one night happens. Like  [[151]] this, 365 days is one year, and like this, one hundred years will pass. This hundred years is said to be the life span of *Chaturmukha Brahma*.

Half of it is *paraardha*. This half lifespan is already spent. At the end of this first half lifespan, which is called on *paraardha*, the *mahaa kalpa * called *paadma*, happened. This is the last *kalpa * of the first fifty years of *Chaturmukha **Brahma*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 3:*** ***Ateeta kalpa avasaane nishaa supto sthitah prabhuh |*** ***Sattvodriktah tadaa brahmaa shoonyam lokam avaikshata ||*** At the end of the *kalpa * which just passed, he slept the whole night and then woke up. Having woken up, after the night, he was having excess of *sattva*, and saw the world which was totally empty. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Atha paadma kalpa kathaa vishayaat brahma proktaat paadma

To show that it is called *Vaishnava Puraana*, he starts to talk about *Varaaha kalpa*. What is told by Brahma is called *Braahma **Puraana*; it was told for the good of the whole world; that is *Paadma **Puraana*. All the things which happened in the *Vaaraaha Kalpa*, whatever *Paraashara * has told, all *dharmaas * told, that is *Vaishnava Puraana. **Bhagavaan * has done *anupravesha*, and *Bhagavaan * is well known for His *avataara, Varaaha*.  [[154]] 



In this fourth chapter, *Varaaha avataara* is going to be told. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 4:*** ***Naaraayanah paro achintyah pareshaam api sa prabhuh |*** ***Brahma svaroopi bhagavaan anaadih sarva sambhavah ||*** *Brahma * who woke up from sleep, with excess *sattva*, he saw the world which was empty, and He is *Naaraayana, para*, Supreme, beyond out thinking, lord of all, He Himself is present as *Brahma*, beginningless, cause of everything. 



We get a doubt here whether *Brahma * and *Naaraayana * have *svaroopa aikya*. This is made clear here. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 5:*** ***Imam cha udaaharanti atra shlokam naaraayanam prati |*** ***Brahma svaroopinam devam jagatah prabhavaapyayam ||*** This *shloka * is being told about *Naaraayana*. The Lord who is present in the form of Brahma, and who is the cause of creation and destruction of the world. *Manu * and others tell this. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: *** ***Atra brahma naaraayanayoh svaroopa aikya shankaayaam manu   
aadayoh tayoh bheda param naaraayana vishayam shlokam   
udaaharanti iti aaha imam cha iti |***  [[155]] *Manu * and others have told *shlokaas * which clearly mention that *Chaturmukha Brahma * and *Naaraayana * are different and distinct. 





This *shloka* is from *Manu Smruti*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 6:*** ***Aapo naaraa iti proktaa aapo vai narasoonavah |*** ***Ayanam tasya taah poorvam tena naaraayanah smrutah ||*** This is *shloka * about *Naaraayana * which clearly states that He is different and distinct from *Chaturmukha Brahma*. The waters are said to be *Naaraa*, and they are the progeny of *Nara*. They are the residing place for Him, He is said to be *Naaraayana*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: *** ***Tam eva shloka darshayati aapa iti | \* Praaduraaseet tamonudah \* iti

Whatever is created from Him are *naaraah*. Everything that is created is indicated by *ap shabda * here. Whatever was created from *Nara*, are all called *naara*, they are the resting place for Him. Because He is *antaryaami*, He is residing in everything as *antaryaami*. This is one of the *vyutpattis * for *Naaraayana **shabda * according to *Bahuvreehi samaasa. Naaraah ayanam yasya sah **naaraayanah | Naaraanaam ayanam naaraayanah * is *tatpurusha samaasa*.  [[156]] In *Shruti, swara * itself will tell how the meaning is to be taken. When He becomes *antaryaami*, then only the *vastu * gets the *vastutva. Naaraayana * is different from *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and there is no *svaroopa aikya. Naama **roopa vyaakarana * was done after His *anupravesha*. He is present as *antaryaami * in any object which has name or form. Ultimately, everything connotes *Bhagavaan * only in *aparyavasaana vrutti*. They are all His *shareera*, inseparably associated with Him. That which is *aadheya, niyaamya, **shesha * is *shareera*. Water is *Vishnu's shareera. Poorvam * means before *srushti*. Before *srushti, Naaraayana * is the cause, *kaarana*. This clearly distinguishes the effect and cause. In the causal state, *Bhagavaan * is said to be *Naaraayana*, and in the state of effect, *Chaturmukha Brahma * is created, and He is residing as *antaryaami*. So, He is different and distinct from *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 



*Aaseet idam tamobhootam aprajnyaatam alakshanam |* It was called *Tamas*, and it was without any name and form differentiation. And then, *Bhagavaan * creates from that.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 7:*** ***Toyaa antasthaam maheem jnyaatvaa jagati ekaarnaveekrute |*** ***Anumaanaat tat uddhaaram kartukaamah prajaapatih ||*** The whole world has become one huge ocean. He inferred that I have to do *uddhaara* of this world.

He took on the form of *Varaaha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Toyaantaam iti | Toyaantaam samaheem iti paathaantaram |

Seeing this, He inferred that the world is immersed in this, and I have to uplift this world and bring it out. Having taken the form of the boar, He entered into the water. 



*Bhagavaan * took on the form of *Varaaha*, and entered into the water in order to save the world. 





This is a wonderful explanation of the *Varaaha Avataara*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 9:*** ***Veda yaynya mayam roopam ashesha jagatah sthitou |*** ***Sthitah sthiraatmaa sarvaatmaa paramaatmaa prajaapatih ||*** As though it is made of *Veda * and *yajnya*, as though the world is supported by *Veda * and *Vaidika dharma*, is the meaning. For the purpose of sustenance. 



 [[158]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Veda iti | Veda yajnya mayama roopam veda yajnya mayatvena

He Himself is the support of Himself, there is no other support. He entered into the waters, one who is supporting the world. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Jana loka iti | Abhistutah strushtyartham udbodhita mahimaa;   
stooyamaana hi devataa veeryena vardhate iti nyaayaat |*** It is well known that when a *devataa * is praised, the *veerya * increases.

I was created by You only. I was born from You only. From this ocean that has formed, please do save me.

I offer my obeisance to You.

All these You do during creation and others, taking on the form of *Brahma, Vishnu * and *Rudra*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tvam iti | Brahma ityaadi - brahma vishnu rudra roopa dhara |*** Taking on the form of *Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra*, You only do creation, sustenance and destruction of this world.

The gods worship You in the form of Your *avataaraas*. 



This is one of the *prayojana * of *avataaraas*, as is also seen in *Geetha **Bhaashya*. If *Bhagavaan * does not do *avataara*, nobody will know in which form to worship *Bhagavaan*. The supreme form which He exists as *Paravaasudeva*, nobody has seen or can imagine. How to do *dhyaana * without a form? The mind needs an *aalambana*, a support for meditation. This is why *Bhagavaan * does *avataara*, in order to show a form, in which all can meditate upon Him and worship Him. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 18:*** ***Tvam aaraadhya param brahma yaataa muktim mumukshavah |*** ***Vaasudevam anaaraadhya ko moksham samavaapsyati ||***  [[162]] Those who are desirous of getting liberated, they were liberated by worshipping You only. Who can get liberated without worshipping *Vaasudeva*. *Vasati atra iti vai yatah, sarvam yatra vasati, **sarvatra asou vasati. * 



Like this, *pruthivi * is eulogizing *Bhagavaan * in the *Varaaha avataara*, in these most wonderful *shlokaas*. Further, *pruthivi * praises the *yajnya svaroopa*, and the *Varaaha roopa * is explained by *Paraasharar*. 



*Pruthivi Devi * is eulogizing *Mahaa Varaaha*. The *Varaaha Stuti * by *pruthivi * has started. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 17:*** ***Bhavato yat param \(roopam\) tattvam tat na jaanaati kaschana |*** ***Avataareshu yat roopam tat archanti divoukasah ||***

One who knows everything by Himself. You are only the gross universe that is being seen, hail to You. You don't undergo any change, You are immutable. You are endless, You are unmanifest. You are *mahat * and others. 



Definition of *sarvajnya * as told by *Aalavandaar * is *yo vetti yugapat sarvam **pratyakshena sadaa svatah*, He knows everything at the same time, directly, all the time, by Himself. 



*Mahat * itself is said to be unmanifest; but compared to that, *Bhagavaan's * form is still more subtle. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Jaya iti | Akhila jnyaana maya - sarvajnya | Sthoolam jagat - tanmaya

Various layers of the earth are told - *shveta bhouma, rakta bhouma, shilaa **bhouma, rukma bhouma*. Crossing all of this, it came to *Vaaraaha **loka*. *Brahmaanda * was torn apart into two halves by *Hari*. After that, He again came back to the original place.

Now, the *Aadi Varaaha Chatusshloki * which is famous, and is commented upon in *Sri Bhaashya * in detail, comes, in the next four *shlokaas*. 





 [[175]] *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 38:*** ***Paramaarthah tvam eva eko naanyo asti jagatah pate |*** ***Tavaiva mahimaa yena vyaaptam etat charaacharam ||*** *Paramaartha * is that which is real, there is no other Lord. He is *chit achit **vishishta*, so everything is said to be Him only. You are the Lord of the universe. All this is Your glory only. All the movables and immovables are pervaded by Your *mahimaa * only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Paramaartha ityaadi | Paramaarthah satyah | Tvat vyatiriktah   
paramaartho naasti \* Bahu syaam \* Sa brahmaa sa shivah sa indrah sah

charaacharaatmano mahimaa, atah tvat aatmakam eva idam sarvam   
iti, tvat anyah ko api paramaartho naasti iti bhaavah |*** There is no other *paramaartha * other than You. *Bhagavaan * did *sankalpa *'Let Me become many', He Himself became many. Everything is His *vibhooti*, all are told in *saamaanaadhikaranya*. He is the *antaraatman * of everything. The multiplicity of *brahmaatmaka * and *abrahmaatmaka * does not exist. *Brahma * was also born in Him only. He is everywhere. Having entered, He became *sat * and *tyat, chetana * and *achetana*. You who are the material cause of everything, all the movables and immovables are pervaded. This is all Your greatness, glory. Everything is *bhagavadaatmaka*; You are the inner self of everything. There is nothing other than You which can be said to be *paramaartha*. This all pervasiveness of Yours, with which You are pervading all the movables and immovables, is Your glory. 



 [[176]] This is also explained in *Sri Bhaashya. Paramaarthah tvam eva ekah **ityaadyapi na krutsnasya apaaramaarthyam vadati. Api tu krustsnasya **tadaamakatayaa tat vyatirekena avasthitasya apaaramaarthyam. * Because everything is *bhagavat aatmaka*, there is nothing which is existing apart from Him as not being *bhagavat aatmaka*. Because You are pervading all these movables and immovables, everything is *bhagavat aatmaka*, having You as inner self, there is nothing other than You. Because of being the inner self of everything, You are only the *paramaartha*. This all pervasiveness which is there, is Your glory, greatness. Otherwise, if everything was illusion, it would have been told *bhraanti*. It is not said *bhraanti*, but *mahimaa. Bhaashyakaarar * mentions the *Mahaa Varaaha **avataara * of *Vishnu Puraana * here. O Lord of the universe, all these become secondary if everything was illusion. This whole *prakarana * is eulogizing the *Mahaa Varaaha*, who uplifted the universe, very easily, without any difficulty. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 39:*** ***Yat etat drushyate moortam etat jnyaanaatmanah tava |*** ***Bhraanti jnyaanena pashyanti jagat roopam ayoginah ||*** All that which are manifest, the gross form, this universe which is being seen, all is Your form only, because You are the one who is pervading all these as the inner self. All these are Your form only. Those who do not have that *yoga*, who have not performed that meditation, which is the means to experience the fact that everything is *Bhagavat aatmaka*, are *ayogis*. Those who do not have the means to experience that You are the inner self of everything, they see everything as that form which is seen only; this is a wrong perception. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yat etat iti | Yat etat jagat drushyate jnyaanaatmanaa tvayaa   
aatmatayaa vyaaptatvaat etat tava moortam moortih, tasmaat *** [[177]] ***ayoginah tvat aatmakatva anubhava saadhana yoga virahinah, etat   
kevala deva manushyaadi roopam iti bhraanti jnyaanena pashyanti |*** The *ayogis * perceive this whole world as simply made of gods and humans, and such forms only, which is a wrong perception. They do not perceive the inner self, existing in everything. Because of the inner self existing in everything, every form seen in this world is a manifestation of *Bhagavaan * only. All are His mode, His *shareera*. 



This is also explained in *Sri Bhaashya * in a similar way. The *ayogis * see as 'This is only the human that I am seeing', 'This is only the *deva*', 'This is only the animal that I am seeing' - like this, they perceive only the form that they are seeing. They do not perceive the *aatman* who is inside. Because of *Paramaatman* being inside only can anything function, or exist. That is why they are seeing with a wrong perception; they see as an illusion. 





Recap:The first two *shlokaas * of the *Aadi Varaaha Chatusshloki*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 38:*** ***Paramaarthah tvam eva eko naanyo asti jagatah pate |*** ***Tavaiva mahimaa yena vyaaptam etat charaacharam ||*** 



Everything is You, and is inseparably associated with You. You are the only truth, the real truth. The *sat-shabda-vaachya Brahman * willed and said 'May I become many'. He is only *Chaturmukha Brahma, Shiva, Indra*, everything; all are His *vibhootis*. Everything is *Brahmaatmaka*, there is nothing which is *abrahmaatkama. Brahmaatmaka abrahmaatmaka naanaatva * does not exist. *Prahlaada* experiences that *Paramaatman * is everywhere, all pervading, *ananta*; I am only everything; everything is existing in Me. Having  [[178]] entered, He became the sentient and non-sentient. There is nothing is other than *Hari*. 



It is said ' *Tava esha mahimaa*'. If it was unreal, it would have been told ' *Tava **esha bhraantih*'. This is also the same experienced by *Nammaazhvaar*. He said that I am only the worlds, the oceans, the earth, everything is created by me only. *Nammaazhvaar * experiences the ' *Aham Brahmaasmi'. * Because everything *brahmaatmaka*. Every *roopa, naama * ultimately denotes *Paramaatman*. 



By His *mahimaa*, His wonderful powers, everything is pervaded. By You who is the material cause of this entire universe, the movables and immovables are all pervaded. This is Your wonderful *shakti * that You are being seen as all the movables and immovables here. Everything is having You as the inner self. There is nothing which exists, which does not have You as the inner self. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 39:*** ***Yat etat drushyate moortam etat jnyaanaatmanah tava |*** ***Bhraanti jnyaanena pashyanti jagat roopam ayoginah ||*** 



The whole universe which is being seen here, which is also real, is pervaded by You as the inner self. This is all Your *shareera*. Those who do not have the means to realize, that everything is having You as the inner self, the see all the things that are perceived here as mere forms of that person, being; they do not see the *Parabrahman * who is *antaryaami*. He is only the inner controller existing in everything. Everything is His *shareera*, being inseparably associated with Him, controlled by Him and supported by Him. Those who do not see this perceive with *bhraanti jnyaana*, as an illusion, which is wrong perception.  [[179]] 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 40:*** ***Jnyaana svaroopam akhilam jagat etat abuddhayah |*** ***Artha svaroopam pashyanto bhraamyante moha samplave ||*** 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vastutastu tvadaatmakasha jagatah kevala deva manushyaadi   
roopatvena darshanam eva na bhramah, jnyaanaakaaraanaam   
aatmanaam deva manushyaadi arthaakaaratva darshanam api bhrama   
ityaaha jnyaana svaroopam iti | Jnyaana svaroopam   
jnyaanaatmakatvam iti arthah | Atra jnyaana shabdena jnyaana guna   
saaratvaat pratyagaatma uchyate | Na ayam shlokah para vishayah,   
yushma shabda adarshanaat | Prakruti purusha viveka eva naasti kutah   
tvat darshanam iti bhaavah |*** 



The *brahma * told is not mere seeing of all the forms as bird, or cow, or mountain, as that form only; not realizing the *Paramaatman * who is *antaryaami*; this is one *bhrame*. The second aspect is that there is also a *jeevaatman * inside each. A *manushya * who is seen is *manushya deha **vishishta jeevaatma vishishta Paramaatman. Chit achit vishishta **Paramaatman * is there is every being. External appearance is the *achetana*, the body, *shareera*. Inside is the *jeevaatman*. Controlling both of these is *Paramaatman*, for whom both of these are *shareera*. The entire world which has You as the inner self, seeing it as only that form, this is not the only *bhrame * which exists. The individual selves which are also of the nature of consciousness, is *deha aatma bhrame*; when we call a person *Devadatta*, we think that only the external appearance, body is *Devadatta*, without realizing the *jeevaatman * who is inside. Here, *jnyaana svaroopam * is referring to the *jeevaatman*. Those who are not knowledgeable, they see only the external appearance; they are deluded. By *jnyaana shabda * is meant *pratyagaatma*, one who has a *jnyaatrutva*. It is not mere knowledge,  [[180]] but *jnyaana * with *jnyaatrutva guna*. A knower is only told as *jnyaana*, mere consciousness, because the aspect of knowership is the most prominent characteristic of a *jeevaatman. Tat guna saaratvaat tu tat vyapadeshah **praajnyavat*, is a *Brahma Sutra. Vijnyaanam yajnyam tanute * is from *Taittiriya Upanishad*. Here, it is not *viyjaana*, but *vijnyaataa*. Here, the most essential characteristic of *jeevaatman*, which is knowership is told. His *svaroopa * is also *jnyaana*, and *guna * is also *jnyaana*. 



This *shloka * is not about *Paramaatman*, as there is no *yushmat shabda*. Here, yogis are praising *Varaaha roopi Paramaatman; Sanaka, Sanandana* and others are euologizing Him; earlier it was told about *Paramaatman*. Now, it is not a repetition telling about *Paramaatman*, it is about *jeevaatman*. They do not have the discriminatory knowledge of the body and *jeevaatman * is itself not there, how can they realize You who are the inner self of even *jeevaatman*?

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 42:*** ***Praseeda sarva sarvaatman bhavaaya jagataam imaam |*** ***Uddharorveem mameyaatman sham no dehi abjalochana ||*** O *Paraamaatman*. You are the inner self of everything that exists. Let this world exist, and let it survive. Be pleased, O lotus eyed supreme Lord. Please grant us all auspiciousness, grant us peace, O Lotus eyed Lord. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Praseedeti | Bhaavaaya jagataam iti paathe bhaavaaya sadbhaavaaya   
|*** There is another *paatha * called *bhaavaaya jagataam*. This means for proper existence.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 4, Shloka 46:*** ***Tasya upari jaloughasya mahatee nouriva sthitaa |*** ***Vitatatvaat tu dehasya na mahee yaati samplavam ||*** This *pruthivi * was looking as though a huge ship, placed on that ocean. Because the expanse of the earth was so much, it did not submerge in it.

He created them as earlier.  [[184]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Bhoo vibhaagam iti | Bhooh iti paataalaam api upalakshanam |*** *Bhoo * is *upalakshana * for everything - the *bhoo, bhuvah*, etc., and the *paataalaas*. He also created all the words which are below.

According to the *praacheena karma vaasanaas * of all the individual selves, the creation happens. Whether someone becomes a *deva, manushya, vruksha*, or *pashu*, though *Paramaatman * does creation through *Chaturmukha Brahma*, it is only because of the *praacheena karma vaasanaa * of the individual self; whatever  [[185]] is accumulated over innumerable births, they take on the next birth. This is decided based on the karma, and *Bhagavaan * is only a *nimitta * in the act.

The various creations, differentiation into humans, *devas*, etc. is told as due to the *karma shaktis * only. The individual selves, though they take those forms, and are created like that, the main cause is said to be the karma behind them.

As He started to do *sankalpa * for creation, He did in the same way as done in the previous *kalpaas*.

In this, there is a lot of reference from *Saankhya kaarikaa*, the 47th *kaarikaa*. Five types of *avidyaa * are told - *avidyaa, asmitaa, raaga, **dvesha, abhinivesha*. The effect of this is *tamas, moha, mahaa moha, **taamisra * and *andha taamisra. Tamas * is obscurity, *moha * is delusion, *mahaa **moha * is excessive delusion, *taamisra * is gloom, *andha taamisra* is extreme gloom. They are all synonyms of *avidyaa * only, neiscience.

He was not very much awake. He started to do *sankalpa*, but was not fully awake, so *tamas * was abundant; this is when *vruksha * and others were created. The vegetation - there is no knowledge inside and outside; outside sound and others, and inside *sukha* and *dukha*, knowledge is not there; very minute knowledge is there. That *vruksha*, etc. have little bit of knowledge is well known, because they drink water; and grow a branch which is cut off, there is milk produced from the tree, all this indicates that there is some *jnyaatrutva*. Being enveloped by great *tamas*, they were all created.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 7:*** ***Mukhyaa nagaa yatah proktaa mukhya sargah tatah tvayam ||*** This creation is called *mukhya sarga*, created at the beginning of the creation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Mukhyaa iti | Mukhyaah - tiryak aadi sargasya aadou jaataah |*** First the mountains were formed, then the trees were created. Next come the animals, *manushyaas, devaas*.

putravatvaadi sambandha anabhijnyaah |*** Egotism, due to having the idea of *aatman * in the body, eighteen types of impairment of senses are told in the *Vaayu Puraana *- deafness, defects of the skin, eye defects such a going blind, losing sense of taste, losing sense of smell, dumbness, defects of hands, legs, defects related to rectum, and so on. These are all impairments of the senses. Twenty eight forms of imperfections are 11 types of impairments of the senses, and 17 types of impairment in *buddhi*. Nine types of contentment are four internal \( *aadhyaatimika, prakruti, upaadaana, kaala, bhaagya*\) and five external \( *baahya*\), due to abstinence from sense objects. The nine kinds of *tushti*, contentment are *prakruti, upaadaana, kaala, bhaagya, aarjana, rakshana, **kshaya, sanga, himsaa*. Eight kinds of *siddhi * are *ooha, shabda, adhyayana*, prevention of three kinds of *dukha - aadhyaatmika, aadhibhoutika, **aadhidaivika*, and *suhrutpraapti * and *daana*. There are seventeen types of imperfections of *buddhi*. 



The nine types of contentment are explained thus:  [[194]] яВ╖ If *chitta * is merged into *prakruti*, that itself is *moksha *- thinking like this and feeling happy about it is called *ambhaa*. яВ╖ By just wearing the sings of *sannyaasa*, such as *kaavi * cloth, feeling that one has become a *krutaartha*, and feeling content and not putting any effort to do *upaaya anusthaana* is called *salilaa*. яВ╖ Thinking that anyway, at whatever time *siddhi * will happen, so why worry now, and there is no need to put effort, thinking like this and feeling content is *aapah*, яВ╖ Thinking that *viveka jnyaana * cannot be achieved by any other means, but can only happen due to luck, contentment coming out of such thinking is *vrushti*. The above four are said to be internal forms of contentment. яВ╖ Five external forms of contentment are - contentment arising from abstinence from five sense objects thinking that they are painful. They perceive defects in the process of earning, saving, spending, enjoying, and not being able to stop enjoyment, etc. and do not put any effort for these, and feel contented. This is *tushti*. 



Thinking that why I should earn money, as it is painful to work, and not doing it and feeling happy about it, is *arthasya aarjane viraktih*, called as *sutaara, supaara, sunetra, maareechaka, uttamaambha*. 



Now, the *taaraka aadi ashta siddhayah*. Eight kinds of *siddhi * are *ooha, **shabda, adhyayana*, prevention of three kinds of *dukha *\( *aadhyaatmika, **aadhidaivika, aadhibhoutika\), suhrut praapti, daana*. 



Three kinds of *siddhi * called *dukha vighaata siddhayah *- are the winning over the sorrows caused by three kinds of tapas. 



*Abhigamyaakhyaa siddhih, mitra yoga vishaada artha siddhih *- acquiring friends is *suhrutpraapti*. 



 [[195]] *Vidvat tapasvi shushrooshaa labhyaartha siddhih sadaa pramutidaakhyaa **siddhih*, is called *daana*. 



All these *siddhis*, nine *tushtis*, and impairment of senses, are all obstructions to attaining liberation. 



The eight kinds of *siddhis*, the nine kinds of contentment \( *tushtis*\), the impairment of the senses \( *indriya ashakti*\), are explained in the commentary. These are all called *anugraha srushti*, these are required for the functioning, and they are done for the *abhivruddhi*. One should get this knowledge, and the obstructions, and then win over that, and then attain *moksha*. These are all said to be obstructions to *moksha*; this is told clearly here. 





What happened after creation of the animals comes next. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 12:*** ***Tam api asaadhakam matvaa dhyaayato anyah tato abhavat |*** ***Oordhva srotaah truteeyah tu saatvikordhvam avartata ||*** Again, Brahma started meditating that this is also not sufficient for the prosperity of the earth. One more *srushti * happened. The third creation is called *oordhva srotas*. The upward part is called *saatvika srushti*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's commentary:*** ***Tam iti | Oordhva srotaah asprushta bhoomikaah | Saatviko oordhvam   
iti aarshah sandhih | Ordhvam avartata dyu loke avartata |*** *Oordhva srotah * means upwards, not touching the earth. The gods are not touching the earth. *Saatviko oordhvam * is not according to *vyaakarana*, but  [[196]] it is *aarsha, rishi kruta*, so we have to accept it. In the upper worlds, the *devaas * were created. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 13:*** ***Te sukha preeti bahulaah bahirantah cha na aavrutaah |*** ***Prakaashaa bahirantah cha oordhva srota udbhavaah smrutaah ||*** They had excess of enjoyment of the senses, love, experience of the sense objects. They had very good knowledge. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 14:*** ***Tushta aatmaanah truteeyah tu deva sargah tu sa smrutah |*** ***Tasmin sarge abhavat preetih nishpanne brahmanah tadaa ||*** The third creation is said to be *deva sarga*. Brahma was quite satisfied with that creation of *devaas*, gods. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Ta iti | Sukha preeti bahulaah - vishaya anubhava dashaa sukham, tat   
janitaa nirvruttih preetih | Prakaashaa - prakrushta jnyaanaah,   
jnyaana nirodha rahitaah |*** They had experience of sense objects, the contentment arising out of that is said to be *preeti*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 15:*** ***Tato anyam sa tadaa dadhyou saadhakam sargam uttamam |*** ***Asaadhakaan tu taan jnyaatvaa mukhya sarga aadi sambhavaan ||***  [[197]] He wanted to do one more creation, that which can achieve the purpose properly and well. Not content with the creation of the gods, again he meditated. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tata iti | Mukhya sargah aadih yeshaam sambhavaanaam sargaanaam   
te tathaa uktaah |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 16:*** ***Tathaa abhidhyaayatah tasya satya abhidhyaayinah tatah |*** ***Praadurbabhoova cha avyaktaat arvaak srotaah tu saadhakah ||*** He was *satya sankalpa*, and again He did meditation. Then this *arvaak **srotas * was created, which was sufficient to meet His objective in the creation. It was created from *prakruti*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tathaa iti | Satya abhidhyaayinah sadaa satya sankalpasya avyakta   
aadi iti etat shareera upaadaana pruthivyaadi aapyaayana dvaaraa;

Agnou praastaa aahutih samyak aadityam \* ityaadi prakaarena yajnya   
aadinaa loka saadhakah |*** All the time, He was of true willing, the *shareera * and everything were pleasing for enjoyment, experience; in all creations it was same. In *Vaayu **Puraana*, it is told that it is all created from *avyakta*, body and other things for all the beings are created from modifications of *prakruti*. *Saadhakah * means it was sufficient to meet His objectives. He was happy with that. His main purpose was to make sure that *yajnya, * [[198]] *yaaga * and the *vaidika karmaas * told in the *Vedaas*, are all performed, and the earth will prosper. 



This *arvaak srotas*, which was created in the lower worlds, the *manushyaas * were created, which was sufficient to achieve His purpose. In the Upanishads, it is said that the oblations offered in the Agni will go and reach *Aaditya*. Various *devataas * are offered oblations in the *yaaga*, through the fire. They go and reach those *devataas*, this is told in the *Shruti*. It was possible to offer the *yaagaas*, and the *manushyaas * created were capable of performing these *yaagaas*, and the gods get pleased with this, and give all the boons; in this way, it was possible to perform *yajnyaas*. With this, the world would sustain and prosper. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 17:*** ***Yasmaat arvaak vyavartanta tato arvaak srotasah tu te |*** ***Te cha prakaasha bahulaa tamodriktaa rajodhikaah ||*** They are said to be *arvaak srotasah \(arvaak * is lower\), as they were created in the lower worlds, earth and other worlds.

They were called *manushyaas*, and were able to achieve, perform *yajnya, yaaga*.

The first one is - at the time of *praakruta pralaya*, when *Chaturmukha Brahma * is also not there, at the end of *Chaturmukha **Brahma's * hundred years; the *srushti * that happens after *praakruta pralaya * is said to be *praakruta srushti*, which is *samashti srushti - prakruti, mahat, **ahamkaara, pancha tanmaatraas, pancha bhoota tattvaas * are all said to be *praakruta srushti*. Second part of the *srushti * is after *Chaturmukha **Brahma * is created, from the *pancha bhootaas, **Bhagavaan * does *pancheekarana*, mixing, from where body can be created. Trees, animals, gods, humans, *anugraha * are all created after *Chaturmukha **Brahma * is created - this is said to be *vaikruta srushti*; this happens during *praakruta pralaya * at the beginning of every *kalpa*, every day of *Chaturmukha Brahma * is also *vaikruta* only. One day of *Chaturmukha **Brahma * is said to be a *kalpa*, and after that, he sleeps for one night. At the beginning of every *kalpa*, there is *kalpa srushti. Koumaara * is said to be *praakruta * and *vaikruta. Mahat, tanmaatra, aindriyaka srushti *- this is done by *Paramaatman * when He is existing in His *svaroopa*. Remaining are  [[203]] created by *Chaturmukha Brahma*; being *antaryaami * of *Chaturmukha **Brahma*, He does that.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 26:*** ***Praakrutaa vaikrutaah cha eva jagatah moola hetavah |*** ***Srujato jagadeeshasya kim anyat shrotum icchasi |*** The primary causes of this world are the *praakruta * and *vaikruta * creations. Like this, the Supreme Lord, *Paramaatman*, created all these things. *Parasharar * asks *Maitreya *- what else do you want to know? 



***Recap***: We were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 5, where the various kinds of creation were told briefly. There were eight types of creation told. The initial creations were done by *Paramaatman* directly. Trees, animals, *devaas * and *manushyaas*, then comes *anugraha sarga*. The first one is *mahat * and *ahamkaara*. Then the *tanmaatraas * is the second. *Vaikaarika*, that which undergoes *vikaara, aindriyaka * is the third one. This is the *praakruta sarga*, during *praakruta pralaya*, when even *Chaturmukha **Brahma * gets merged; when everything gets merged and resides in *Paramaatman * with *ekee bhaava. Sthaavaraas * are the fourth one, called *mukhya sarga. Tiryak yonis*, animals, *pashus*, are the fifth one. The sixth one is *oordhva srotas*, gods who live in the upper worlds, who do not touch the earth. Then is the *arvaak srotas*, the humans who live on earth. 



*Mahat, tanmaatraas, aindriyaka*, trees, animals, gods, humans are the seven types. The eighth one is *anugraha sarga, saatvika, taamasa*. Out of these eight, three are said to be *praakruta*. Five are said to be *vaikruta. **Praakruta * means whatever happens after *praakruta pralaya. Vaikruta * means after *Chaturmukha Brahma * is created, whatever is done through *Chaturmukha Brahma * during every *kalpa. Anugraha sarga * is said to be *saatvika * and *taamasa*, impairments to the senses are all *taamasa; **siddhi *\(for *manushyaas*\) and *tushti *\(for *devaas*\), are said to be *saatvika*.  [[204]] 



The ninth type of creation is said to be *koumaara*, which is *praakruta * as well as *vaikruta*. Two are said there - one is *Sanathkumaara * and the *maanasa putraas * of Brahma, and *Neelalohita*, who is *Rudra. Maanasa **putraas * are said to live as long as Brahma's life; they are *praakruta * as well as *vaikruta*. Thus, nine creations were told. 



After *praakruta pralaya*, when *srushti * happens, *Sanathkumara * and others were created. *Rudra srushti * was done by *Chaturmukha Brahma*, at the beginning of every *kalpa*, this is said to be *vaikruta*. Therefore, *koumaara * is said to be *praakruta * and *vaikruta*. 



The three *srushtis*, the *mahat, tanmaatraas * and *aindriyaka * told, is till the creation of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, are directly created by *Paramaatman*, because *Chaturmukha Brahma * is not yet created. The term *Prajaapati * is used to denote Vishnu as well as *Chaturmukha Brahma * also. In the *mahat, **tanmaatraas, aindriyaka * creations which are *praakruta sargaas*, the term *Prajaapati * means *Vishnu * who is Himself present. Others are all created through *Chaturmukha Brahma, Paramaatman * being his *antaryaami*. Here also, *Prajaapati * in the ultimate sense will denote *Paramaatman * only, *Paramaatman * gets the creation done through *Chaturmukha Brahma*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 26:*** ***Praakrutaa vaikrutaah cha eva jagatah moola hetavah |*** ***Srujato jagadeeshasya kim anyat shrotum icchasi |*** The primary causes of this world are the *praakruta * and *vaikruta * creations. Like this, the Supreme Lord, *Paramaatman*, created all these things. *Parasharar * asks *Maitreya *- what else do you want to know? 





 [[205]] *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 27:*** ***Maitreyah:*** ***Sankshepaat kathitah sargo devaadeenaam mune tvayaa |*** ***Vistaraat shrotum icchaami tvatto munivarottama ||*** O Superior among sages. Whatever you said so far briefly, about the creation of *devaas * and others, I would like to listen to it in detail. 



*Paraasharar * explains in detail the creation of all the various beings in each of these categories. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 28:*** ***Sri Paraasharah:*** ***Karmabhih bhaavitaah poorvaih kushalaah kushalaih tu taah |*** ***Khyaatyaa tayaa hi anirmuktaah samhaare hi upasamhrutaah ||*** They are all having those reminiscent impressions of earlier births, they are bound by all this. All the beings are having these reminiscent impressions, due to the *karmaas * which they have performed, in prior births. All actions create reminiscent impressions, in their *jnyaana*. Being associated with those reminiscent impressions, they are bound by them; during *pralaya * they are withdrawn into *Paramaatman*.

As he started creation, children were born from his mind. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Sthaavaraantaah iti | Atah karma bhedaat chaturviddhyam prajaanaam

To start with, those who are born from his mind, is going to be told.

Those who have excess of *tamo guna*, were created. They were called *asuraas*, demons; they were born from the lower part of the body. 



*Srashtum icchuh sisrukshuh | *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 32:*** ***Utsasarja tatah taam tu tamo maatraatmikaam tanum |*** ***Saa tu tyaktaa tanuh tena maitreya abhoot vibhaavaree ||*** That body which was having excess of *tamo guna*, he gave up that body. That body which was given up by him, that body became night, as it had *tamo guna praachurya*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yukta aatmanah iti | Tamo maatraa tamo guna amshah |*** 



He got a body which had a lot of *tamo guna*, and created the *asuraas * from his *jaghana*; he then left that body, and it became night. 





 [[208]] *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 33:*** ***Sisrukshuh anya dehasthah preetim aapa tatah suraah |*** ***Sattvodriktaah samudbhootaah mukhato brahmano dvija ||*** He wanted to create again, and so he took another body. Having left the *taamasa * body, he took a *saatvika deha*. The gods who were having excess of *sattva guna*, they were born out of this, from the mouth. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 34:*** ***Tyaktaa so api tanuh tena sattvapraayam abhoot dinam |*** ***Tato hi balino raatrou asuraa devataa divaa ||*** He gave up this body also, this body became the day.

That body, which had *rajo guna*, became *jyotsnaa*. 



*Sandhyaa * is the later part of the day before night. *Jyotsnaa * is the earlier part of the day. We have *jyotsnaa*, then day, then *sandhyaa*, then night.

Those who said like this became *raakshasaas*. Those others who said that let us eat him up, because they want to eat all the time, they were called *yakshaas*. 



*Raakshaasaas * means not those who are bad, they are those who wanted to protect *Chaturmukha Brahma*.

Whatever *karmaas* they had done in their earlier creations, according to that, they have to experience the results of all those *karmaas*, the fruits of those *karmaas - punya * or *paapa *- which have accumulated in innumerable earlier births, according to this, again and again they get different types of bodies, and are born as all these different types told here. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[220]] ***Tat iti | Evam srujyamaanaanaam praaninaam gunaakaara   
svabhaavaah tat karma anugunyena brahmanaa srujyante, na tu   
svaatantreyena iti aaha teshaam iti |*** Though it is told in the earlier *shlokaas * that he created out of his own freedom, he did not independently create according to his will. This is all decided based on the *poorva janma karmaas * of those beings. He is without any partiality. Their qualities, attributes, forms, their nature, are done according to their *karmaas * only. He has no freedom in creating what he wants; he creates according to their earlier *karmaas*. 



The last few *shlokaas * of this chapter tell a lot of *tattva*. We shall these take up in the next class. 



We studied the different classifications, subdivisions, different types of beings created. Also the various *chandas, saamas*, the various Veda *bhaagaas, stotraas, yajnyaas*. We have to understand that the *Veda **bhaagaas * are not created newly every time, but again and again taught by *Parabrahman*, to *Chaturmukha Brahma*. He teaches and gives the powers to some *rishis * to do *saakshatkaara*. The *Vedaas * are *apourusheya * and *nitya*. All the beings get associated with various bodies according to their *karmaas*. 



***Recap***: We were studying *Amsha* 1, Chapter 5, where we studied the various varieties of beings created by *Brahma*. He created the various immovables and movables, the *naraas, kinnaraas*, demons, birds, animals, deer, the variety of beings. Whatever *karmaas * the sentient beings had accumulated, came the various births. From beginningless time, the sentient beings have been engaged in all kinds of work, and accumulating *punya * and *paapa*, the result of various *karmaas * done. All the time, they are engaged in doing something or the other - *Na hi kaschit kshanam api jaatu tishthati **akarmakrut*, he cannot be without doing something even for a fraction of a second. According to these *karmaas, Brahma*, during creation, gives the  [[221]] various bodies, as *nara, kinnara*, demons, birds, animals, etc. The Lord, one who creates in the beginning, *Bhagavaan*, created everything according to each one's previous *karmaas*. Again and again when they are getting created, they engage in various kinds of work, and accumulate virtues or sins, and they have to experience these; they again get different births; they are getting into this cycle of births and deaths again and again, 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 61:*** ***Himsraa ahimsre mrudu kroore dharma adharmou ruta anrute |*** ***Tat bhaavitaah prapadyante tasmaat tat tasya rochate ||*** These are the various contradicting qualities which they get, in their births - cruel nature, or not having that cruel nature, being of good nature, soft or tough natured, they follow the virtuous path, or keep doing sins, truth and false. Being controlled by these *karmaas*, the reminiscent impressions accumulated in the previous births, they get the births accordingly, and their nature will be according to this, they act accordingly, and the impressions continue. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Himsre iti | Tat bhaavitaah - taih himsraadibhih, karmabhih vaasitaah,   
himsra kathina anrutaani ahimsra mrudu satyaani cha mano vaak kaaya   
karmaani pratipadyante | Tat janya dharma adharmou cha yena   
vaasitou yah yat karoti tat tasmai rochate |*** These are said to be the acts of body, speech and mind. Being cruel natured means causing bodily injuries. Or telling harsh words, or speaking lies. Or not injuring anyone, being soft natured by mind, and speaking the truth. They do the various activities of body, speech, mind, according to their nature. According to these qualities, their nature, whatever *dharma * or *adharma* are there, good and bad deeds, they are driven by those impressions, they will engage in those acts, and this will be appealing to them; they would like to do only that. One who has the  [[222]] tendency, from previous reminiscent impressions, to speak the truth all the time, they will engage in virtuous acts, and this will only appeal to them; they would want to do more and more of that. They are born, already having inherited these characteristics, this is their nature from the previous *karmaas*, due to reminiscent impressions, those acts will be appealing to them.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 62:*** ***Indriyaartheshu bhooteshu shareereshu cha sa prabhuh | *** ***Naanaatvam viniyogam cha dhaataivam vyasrujat svayam ||*** The multitude seen in the sense objects, sound, smell etc. in the organs of hearing, etc. - this is the variety in sense objects; the various places of experience - the earth, oceans, heavens, etc. - this is the variety in *bhootaas*, and bodies; the place where they experience, the bodies which they take, two legged or four legged bodies, where the sentient beings, individual selves reside and experience all of these; in various places like the earth, ocean, etc., using various sense organs and objects of the senses - this is the variety that is told in them. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Indriyaartheshu iti | Indriyeshu tat artheshu cha naanaatvam   
shrotraaditva shabdaaditva vibhaagam, bhooteshu naanaatvam, bhoo

He creates all these things independently. There is one more *paathaantara * with the same meaning. 





This is a very important *pramaana * used in our *aachaaryaa's * works. The establish the *Veda Nityatva*, eternity and impersonality of the *Vedaas*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 63:*** ***Naama roopam cha bhootaanaam krutyaanaam cha prapanchanam |*** ***Veda shabdebhyah eva aadou devaadeenaam chakaara sah ||*** The names of the various beings, starting with *deva*, up to the immovables, the four kinds of creations, *deva, manushya, tiryak, sthaavara *- their names like *sura *\(gods\), *nara *\(humans\), *mruga *\(animals\), *khaga *\(birds\), *vruksha *\(trees\), the name of their class, is called *naama*. The form is that they do not blink \(for gods\), being two legged \(humans\), being four legged \(animals\), having branches \(trees\), is the *roopa*. The acts that they do are enjoying the *havis * which is offered during sacrifices \(gods\), performance of the sacrifices \(humans\), being the material cause of the sacrifices like the *sruk*, ladle, spoon, *darvi, upadarvi*, \(from trees, leaves, etc.\) - these are all the functions of these classes. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Naama iti | Devaadi sthaavara antaanaam bhootaanaam naama sura   
nara mruga khaga vrukshaadi jaati abhidhaanam, roopam animesha   
dvipada chatushpada shaakhitva aadi, krutyam havirbhoga yajnya aadi   
anusthaana sruk chamasa aadi upaadaanatva aadikam \* Aindram dadhi   
\* Braahmano agninaa dadheeta \* Khaadiram yoopam dhruvam kurveeta   
\* ityaadi veda shabdebhyah eva jnyaatvaa nirmame |*** It is told in the *Vedaas*, that the *havis * offered to Indra is curd. For *yajnya*, the *braahmana * has to bring *agni * and offer the *havis*. The *stambha * for the sacrifice is made from *khaadira * wood. Knowing all these from  [[224]] the *Vedic * words, only, he created all these things. Creation was done through understanding of the *Vedic * words. 



The Supreme Lord, *Paramaatman*, teaches *Vedaas * to *Chaturmukha Brahma*. This is further taught in the *aachaarya - shishya paramparaa*, the lineage. He also gives certain sages the powers based on their *karmaas*, to directly perceive the various parts of the *Vedaas*, through tapas. The Veda parts are revealed to them directly. The *Veda shabda * is eternal, present always, and is pronounced in the same order all the time in every *kalpa*, every *srushti*. This order is called *krama*. The same words are used. The *Veda **shabdaas * indicate the nature of these objects. The characteristics of everything - like *Indra, dadhi*, etc. are told in the *Vedaas. Chaturmukha **Brahma * will create seeing the *Vedic * words. One *chetana * with the right *karma * will be created as *Indra*, with this form and name; and that *chetana * will be called as *Indra*. Similarly, the object with the material cause, called curd is created, and is given name and form. This word *dadhi * is already present in the *Vedaas. Chaturmukha Brahma * knows the word *dadhi*, and he creates the object and gives it the name. All the *devaas * are created like this. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 64:*** ***Rishinaam naamadheyaani yathaa veda shrutaani vai |*** ***Tathaa niyoga yogyaani hi anyeshaam api so akarot ||*** Even the names of the various sages, *rishis, Vasishta * and others; he creates one sage as *Vasishta*, another with that kind of *karma * as *Vishvaamitra*, even others like *Indra, Varuna, Agni, Vaayu*, according to their *karmaas, **Harischandra*, every individual being, the names are already present; the individual object is created according to that form, based on the words present in the *Vedaas*, and they are given those names. A new boy is born, and is given the name *Devadatta*; and *Devadatta * indicates that person. During creation, the words are present already; the name is not given after creation of the object. The name is already present in the *Vedaas*, the  [[225]] object is created and named so. Their functioning also, as in Indra is supposed to function like this, these are his capabilities, these are his activities; according to this, whatever he is supposed to do, and the roles like *adhvaryu *\(one who performs the sacrifice\), *yajamaana *\(the owner of the sacrifice, who gets the sacrifice performed through *adhvaryu*\), etc., these are already known in the *Vedaas*, and are created accordingly. Similarly for *samraat*. He creates whatever is told in the Vedaas. 



Will different souls get different *rishi's * names in the next creation cycle? This will come in the next *shloka*. They are said to be *pravaaha nitya*; someone is always present in this. Different individual selves will be there at different times. It is like the Chief Minister. This name and role is always present, but the individual performing this role differs from time to time. *Vasishta * and *Vishvaamitra * are all like this. There is never a period when there is no *Vasishta*. Only during *praakruta pralaya*, everyone is merged into *Paramaatman*; there is no name and form differentiation. This is a cycle which keeps repeating. They are called *pravaaha nitya*, eternal as a continuous stream. There is one person always in the role as *Vasishta*. But the individual self who is there as *Vasishta * will differ. Once that person's karma finishes, he may go to *moksha*, or may come back to perform various *yaagaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kincha rishinaam iti | Rishinaam vasishtaadeenaam, anyeshaam - indra   
harischandra aadeenaam cha tat tat loka yaatraa niyuktaanaam tat tat   
kriya upaadhikam naam adhvaryu yajamaana samraat aadikam cha,   
veda krutam veda shrutam eva tatra tatra sanketitavaan | Vasishta   
indra aadi vyakteenaam anityatve api tat tat pravaahasya nityatvaat   
tat tat naamnaam vreehi aadi padaanaam iva shroutatva nityatva   
upapattih |*** The individual selves are not eternal, they stay in that position according to karma. After that, they go and someone else comes there. The stream of  [[226]] selves occupying that role are eternal. Just like the word *vreehi*, which stands for grain, is the same in all *kalpaas*, though the same grain will not be there, this is so. So, it is reasonable to say that they are eternal like a continuous stream of individual selves occupying that role. 



In *Brahma Sutraas*, the *Veda Nityatva * and *Pravaaha Nityatva * are answered in three *Brahma Sutraas. Samaana naama roopatvaat ... Naama roopa * is similar, but the person is not the same. Again and again, different people occupy; their name, form and characteristics are the same, but the individual selves are different. 





Now, an example is given. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 65:*** ***Yathaa ruthushu rutu lingaani naana roopaani paryaye |*** ***Drushyante taani taani eva tathaa bhaavaa yugaadishu ||*** The signs of the various seasons, happen all the time in the same way. The cycle repeats. In the summer season, the same kinds of things happen every year. Same with the winter season. Different forms are there, and keep repeating all the time with the same signs. In the same way, in every *yuga*, the same thing keeps repeating in the same way. 



We may not see the same mango tree the next year. There may be a new mango tree. But we see a mango tree every year. Same with every *kalpa*. At the end of every *kalpa*, some worlds get dissolved, not everything. However, during *praakruta pralaya*, everything gets dissolved, and Supreme Brahman creates as it was earlier. The activities and all are repeating in the same way. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[227]] ***Pravaaha nityatvam drushtaantena dhrudayati yathaa iti | Rutu   
lingaani pushpa phala aadeeni, paryaye punaraavruttou, taani taani   
tat tat jaateeyaani eva, yugaadishu yuga kalpa aadi aavruttishu |*** How the *pravaaha nityatva * is being established is made firm through an example. Fruits, flowers, when the same season comes next year, a mango fruit, in the next season also will come; in the same way, in every *yuga * and *kalpa*, they keep repeating. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 66:*** ***Karoti evam vidhaam srushtim kalpaadou sa punah punah |*** ***Sisrukshaa shakti yukto asou srujya shakti prachoditah ||*** In the beginning of the *kalpa*, again and again the same kind of creation is made by *Chaturmukha Brahma. Paramaatman * being his *antaryaami * gets it done. The desire to create, and having the capability to create, being endowed with both, *Chaturmukha Brahma * creates according to the karma of those who are going to be created. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Karoti iti | Sisrukshaa shakti yuktah - srushti shaktibhyaam yuktah |   
Srujya shaktih karma |***

It is told that only *traivarnikaas * have the right to perform *yajnya*. How is it that *shoodraas * are also told as *yajnya saadhana*, this is explained below.

So far, it was told that people were created, and divided into four classes. And that they were established in their duties of station in life. That all four classes are needed for the performance of the sacrifices. That they were always established in performance of obligatory duties, and also not performing what is prohibited. And having pure mind, having established in good conduct. And performing the *karmaas * as *karma yoga*, without any desire in fruits, without the idea of 'I am doing, this is mine'. 



From now on, what happened after some time is going to be told. How the time passed and it deteriorated further, is going to be told. *Bhagavaan * is also told to be *kaalaatmaka*.

Offering our *pranaamans * to the great *aachaarya * and seeking his *divya **anugraha*, we shall resume our session of *Sri Vishnu Puraana*. 



\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 
***Recap***: We were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 6, 


where *Parabrahman * through *Chaturmukha Brahma * created *yajnyaas * and  [[235]] classified people into four classes, *varnaas*, who can all involve in performance of the yajnyaas, to please the gods and get benefits as desired. The gods would bestow all good to those who worshipped through *yajnyaas*, and also make sure that there are good amount of rains. All four *varnaas * were involved in the performance of *yajnyaas*, which is very important for sustenance and prosperity of this whole world. People performing their ordained duties as per their *varna * and *aashrama*, duties of their respective stations in life, is also told in the *Bhagavad Geetha *- *Saha yajnyaih prajaah srushtvaa uraa uvaacha prajaapatih | * *Anena prasavishyadhvam eshavo tu ishta kaamadhuk || * *Devaan bhaavayataanena te devaah bhaavayantu vah | * *Parasparam bhaavayantah shreyah param avaapsyatha ||* *Ishtaan bhogaan hi vo devaah daasyante yajnya bhaavitaah |* Performing the *varna aashrama dharmaas*, the people who are living a pure sin free life, their minds became pure by performance of *karma, karma **anusthaana*, as what was told in the *shaastraas*. Performing like this, they can even attain *Paramaatman*, they can perceive *Bhagavaan*, who is their inner self, *antaryaami*. 



They had no sufferings, and they were living in good places which they liked. They were keeping themselves pure with *snaana * and other things ordained in the *shaastraas*. Their minds were also pure through *karma **anusthaana*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 13:*** ***Shuddhe cha taasaam manasi shuddhe antah samsthite harou |*** ***Shuddha jnyaanam prapashyanti vishnvaakhyam yena tat padam ||***  [[236]] They realize Vishnu who is *Paramaatman*, who is *shuddha jnyaana svaroopa*, this is how life was going on in the *Kruta yuga*. 



Then the *Treta yoga * started. Then the effect of *kaala*, which is also an *amsha * of *Paramaatman*, which is *Paramaatman's shareera*, came. *Kaala * brought in lot of change, there was deterioration in the standard of living, this is being told now. *Kaala * is a *dravya * in our *siddhaanta*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 14:*** ***Tatah kaalaatmako yo asou sa cha amshah kathito hareh |*** ***Sa paatayatyagham ghoram alpam alpa alpa saaravat ||*** After the starting of *Treta yuga, Kaala*, controlled and supported by *Paramaatman*, and used by *Paramaatman * for *pravartana * of this *samsaara **chakra*, that *amsha * of *Paramaatman * started to become active. It brought in a lot of grief, *dukha*, and had very little *sukha*. There was lot of grief, sorrow in the lives. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tata iti | Tatah tretaamukhaantaram | Alpam alpa alpa saaravat iti   
paathe alpam udbhootam jaatam alpa alpa saaravat ati alpa sukham,   
ghoram bahu dukham |*** 



People started to suffer a lot, and there was hardly any happiness in their lives. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 15:*** ***Adharma beejam udbhootam tamo lobha samudbhavam |***  [[237]] ***Prajaasu taasu maitreya raagaadikam asaadhakam ||*** The cause of *adharma*, which causes *krodha, lobha*; people had ignorance, desire, passion - these things started to sprout in the minds of people, which is the cause of *adharma*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Adharma iti | Adharma beejam adharmasya kaaranam, tamah krodha

raaga aadikam, ayam kaalah prajaasu paatayati kshipati iti poorvena   
anvayah | Adharma beejam udbhootam iti cha paathah |*** Passion about the various sense objects, which made them not capable of attaining the eight *siddhis * which are told. 



In the *Kruta yuga*, the attainment of *siddhis * was very natural to people. In the *Treta yuga*, this became difficult for people. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 16: *** ***Tatah saa sahajaa siddhih taasaam naateeva jaayate |*** ***Rasollasa aadayah cha anyaah siddhayoh ashtou bhavanti yaah ||*** The *siddhi * which was natural to them during the *Kruta yuga*, they were not able to attain that during *Treta yuga*. They were not able to attain those eight *siddhis*.

bhoomitvam iti, puraaneshu ashta siddhayo bahudhaa uktaah |*** In *Kruta yuga*, there were eight *siddhis * told - *mithunotpatti, rasollaasa, **sakrut vrushtimayee siddhi, gruha vrukshaatmikaa siddhi, sankalpa siddhi, **kalpa vrukshaatmikaa siddhi, prakaama vrushti siddhi, akrushta pachya **siddhi*. This was naturally possible for people in *Kruta yuga*. 



1. *Rasollaasa * is when *amruta * is supposed to flow from the *chandra bimba*, through *moordhanya naadi * for *yogis*, and with that, *yogis * never feel hunger. Winning over hunger through continuous practice of yoga is *rasollaasa **siddhi*; the various things required to satiate hunger are produced automatically inside the body. 2. *Mithunotpatti * is when *yogis * who attain such *siddhi * were able to get all kinds of joy by themselves. They were in bliss by themselves without the need for anything else. They had freedom from sensual desires. This is told in *Skanda * and *Koorma Puraanaas*. 3. The third *siddhi * is *sakrut vrushtimayee*; with just one spell of rain, it was sufficient to bring in all kinds of prosperity needed, and all plants would grow abundantly. 4. The next is *gruha vrukshaatmikaa*. The trees in their houses would bear fruits as and when they desired. 5. The next is *sankalpa siddhi*; just by willing, they could get whatever they wanted to attain.  [[2396]] . *Kalpavruksha aatmikaa * is the next one, as though they have a *kalpa **vruksha * under their control and can get anything by praying to that *kalpa **vruksha*. Just as Sage *Bharadwaaja * treated the entire army of *Bharata*, when *Bharata * wanted to bring back *Sri Raama; **Bharadwaaja * tells *Bharata * that he would like to treat his army with whatever they needed, this is explained wonderfully in *Srimad **Raamaayana*,; he invited all the gods from heaven, and they gave all kinds of food, and they had a wonderful treat never dreamt of. People were able to attain such *siddhi * in *Kruta yuga*. 7. The next is *prakaame vrushtih *- whenever they wanted, they could get rains. 8. *Akrushta pachya * is the next one - without having to do any farming, they could reap all harvest. These eight *siddhis * were naturally possible for people in *Kruta yuga*. As *Treta **yuga * started, things started to deteriorate.

They built themselves, created them artificially. *Pura * is told by *Bhrugu * as: Place of residence of the kings is said to be *puri*, *vishaam* means peoples', their place of residence is said to be *puram*. There will be a village, and after some distance, there will be a city. A mixture of these, would be near the water sources, like rivers or mountains - is said to be *kharvata*. They created for themselves places which were secure and where they could live and get over the effects of dualities of life. They had camps, towns also.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 19: *** ***Gruhaani cha yathaa nyaayam teshu chakruh puraadishu |*** ***Sheeta aatapaadi baadhaanaam prashamaaya mahaamate ||*** They created houses as per *Vaastu shaastra*, in those cities, villages, towns, in order to prevent suffering from cold, heat, etc.

Those plants which were yielding the grains for *yajnya*, they are fourteen in number; they are called *graamyaaranyaa dhaanyaas*, which were also grown.

Once they built their houses to protect themselves from cold, heat and other disturbances, they started to engage themselves in cultivation, manual labour, and they grew the seventeen types of *graamya dhaanyaas*, grains, and the fourteen types useful for performance of the *yajnyaas*. We find many of these names in the *Vedaas * too. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 26: *** ***Graamyaaranyaah smrutaah hi etaah oshadhyah tu chaturdasha |*** ***Yajnya nishpattaye yajnyah tathaa aasaam heturuttamah ||*** The fourteen types of grains are said to be *graamyaaranyaas*, which are used in the performance of *yajnyaas*. These were used for the completion of  [[244]] the *yajnya*, and useful for the growth of the plants. These grains are used for performance of *yajnya*, and *yajnya * in turn is required for growing these plants. *Yajnya * is the best means for growing all these plants and grains. Through *yajnya * only, rains and all this kind of prosperity can be attained; and this will bring in all kind of good in the world. Performance of *yajnyaas * is very important, and for those *yajnyaas*, these grains are useful. Performance of *yajnyaas * becomes a cause of good growth of these plants. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 27: *** ***Etaah cha saha yajnyena prajaanaam kaaranam param |*** ***Paraavaravidah praajnyaah tato yajnyaan vitanvate ||*** Those who are the knowledgeable people of *para, avara *- they always engage in performance of *yajnyaas*. This is also very important for perpetuation of the human race itself. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Graamya iti | Aasaam - oshadheenaam hetuh - vardhakah |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 28: *** ***Ahani ahani anusthaanam yajnyaanaam muni sattama |*** ***Upakaarakaram pumsaam kriyamaana agha shaantidam ||*** When *yajnyaas * are being performed every single day, O excellent of the sages, it is extremely helpful to people. It helps them to get rid of all sins. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[245]] ***Ahani ahani iti | Yajnyaanaam pancha mahaa yajnyaanaam

ityaadinaa sooktam, atra tu poorvam alpa alpasaaravat iti uktam,   
tasya aghasya shaantidam - naashakaram iti arthah |*** The *yajnyaas * are told to be *pancha mahaa yajnyaas - Deva yajnya, Rishi **yajnya, Pitru yajnya, Bhoota yajnya * and *Manushya yajnya*. Performance of *pancha mahaa yajnyaas * every single day helps people to get rid of all kinds of sins. There are many sins which keep accumulating. These will be happening without our knowledge - they are told as *pancha soonaas *- five kinds of sins that we accumulate every day. A householder performs five kinds of sins - \(i\) the hearth for frying, where we kill so many beings, \(ii\) during grinding, \(iii\) sweeping with the broom, \(iv\) making paste, \(v\) heating the water vessel. A *gruhasta* engages in all these every day. We do not know the innumerable invisible number of beings we will be torturing. All these accumulate sins. When we do the *pancha mahaa yajnyaas*, these are said to get rid of these sins - this is told in *Manu Smruti. * *Adhyaapanam brahma yajnyah pitru yajnya tu tarpanam |* *Homo daivo balirbhooto nri yajnyo atithi poojanam ||* *Pancha etaan yo mahaa yajnyaan na haapayati shaktitah |* *Gruhe api vasan nityam soonaa doshaih na lipyate ||* When one performs these *pancha mahaa yajnyaas*, such a person will never be affected by these kind of sins, which are unknowingly performed every single day. 



*Paraasharar * now tells about people who are not interested in performing *yajnyaas * and who always engage in bad deeds. And about the worlds attained by those who are engaged in *pancha mahaa **yajnyaas* and *varna aashrama dharmaas*, and those who are not following the *shaastraas*, and hate the *Vedic * way of life. 



 [[246]] ***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 6 of *Sri **Vishnu Puraanam*. We saw how after the *Treta Yuga * started, after some time, the changes started to happen. The people started to make residences for themselves, being protected properly from heat, light, and sun, and started cultivation for a means of living, and they grew various grains, seventeen of which are told, which are *graamya*. Then there are fourteen types which are used for performance of *yajnyaas*. 



The importance of *yajnyaas * which sustains the cycle of creation, and human race, was told. Those who realize the importance of *yajnyaas*, and those who are knowledgeable about both *para * and *avara*, it is of utmost benefit to humans, and helps in getting rid of all sins. The *pancha mahaa yajnyaas * are meant here. The *pancha mahaa yajnyaas * which are being performed, the *nitya naimittika karmaas*, on a daily basis, through these, the *gruhastaas * get rid of *pancha soonaas*; so these are of great benefit. This is what is ordained, and is to be performed. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 29: *** ***Eshaam tu kaala srushto asou paapa binduh mahaa mune |*** ***Chetassu vavrudhe chakruh te na yajneshu maanasam ||*** O Sage, due to the effect of time, in their minds, the sins were growing, they were always thinking about transgressing the *shaastraas*. They had no inclination to perform the *yajnyaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 30:*** ***Vedaan vedyam tathaa devaan yajnya karma aadikam cha yat |*** ***Tat sarvam nindamaanaah te yajnyavyaasedhakaarinah ||*** Such people who were not inclined to perform *yajnyaas * but were only evil minded, they ridiculed the *Vedaas*, and *yajnya * and other *karmaas * which are  [[247]] known from the *Vedaas * to be performed for various benefits, and the gods who are praised, and offered *havis*, they ridiculed all of these. Thus they became a hindrance to performance of *yajnyaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 31: *** ***Pravrutti maarga vyucchitti kaarino veda nindakaah |*** ***Duraatmaano duraachaaraa babhoovuh kutilaashayaah ||*** Creation is told, the cause of lineage through procreation, they thought that they were the cause of such things, and they ridiculed the *Vedaas*. They were evil minded, of bad conduct, they were going against the *shaastraas*, they became evil minded people. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pravrutti iti | Yajnya pravruttyaa pravruttih - sargah, prajaa sarga iti   
arthah |*** 





Such being the time when there were also people like that who were ridiculing the *Vedaas*, gods, *yajnya, karma*, etc., they were hindrance to performance of *yajnya*, and hence continuation of human race, ... *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 6, Shloka 32: *** ***Samsiddhaayaam tu vaartaayaam prajaah srushtvaa prajaapatih |*** ***Maryaadaam sthaapayaamaasa yathaa sthaanam yathaa gunam ||*** When the means of living such as farming, cultivation, were well established, *Prajaapati * having created all the people, started to establish the rules and guidelines,

Even the gods like *Chandra, Soorya, Chaturmukha Brahma*, they attain their positions, and during *pralaya*, they also get merged into their causes. When  [[253]] the gods themselves are not there, their worlds also will go; they also have a time limit. Even *Chaturmukha Brahma * has a time limit of 100 years. During *praakruta pralaya, Chaturmukha Brahma * and his world get merged into *Paramaatman*; so they are not permanent. Everyone other than the *Bhagavat upaasakaas*, they keep coming back into this world. In *Bhagavad Geetha, Sri Krishna * has told this very clearly, that up to *Chaturmukha Brahma*, all the worlds are impermanent. When they attain those worlds, once their time period is over, they have to come back again. Whereas *Bhagavat upaasakaas * attain *Parama Pada*, and do not return; they escape from *samsaara * forever. 





Having told the various worlds attained by these people, up to *Bhagavat **upaasakaas, prateekopasakaas*, and all those engaged in *nitya naimittika **karmaas, varna aashrama dharmaas*, what are the world attained by those transgressing the *shaastraas*. They attain various types of hell. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 30: ***  [[266]] ***Bodham buddhih tathaa lajjaa vinayam vapuraatmajam |*** ***Vyavasaayama prajajnye vai kshemam shaantih asooyata |*** *Buddhi * gave birth to *Bodha. Lajja * also gave birth to a son called *Vinaya *- this is said to be *shaareero vinayah*, when one is bodily subservient. *Vapu * gave birth to *Vyavasaaya. Shaanti * gave birth to *Kshema*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 31: *** ***Sukham siddhih yashah keertih iti ete dharma soonavah |*** ***Kaamaadratih sutam harsham dharma poutram asooyata ||*** *Siddhi * gave birth to *Sukha*, and *Keerthi * gave birth to *Yashas*. They are all the children of *Dharma*. From *Kaama, Rati * gave birth to *Harsha*, and *Dharma * was grandson. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Bodham iti | Lajjaayaah tu shareero vinayah |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 32: *** ***Himsaa bhaaryaa tu adharmasya tato jajnye tathaa anrutam |*** ***Kanyaa cha nikrutih taabhyaam bhayam narakam eva cha ||*** *Himsaa * became wife of *Adharma*, and from them, a son was born by name *Anruta*, and a daughter by name *Nikruti*. From these two -*Anruta * and *Nikruti, Bhaya * and *Naraka * were born. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[267]] ***Dharma prasangaat adharma sargam aaha - himsaa iti | Tayoh   
adharma himsayoh anrutam nikrutih cha jajnye, taabhyaam nikruti   
anrutaabhyaam maayaa bhayam vedanaa narakam cha jajnye | *** Because the sons of *Dharma * were told, the sons of *Adharma * are also told. These are also the states of mind. In order to do creation, sustenance and dissolution - for creation and sustenance, *dharma* is required; for dissolution, *adharma * is also required. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 33: *** ***Maayaa cha vedanaa chaiva mithunam tu idam etayoh |*** ***Tayoh jajnye atha vai maayaa mrutyum bhoota apahaarinam ||*** *Maayaa * and *Vedanaa * were born as twin daughters. From *Maaya, Bhaya * gave birth to *Mrutyu*, which causes an end to all the beings. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Maayaa iti | Tasmaat etayoh mithuna dvayam, bhayaajjajnya iti

Rourava * is to be taken as *Naraka*. From *Mrutyu, Vyaadhi, Jaraa, Shoka, Trushnaa, Krodha * were born. 



 [[268]] These are all the various sufferings and death. These are the means to cause dissolution. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vedanaa iti | Rouravaat bhayam narakam eva chet uktaat narakaat |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 35: *** ***Dukhottaraah smrutaa hi ete sarve cha adharma lakshanaah |*** ***Naishaam bhaaryaa asti putro vaa te sarve hi oordhvaretasah ||*** They are all of extreme sorrow and suffering. They are all signs of *adharma*. For them, there are no wife or children. They are said to be *oordhvaretas*. 



*Viraktaas, sannyaasis * are told as *oordhvaretas*. Because they do not have wife or children, they are said to be *oordhvaretas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Dukhottaraa iti | Adharma lakshanaah adharmo vamsha moola bhooto

anupaadakaah |*** These - *Vyaadhi, Jaraa, Shoka, Trushnaa, Krodha - adharma * is a sign of their entire *vamsha * itself. The end itself is of extreme sorrow, there is nothing else beyond this; so they are said to be *oordhvaretas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 36: *** ***Roudraani etaani roopaani vishnoh munvaraatmaja |***  [[269]] ***Nitya pralaya hetutvam jagato asya prayaanti vai ||*** These are all the terrific forms of Vishnu, O *Maitreya*. They become the cause of *nitya pralaya * of this world. 



Now, the various kinds of *srushti * and *pralaya * are going to be told. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 37: *** ***Daksho mareechih atrischa bhrugu aadyaascha prajeshvaraah |*** ***Jagati atra mahaa bhaaga nitya sargasya hetavah ||*** *Daksha, Mareechi, Atri, Bhrugu * and these hosts of *prajaapatis*, they are the causes of *nitya sarga*, the everyday creation which is happening. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 38: *** ***Manavo manuputraah cha bhoopah veerya dhanaascha ye |*** ***Sanmaarga nirataah shooraah te nitya sthiti kaarinah ||*** The causes of the *nitya sthiti*, the daily sustenance that happens, are *Manu * and sons of *Manu*, who are the kings, with lot of valour, established in the righteous path, courageous and bold ones. 



Thus, *Paraasharar * explains the various forms of *dharma, adharma*, and how they are causing *nitya sarga, nitya sthiti*. 





Now, *Maitreyar * asks a question. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 39: *** ***Maitreyah -***  [[270]] ***Yeyam nityaa sthitih brahman nitya sargah sthiteritah |*** ***Nitya abhaavah cha teshaam vai svaroopam mama kathyataam ||*** You talked about *nitya sarga, nitya sthiti, nitya pralaya *- daily creation, daily sustenance and daily dissolution. Please tell me their svaroopa, their nature, O knower of *Brahman*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Jeevaanaam srujyatvaadinaa paaratantryaat nitya sargaadou   
hetutvam anupapannam iti aashankyaa tat parihaara bubhutsayaa   
teshaam svaroopam prucchati yeyam iti |*** The people who are told - *Daksha, Mareechi, Manu*, their children - are all created, and will also get destroyed. They are dependent on others to create, and not independent. How are they told to be causes of *nitya sarga*, the daily creation? - this is the doubt that *Maitreyar* gets. In order to get that doubt cleared, he is asking about the nature of *nitya sarga, nitya sthiti, **nitya pralaya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 40: *** ***Sri Paraasharah - *** ***Sarga sthith vinaashaam cha bhagavaan madhusoodanah |*** ***Taistaih roopaih achintyaatmaa karoti avyaahato vibhuh ||*** *Paramaatman * only does all these things - creation, sustenance and destruction, taking on those forms, being the *antaryaami * of *Daksha, **Mareechi, Manu*, his children and *Vyaadhi * and others which were told. *Paramaatman's * forms cannot be thought of by anybody, it is unimaginable. How He is the inner controller of everything, and controls the entire process of creation, sustenance, dissolution, without expecting any other *sahakaari*, being *sahakaari nirapeksha*, one cannot even imagine this. He keeps doing this without any breakage.  [[271]] 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 41: *** ***Naimittikah praakrutikah tathaa eva aatyantiko dvija |*** ***Nityascha sarva bhootaanaam pralayo ayam chaturvidhah ||*** *Paraasharar * tells about four kinds of *pralaya - Naimittika, Praakrutika, **Aayantika, Nitya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 42: *** ***Braahmo naimittikah tatra yacchete jagateepatih |*** ***Prayaati praakrutah chaiva brahmaandam prakrutou layam ||*** *Chaturmukha Brahma * has a day and night, one day is a *kalpa*. After a day, when he sleeps for one night, this is called *naimittika pralaya*. In the night when *Chaturmukha Brahma * sleeps, this is said to be *naimittika pralaya. **Chaturmukha Brahma * also goes into *praakruta pralaya*, when the *brahmaanda * also gets merged in its cause. *Brahmaanda * also gets merged into the *pancha bhootaas, pancha tanmaatraas*, everything becomes *avyakta*, which is merged into *Paramaatman, * in *ekee bhaava *- this is called *praakruta pralaya*, when *Chaturmukha Brahma, Brahmaanda*, everything merges into *moola prakruti*. Process of dissolution is in the reverse order of process of creation. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 43: *** ***Jnyaanaat aatyantikah prokto yoginah paramaatmani |*** ***Nityah sadaiva bhootaanaam yo vinaasho divaanisham ||*** *Aatyantika pralaya * is from *Brahma jnyaana*, through *upaasane, prapatti*, those who get rid of *samsaara * forever. They are told as yogis, who go and join *Paramaatman* in *Parama Pada*. Every day and night, the beings are  [[272]] created and they die - this is happening all the 24 hours on a continuous basis - the beings dying daily is called *Nitya Pralaya*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vishnuh eva sattva aadi shaktyaadhaana dvaaraa taih taih manvaadi   
roopaih sthiti aadi karoti iti pariharati - sargeti | Taih taih -   
manvaadiroopaih | Manvaadayah sattvasthaah, dakshaadayo   
raajasaah, vyaadhyaadayah taamasaah |*** *Vishnu*, through His *shakti * of *sattva, rajas * and *tamas*, through *Manu, **Mareechi, Daksha*, and these forms, He does *srushti, sthiti, pralaya*. When He takes the form of *sattva*, through *Manu * and others, He becomes the cause of sustenance. When He takes the form of *Daksha * and others, being *antaryaami * of those *chetanaas, rajas * is high, and He gets creation done. When *taamasa * is high, He takes the form of *Vyaadhi * and other *chetanaas*, and through them, gets destruction done. 



***Atha nitya pralayasya svaroopam darshayan prasangaat pralayasya   
chaturvidham aaha naimittika ityaadinaa | Naimittika iti | Aatyantika

paramaatmani laye api karma kshaya abhaavaat punarbhavo vidyate |   
Aatyantike tu nisshesha karma avidyaadi naashaat na punarbhava iti   
visheshah |*** In order to tell about *nitya pralaya, Paraasharar * starts to explain about four types of *pralaya * here. There are four *pralayas * told - *Naimittika, **Praakrutika, Aatyantika, Nitya*. In the daily deaths we see, the *jeevaatman * goes and joins into *Paramaatman*, and from body to body; this is called *samsaara, samyak sarati*. During *Naimittika pralaya * also, when *Chaturmukha Brahma * sleeps, they go and join into *Paramaatman*. In *Praakruta pralaya, Chaturmukha Brahma * and *Brahmaanda * also get merged. In all these three *pralayaas*, the *jeevaatman * goes and joins *Paramaatman*, but for the *jeevaatman*, the *karmaas * are still existing and not destroyed completely; so they are again born; when *Praakruta * [[273]] *srushti * happens after *Praakruta pralaya*, they are again born. After *Naimittika pralaya * also, and *nitya pralaya * also, they are born again. In all these *pralayaas*, *karma * is not completely destroyed. Every day in *sushupti*, we go and join *Paramaatman*. When we leave the body to take on another birth, *utkraanti*, also, *jeevaatman * goes and joins *Paramaatman. **Laya * is *ekee bhaava*, and not losing the *svaroopa * of *jeevaatman*; but *jeevaatman * goes and joins *Paramaatman * as though they cannot be differentiated. In all these cases, *karma * is still there and not destroyed completely. In order to experience the fruits of those *karmaas, **punya * and *paapa*, again they are born. Whereas in the case of *Aatyantika **pralaya*, *karma * and *avidyaa * are completely destroyed, and because of this, one is not born again; they go to *Parama Pada * and join *Paramaatman * and are eternally liberated from this *samsaara*. 





Now, about creations are told. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 44: *** ***Prasootih prakruteh yaa tu saa tushtih praakrutaa smrutaa |*** ***Dainandinee tathaa proktaa yaa antara pralayaadanu ||*** After *praakruta pralaya*, again *srushti * happens. This is called *praakruta **srushti. Dainandina stushti * is the *srushti * which happens after *naimittika **pralaya*; whatever *Chaturmukha Brahma * creates after sleeping for his night. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 45: *** ***Bhootaani anudinam yatra jaayante munisattama |*** ***Nitya sargo hi sa proktah puraanaartha vichakshanaih ||*** Those who know the meanings of the *Puraanaas * very well, by them, *nitya **sarga * is told as every day when beings are being born, O Sage. 



 [[274]] Four kinds of *pralaya * were told - *Nitya, Naimittika, Praakruta, Aatyantika*. In the first three, there is *srushti*, whereas in *Aatyantika*, there is no *srushti*, because they are liberated once and for all, and there is no *karma*. So three kinds of *srushti * are told - *Praakruta **srushti * after *praakruta pralaya, dainandina srushti * after *naimittika pralaya, **nitya srushti * is after *nitya pralaya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 46: *** ***Evam sarva shareereshu bhagavaan bhoota bhaavanah |*** ***Samsthitah kurute vishnuh utpatti sthiti samyamaan ||*** All these things happen not being controlled by anyone else, but by *Paramaatman Vishnu * only. *Vishnu * only does these creation, sustenance, dissolution, being present as the inner controller in all the bodies. He is untouched by all these defects. He is endowed with *Shaadgunya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 47: *** ***Srushti sthiti vinaashaanaam shaktayah sarva dehishu |*** ***Vaishnavyah parivartante maitreya aharnisham samaah ||*** *Rajas, sattva * and *tamas shaktis * were told to be the cause of *srushti, sthiti, **laya*, in all these embodied beings. They are all controlled and being done repeatedly by the mere willing, *sankalpa * of Vishnu. It happens daily without break. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 7, Shloka 48: *** ***Gunatrayam ayam hi etat brahman shakti trayam mahat |*** ***Yo atiyaati sa yaatyeva param naavartate punah ||***  [[275]] The three *shaktis * are said to be *guna trayaas, sattva, rajas * and *tamas*. One who crosses over all these effects of *sattva, rajas, tamas*, such *yogis * go and attain *Paramaatman*, and do not come back again. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Srushti iti | Vaishnavyah vishnu sankalpa anuvartinyah shaktayah   
sattvaadyaah, aharnisham sadaa avicchedhena | Sarvo api jano vishnu   
shakti preritah kaala bhedaat vishaya bhedaat cha sargaadi karoti |*** Those which are controlled by the mere willing of Vishnu, all beings are being impelled by *Paramaatman's shakti*. Based on the time and object under consideration, creation, sustenance, destruction happen, being controlled by *Paramaatman Vishnu * only. 



*Paraasharar * talks about four kinds of *pralaya*, and three kinds of *srushti*. Though *Daksha * and *prajaapatis, Manu * and his sons, and *Vyaadhi * and others are all responsible, they are all being controlled by *Vishnu * only, being *antaryaami*. Things are done according to the *karmaas * of the *chetanaas*. Those who cross over the effects of these *guna trayaas, **sattva, rajas, tamas*, they attain *Paramaatman * and are never born again. 



With this, the Seventh Chapter comes to an end.

***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 8, where the *prakarana * where *Rudra * married *Uma * was told. We studied the *Rudra sarga*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Maitreyah chodayati - ksheeraabdhou iti |*** 



*Paraasharar * now starts to answer this. While answering, he starts to tell the nature of *Shridevi, Mahaalakshmi, svaroopa, svabhaava*, and also how *Shree * and *Naaraayana * are ever associated. The *Amruta Mathana **prakarana * will come later.

gatatvam uktam | Iyam cha sarva gataa |*** *Jagat pitaa * is *Vishnu*, the father of the whole world. She is ever associated with Him, and is the mother. They are the father and mother of this whole world. Just like *Vishnu*, She is also eternal. For Her also, just like *Vishnu*, She also manifests, and ends Her *avataaraas*, incarnations, many times. First, She was born as the daughter of *Bhrugu*. After that, *Doorvaasa **Rishi * curses *Indra*, and at that time, She disappears, and again manifests during the churning of the ocean. So, there is no contradiction here. The all pervading *Vishnu*, whatever nature He is, She is also of the same nature. The attributes of *Vishnu * such as all pervasiveness, His essential, substantive nature being of *satyatva, jnyaanatva, anantatva, amalatva, aanandatva*, etc., all the innumerable auspicious qualities of *Vishnu, vaatsalya, **soulabhya, sousheelya*, etc., they are all extended in Her also. Or, *Bhagavaan * is all pervasive in His essential nature itself. She is His *shakti*, and though She is *anu*, She is there everywhere, and can be perceived in all places; She is also all pervasive. 



Here there are some aspects we have to see. *Shrutis*, tell about *Shridevi * and *Vishnu * both. Though they may not express the words *vibhu * and *anu * in some places, they tell that *Naaraayana * is supreme in some places, that *Shridevi * is supreme in other places. An *Upanishadic **vaakya "Ksharam pradhaanam amrutaaksharam harah ksharaatmanou **eeshate deva ekah*" says that *prakruti, pradhaana, avyakta * is *kshara, * [[284]] *chetanaas * are *akshara*, one Lord rules over *chetana * and *achetana*; tells *deva **ekah*, and does not talk about *Shridevi * there. " *Aaneedavaatam svadhaayaa **tadekam*", even during *pralaya*, when nothing exists, there is one *Brahman*, associated with *Shridevi. "Tasya madhye vanhi shikhaa aniyordhvaa **vyavasthitah neelato yata madhyasthaa vidyullekheva bhaasvaraa" * in *Mahaa **Naaraayana Upanishad*, says that *Paramaatman * is present in the heard, and *Shridevi * is also present as a streak of lightning there; *Bhagavaan * is like a dark cloud and *Shridevi * is like lightning. " *Sumajjaani*" tells about *Bhagavaan * who is ever associated with *Shridevi. "Vishvasya bhartree **jagatah pratishthaa, eeshaanaa devi bhuvanasya aadi patni, shraddhayaa **devo devatvam ashnute*", She is the support of the entire world, She rules over the entire world. " *Kum pradhaana eeshvara eeshvari*", She rules over even *Eeshvara*. 



*Paraashara Bhattar * says that " *Shruti * may not tell You in some places clearly, separately, because You are included in Him, You are ever associated with Him". Though they are two, they are told as One, they both rule over everything. 



There are two versions of *Vishnuchitteeya * itself. There is a version published in 1882 at Madras, edited by *Vavilla Anantanarayana Shastri*, and *Vaavilla Ramaswamy Shastri*. There is one more published earlier than 1882 in Telugu at Madras. This has the following commentary " *Yathaa iti **sarvagato vishnuh yathaa yat svabhaavah iyam api tathaa tat svabhaavaa **iti. Vishnoh sarvagatatvam pratyajnyaanaadi svaroopa kalyaana **gunaadeenaam atideshah. Athavaa bhagavaan vibhutvena sarvagatah iyam **cha sarva gataa" - anutva * is not mentioned. Among the followers of *Bhagavad Raamaanuja * also, there is a difference between *Vadagalai * and *Tengalai sampradaayaas*. In *Vadagalai*, they think that *Mahaalakshmi * is *vibhu svaroopa*, and in *Tengalai*, she is told as *anu **svaroopa*. 



 [[285]] Next, *Paraasharar * starts to explain the wonderful relationship of *Naaraayana * and *Mahaalakshmi*, how they both exist together. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 18: *** ***Artho vishnuh iyam vaani neetireshaa nayo harih |*** ***Bodho vishnuriyam buddhih dharmo asou satkriyaa tviyam ||*** *Shridevi * is the word, *vaani, shabda*, and *Bhagavaan * is the meaning, *artha*. They are eternally associated like that. *Shridevi * is *neethi*, and *Hari * is *naya. **Shree * is *buddhi * and *Bhagavaan * is *bodha*. *Dharma * is *Bhagavaan * and *Shree * is *y* *aaga * and others. 



In our *siddhaanta*, the relationship between *shabda * and *artha * is eternal, existing all the time. It is not that someone creates an object and associates a word with that. For example, *Devadatta * is born, and the *naamakarana * is done as *Devadatta*. There is a view that after an object is created only, a word can have a meaning; when there is no object, how can a word have a meaning? It is established in the *Shrutis * that *Bhagavaan * does creation with the words only. " *Veda shabdebhya eva aadou devaadeenaam chakaara sah*" says *Manu. Shruti * says " *Sa bhooriti vyaaharat sa bhuvam asrujata*", He said *Bhoo*, and created the world. " *Yathaa poorvam dhaataa akalpayat*". All these things show that the relationship between word and meaning is that the meaning is *antargata * in the *shabda * itself. They are ever associated and there is no need to associate an object with a word. Words like *Indra * are existing all the time, *apourusheya, nitya*, and the meaning always exists. This is examined in detail in various works. There is always an Indra, they are called *pravaaha nityaas*. During creation, *Bhagavaan * takes the *Veda **shabda*, and looking at the characteristics, associates the object with the word. The meaning is the *svaroopa * of the *shabda * itself. *Bhaashyakaarar * establishes all of this in three *sutraas * of *Brahma Sutraas*. 



 [[286]] This is also the reason why *Kaalidaasa * says ' *Vaagarthou iva sampruktou **vaagartha pratipattaye*'. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tayoh sarvaatmakatvam anapaayitvam cha upapaadayati artha iti |   
Arthah shabda vaachyah, neetih nyaaya shaastram | Nayo nyaayah |   
Buddhih adhyavasaayaatmakam antahkaranam, tat kaaryo nischayo   
bodhah | Satkriyaa yaagaadih | Dharmah tat utpaadyamadrushtam |*** Everything is *ubhaya aatmaka, Bhagavaan * and *Shree * are ever associated. Both are there always. Everything has *Vishnu * and *Lakshmi * as their *aatmaa*; they both together control and support everything, and both together are the masters. Word and meaning have *vaachya vaachaka sambandha, **vaachaka * is the *shabda*, and *vaachya * is the object denoted by the word, this is *artha. Nyaaya * is the way the concepts are presented, the *pancha **avayayava vaakya. Nyaaya shaastra * is that which houses all of these. *Buddhi * is the mind, when it is in the deciding mode, when it is taking a decision. When it is thinking, it is called *chinte*. Like this, there are different *prakaaraas*, modes of the mind. The effect of the deciding mind is the decision itself; the decision taken by such a mind is called *bodha*. *Sat **kriyaa * is all the good deeds told in the *Vedaas*, which is *yaagaas*. From the *yaagaas, adrushta * is born, obtained, which is *Bhagvaan's sankalpa* to bestow various benefits. 



*Aalwaar * also says this in many places.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 19: *** ***Srashtaa vishnuriyam srushtih shreeh bhoomih bhoodharo harih |*** ***Santosho bhagavaan lakshmeeh tushtih maitreya shaashvatee ||*** The creator is *Vishnu*, and She is the creation. *Shree * is *bhoomi*, and He is the one who supports the *bhoomi*. O *Maitreya*, The idea of enoughness  [[287]] is *tushti*. The happiness that arises out of this, is *santosha. **Bhagavaan * is *santosha*, and *Lakshmi * is *tushti*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Srashataa iti | Alam buddhih tushtih | Tat abhivyaktam sukham   
santoshah, shaashvatee iti lakshmyaa visheshanam |*** *Shaashvati * is the attribute of *Lakshmi*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 20: *** ***Icchaa shreeh bhagavaan kaamo yajnyo asou dakshinaa tviyam |*** ***Aajyaahutih asou devee purodaasho janaardanah ||*** *Shree * is *icchaa*, and *Bhagavaan * is *Kaama*. If *Vishnu * is *yajnya*, She is *dakshinaa*, donation given during the *yajnyaas*. Every *yajnya * is never complete without *dakshinaa. Shree * is the *aajyaahuti*, the ghee which is offered as oblation, and *Janaardana * is the *purodaasha*, the rice cake which is offered. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Icchaa iti | Icchaa apekshaa, tat janyo abhiniveshah kaamah |*** *Icchaa * is desire, and out of this, comes the wanting to attain that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 21: *** ***Patneeshaalaa mune lakshmeeh praagvamsho madhusoodanah |*** ***Chitih lakshmeeh harih yoopa idhmaa shreeh bhagavaan kushah ||*** *Lakshmi * is the *patneeshaalaa*, the place where the women folk sit, and *Madhusoodana * is the *praagvamsha*, the front portion where  [[288]] the *yajamaana * sits. She is the altar, and *Bhagavaan * is the *yoopastambha*. If *Bhagavaan * is *darbhaa*, She is like the *samit*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Patneeshaalaa iti | Idhmaa samit | Aarshatvaat taap |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 22: *** ***Saama svaroopi bhagavaan udgeetih kamalaalayaa |*** ***Svaahaa lakshmeeh jagannaatho vaasudevo hutaashanah ||*** *Bhagavaan * is *saama svaroopa * itself. She is a special type of that *saama*. If *Vaasudeva * is like the *Agni*, She is like the *Svaaha Devi*, who is wife of *Hutaashana, Agni*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Saama svaroopi iti | Sagaano mantrah saama, tat gaana vishesha   
udgeetih |*** *Saama * is *mantraas * which are sung. A special type of such *saama * is called as *udgeeti*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 23: *** ***Shankaro bhagavaanchourih gouri lakshmeeh dvijottama |*** ***Maitreya keshavah sooryah tat prabhaa kamalaalayaa ||*** If He is like *Shankara*, She is like *Gowri*. If *Keshava * is the Sun, the Sun's brightness is *Lakshmi*. 



 [[289]] There is *prabhaa * and *prabhaavat; prabhaavat * is the *Soorya*, and *prabhaa * is the rays emanating from the Sun. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 24: *** ***Vishnuh pitruganah padmaa svadhaa shaashvata pushtidhaa |*** ***Dyou shreeh sarvaatmako vishnuh avakaasho ati vistatarah ||*** *Vishnu * is like the *pitru gana*, the host of *pitrus*; and She is *Svadhaa*, which gives *pushti * all the time, *nitya pushti*. If She is like the sky, He is the broad space. 



For *pitrus*, when we offer, it is called *svadhaa*. For *devaas*, it is *svaahaa*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 25:*** ***Shashaankah shreedharah kaantih shreeh tatha eva anapaayinee |*** ***Dhrutih lakshmeeh jagat cheshtaa vaayuh sarvatrago harih ||*** *Shreedhara * is the Moon, and the brightness of the Moon is *Shridevi*. She is the capability to support. The *Vaayu * is said to be *Bhagavaan*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Shashaanka iti | Vaayuh jagat praanah, dhrutih dhaaranam, jagat   
cheshtaa cha pravahaadi praanaadi roopa vaayu krutyam |*** *Vaayu * is the *jagat praana*, the life of the entire world. Air carries things with it, and gives life to beings through breathing - *praana, apaana, vyaana, **udaana, samaana *- these are the effects of *Vaayu*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 26:***  [[290]] ***Jaladhih dvija govindah tat velaa shreeh mahaa mune |*** ***Lakshmeeh svaroopam indraanee devendro madhusoodanah ||*** *Govinda * is like the ocean. *Shree * is said to be the shores. If *Madhusoodana * is like *Devendra*, then *Lakshmi * is like *Indraani*, the wife of *Devendra*. 



There is a *paatha * that *Shree * is the tide. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 27:*** ***Yamah chakradharah saakshaat dhoomornaa kamalaalayaa |*** ***Ruddhih shreeh shreedharo devah svayameva dhaneshvarah ||*** If He is *Yama * himself, She is the wife of *Yama, Dhoomornaa*. Lord *Vishnu * is *Kubera*, and She is *Kubera's * wife, *Ruddhi*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yama iti | Yamasya patni dhoomornaa | Ruddhih kuberasya |*** *Dhoomornaa * is the wife of *Yama. Ruddhi * is *Kubera's * wife. 



It can also be taken as *Bhagavaan * being *antaryaami * to all of these. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 28:*** ***Gouri lakshmi mahaabhaaga keshavo varunah svayam |*** ***Shreeh devasenaa viprendra devasenaa patih harih ||*** If *Keshava * is like *Varuna, Lakshmi * is like *Varuna's * wife, *Gowri*. if *Shree * is *Devasenaa, Vishnu* is *Skanda*.  [[291]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Gowri iti | Gowri varunasya patni | Devasenaa skanda bhaaryaa |*** *Varuna's * wife is *Gowri. Skanda's * wife is *Devasenaa*. 



*Tayoh sarvaatmakatvam * is told. They are told in *saamaanaadhikaranya * to be those things. *Varuna * is *Keshavaatmaka. Gowri * is *Lakshmyaatmikaa. * Both are *ubhayaatmaka*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 29:*** ***Avashtambho gadaa panih shaktih lakshmeeh dvijottama |*** ***Kaashthaa lakshmeeh nimesho asou muhoorto asou kalaa tu iyam ||*** If *Bhagavaan * is like the *aadhaara, Lakshmi * becomes the power itself. One *kaashtaa * is fifteen *nimeshaas*. Similarly, *kalaa * is part of *muhoorta*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Avashtambha iti | Avashtambhah aadhaaro balam vaa |*** *Avashtambha * is support or power. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 30:*** ***Jyotsnaa lakshmeeh pradeepo asou sarvah sarveshvaro harih |*** ***Lathaa bhootaa jaganmaataa shreeh vishnuh druma sanjnitah ||*** If the light is *Bhagavaan*, brightness is *Lakshmi*. If *Bhagavaan * is the tree, She is the twiner.  [[292]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Jyotsnaa iti | Jyotsnaa prabhaa |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 31:*** ***Vibhaavari shreeh devo asou devah chakra gadaadharah |*** ***Varaprado varo vishnuh vadhooh padma vanaalayaa ||*** They are associated like night and day. He is the bridegroom, who gives all boons. *Mahaalakshmi * is like the bride. 



There is another *paatha, Vibhaavari shree divaso ... * 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 32:*** ***Nada svaroopi bhagavaan shreeh nadee roopa samsthitaa |*** ***Dhvajah cha pundareekaakshah pataakaa kamalaalayaa ||*** She is *nadi*, and He is *nada*. He is the flag, and She is the banner. 



*Nada * is the masculine gender of *nadi*. In the rivers also, it is told like that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 33:*** ***Trushnaa lakshmeeh jagannaatho lobho naaraayanah parah |*** ***Rathee raagascha maitreya lakshmeeh govinda eva cha ||*** *Trushnaa * is *Lakshmi*, and *Jagannaatha * is *lobha. Rathi * is *Lakshmi*, and *raaga * is *Govinda*.  [[293]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Trushnaa iti | Deyasya aaditsaa nishiddha lipsaa cha lobhah | Labdheh   
aparyaaptadheeh trushnaa | Ratih priya sangamajaa tat kaala preetih;   
tat prakarsho raagah |*** Not being satisfied with whatever one gets is *trushnaa*; they want more and more all the time. Whatever is given in donation, wanting to possess that; and desiring to attain what is prohibited; is *lobha*. The happiness that arises out of union with the dear one, is *rathi*; and the excess of that is *raaga*. 





After telling how they are both associated, and how they are *ubhaya **aatmaka, Paraasharar * says. It is difficult to understand this aspect of Vishnu and Lakshmi being ever associated inseparably, was explained by so many examples. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 34:*** ***Kim cha atra bahunoktena sankshepena idam uchyate ||*** What else can I say, I cannot explain the relationship how they exist, I am telling you very briefly. 



There are two aspects of all that is told. That they are the inner controllers of everything, and are inseparably ever associated. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 8, Shloka 35:*** ***Deva tiryak manushy\(eshu\)aadou punnaamaa bhagavaan harih |*** ***Stree naamnee shreeh cha vijneyaa naanayoh vardhate param ||***  [[294]] In all these creations of gods, animal, human, all movables and immovables, whatever is told as man, male, is all *Bhagavaan*. Whatever is feminine, are *Shridevi's amsha*. There is nothing superior than these two. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Deva iti | Anayoh aabhyaam param anyat | Sarvasya ubhayaatmakatve   
api tatra tatra aabhimukhya atishaya visheshaat arthavaani   
aadeenaam tat aatmakatvam uktam |*** Why only so few examples like *artha, vaani*, etc. Everything has these two as their inner selves, in some places there is a special presence of them that is seen. That was only told here. These are all the examples where this relationship is significantly seen. The examples were told only in specific places, though they are inner controller of everything, and there is nothing superior to them.

Here comes the *prakarana * if *Durvaasa Muni * and *Indra*, and the churning of the ocean comes after this. 



 [[295]] *Maitreyar * had asked about *Shridevi*, Her nature, and how She was also born as daughter of *Bhrugu * and *Khyaati * and also manifests during *Amrutha **Mathana*. Now, *Paraasharar * starts to explain the second part of it.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 1:*** ***Sri Paraasharah -*** ***Idam cha shrunu maitreya yat prushto aham iha tvayaa |*** ***Shree sambandham mayaa api etat shrutam aaseet mareechitah ||*** O *Maitreya*, listen to this also, I am going to tell you more, which is connected to *Shridevi*, which I heard from *Mareechi*.

He saw a wonderful divine garland, in the hand of a *Vidyaadhara stree*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[296]] ***Doorvaasaah iti | Shankarasya amsha iti vakshyamaanaa   
akshyaantyaadeh hetu nirdeshah |*** *Durvaasa * is very intolerant, *akshaanti*. He curses people for the slightest of mistakes, as well known in the *Puraanaas*. The cause of the *akshaanti * is said that he is *amsha * of *Shankara*, as *Shankara * also is said to be like that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 3:*** ***Santaanakaanaam akhilam yasyaa gandhena vaasitam |*** ***Ati sevyam abhoot brahman tat vanam vanachaarinaam ||*** It had the wonderful perfume of the flowers of *Santaanaka*. With this, the entire forest was having a wonderful fragrance of these flowers, which was most pleasant. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 4:*** ***Unmatta vrata dhruk viprah taam drushtvaa shobhanaam srajam |*** ***Taam yathaache varaarohaam vidyaadhara vadhoom tatah ||*** *Durvaasa Rushi * was highly attracted by that garland. He was following the *vrata * of behaving like an *unmatta*, inebriated. He begged her to give him that garland. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Unmatta iti | Unmatta vrata dhruk | Yogino hi jada unmatta   
pishaachavat vartante | Athavaa sanatkumaara shaapaat unmatta   
vrata dhruk |*** There is an instance of *Sanatkumaara shaapa* for *Durvaasa*, because of which he was as though inebriated. It is also said that yogis behave like this. *Yogis* when they are in *aatma anubhava*, behave like inert  [[297]] objects, *jada*, without realizing anything that is happening around. Or as though they are in an inebriated condition. 





*

When he placed it on *Airaavata's * head, it was shining forth like *Ganga * river on *Kailaasa shikhara*. It was such a wonderful view. 



Next, the elephant throws it down, and *Durvaasa Muni * gets very angry, and curses *Indra*. After this, Indra loses all his wealth, and this is told as *tirodhaana * of *Shridevi*. The whole world loses all its prosperity. After that, they do *Amrutha mathana*, the churning of the ocean. ***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 9, where we were starting to study the part where *Durvaasa Muni*, when roaming around as a *yogi*, sees a *Vidyaadhara stree * carrying a wonderful garland, with most wonderful fragrance filling the entire area. He is so much attracted to it, and he begs her to give that garland, and she gives it to him with great respect. He carries it on his head, and is captivated by its fragrance.

You don't give respect to elders. This wonderful garland that I had given you, you are not treating with respect. You are not showing any delight in keeping it. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Aishwarya iti | Stabdhah avinayoddhatah | Atra hetuh shriyeti | Shriyo

It can also be told that the garland bestows all kinds of prosperity.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 13:*** ***Prasaada iti noktam te pranipaatah purah saram |*** ***Harshotpulla kapolena na chaapi shirasaa dhrutaa ||*** Having received the garland by me, you should have accepted it with great respect saying that 'I treat it as your *prasaada*, I am highly blessed', having paid obeisance to me. Feeling extremely happy, and expressing it, you should have worn it on your head. This was not done by you. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Prasaada iti | Te tvayaa |*** *Te * is to be taken as *tvayaa*, by you.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Maddattaa iti | Pranashta lakshmeekam tirohita lakshmeekam | Atra   
pranashta shabdasya tirohitatvam arthah |*** The meaning for *pranashta * should be taken as that it will disappear from you.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Naaham iti | Anye te munayah, ye kshamaavantah |***  [[304]] Those sages who have a lot of tolerance are different, I am not one among them.

bhaavah |*** This instance of *Gautama, Ahalya * and *Indra * comes in *Ramaayana * and other places. *Indra * had a wrong relationship with *Ahalya*, and *Gautama * cursed him. In *Raamayana*, the curse is to be come infertile. In other *puraanaas*, the curse is for his body be covered by the female organ. *Indra * begs *Gautama*, and *Gautama * gets pleased, and changed the curse to have *Indras * entire body to have eyes instead, so he is called *Sahasraaksha*. So, *Gautama * got pleased when *Indra * begged him to forgive him. *Durvaasa * says that he is not a kind person.

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 26:*** ***Tatah prabhruti nisshreekam sa shakram bhuvana trayam |*** ***Maitreya aaseet apadhvastam samksheenoushadhi veerudham ||*** From that time onward, all three worlds were without any wealth and prosperity.

Sattvat bhootyoh itaretara hetutvam | Gunaah satya shoucha

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 30:*** ***Bala shouryaadi abhaavah cha purushaanaam gunaih vinaa |*** ***Langhaneeyah samastasya bala shourya vivarjitah ||*** *Bala, shourya * were absent without the *gunaas * of *satya, shoucha * and *sheela*.

Thus, with extreme absence of prosperity and good qualities, there was no *sattva * at all in the three worlds. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Bhavati iti | Prathitah prasiddhah pumaan, langhitah avajnyaatah

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 33:*** ***Lobhaabhibhootaa nisshreekaa daityaah sattva vivarjitaah |*** ***Shriyaa viheenaih nissatvaih devaih chakruh tato ranam ||*** *Daityaas * by nature are without *sattva guna*, and do not have good qualities, their mind is always covered by *lobha * and such qualities. They, who were naturally without *sattva guna*, waged war against the *devaas* who had lost their good qualities and wealth. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 34:*** ***Vijitaa tridashaa daityaih indraadyaah sharanam yayuh |*** ***Pitaamaham mahaabhaagam hutaashana purogamaah ||***  [[309]] *Indra * and other *devataas * who were won over by the *daityaas*, making *Agni * as the leader, the front, went and took refuge in *Pitaamaha*, *Chaturmukha Brahma. * 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Vijitaa iti | Nisshreekatvaadi dosha saamye api gunavat prakruti   
prachyutaa devaa nirgunatva prakruti sthitaih daityaih nirjitaah |*** Both *devaas * and *asuraas * were *nisshreekaa. Devaas*, by nature were having good qualities and having lost them now, were won over by the *daityaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 35:*** ***Yathaavat kathito devaih brahmaa praaha tatah suraan |*** ***Paraavaresham sharanam vrajadhvam asuraardanam ||*** When *Chaturmukha Brahma * was narrated all the story, he told the *Devaas * thus - the tormentor of the demons, who is none other than *Mahaa Vishnu*, who is the ruler of the entirety of sentients and non sentients, go and surrender unto Him. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 36:*** ***Utpatti sthiti naashanaam ahetum hetum eeshvaram |*** ***Prajaapati patim vishnum anantam aparaajitam ||*** The supreme Lord of everything, *Mahaa Vishnu*, does not have any cause; He is the cause of everything - *utpatti, sthiti, naasha*, creation sustenance destruction. *Vishnu * who is the Lord of even *Prajaapati*, who is endless, undefeatable. 



 [[310]] He has *desha kaala vastu pariccheda raahitya*. He is all pervading, in all objects at all times. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Utpatti iti | Ahetum svayam hetu rahitam \* Na cha asya kaschit janitaa   
\* ityaadi shruteh | Hetum sarvasya utpattyaadeh |*** He is without a cause, He is eternal, cause of everything. There is no creator for Him. He is the cause of creation of everything. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 37:*** ***Pradhaana pumsoh ajayoh kaaranam kaarya bhootayoh |*** ***Pranataartiharam vishnum sa vah shreyo vidhaasyati ||*** He is the cause of *pradhaana \(avyakta, achetana, moola prakruti*, primordial matter\) and *chetana *\(collectivity of all sentients\), the two unborns \(unmanifest and the sentients\), which are the effects. He is none other than Vishnu, who destroys the grief of all those who surrender unto Him. He will do all good to you. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Pradhaana iti | Ajayoh api kaaryatvam vikaaryatvaat svaroopa   
svabhaava anyathaa bhaavena cha |*** Though they are told as unborn and effects; if it is an effect, how can it be said to be unborn? Because it undergoes modifications, *kaarya * is *avasthaantaraapatti*, the cause takes a different state. 



*Pradhaana * continuously undergoes changes into *mahat, ahamkaara, pancha **bhootaas, pancha tanmaatraas; achetana * undergoes change in *svaroopa*, its  [[311]] essential nature itself. Sentients undergo change in their attributive knowledge; their *svaroopa * does not change, but *svabhaava * undergoes change; *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes change because of karma. Both are eternal. In the unmanifest state, primordial matter is eternal. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 38:*** ***Sri Paraasharah - *** ***Evam uktvaa suraan sarvaan brahmaa loka pitaamahah |*** ***Ksheerodasyottaram teeram taireva sahito yayou ||*** *Sri Paraashara - Chaturmukha Brahma * having told all the gods thus, he went to the northern shore of the Milky Ocean, along with all the gods. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Evam iti | Uttaram teeram uttaram koolam shaaka dveepaashritam |*** There is an island called *Shaaka Dveepa*.

Next comes the *Brahma Stuti* of *Paramaatman*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 40:***  [[312]] ***Brahmovaacha -*** ***Namaami sarvam sarvesham anantam ajam avyayam |*** ***Loka dhaama dharaadhaaram aprakaasham abhedinam ||*** Brahma said - I pay obeisance to You, who is everything, who is the Lord of everything, who is all pervading, unborn, who does not undergo any change any time, immutable, residing place for everything in all the worlds, support of the earth, who is not revealed, who does not differentiate. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Namaami iti | Avyayam apakshaya aadi vikaara rahitam | Abhedinam   
bheda anarham |*** There is no *vikaara * for *Paramaatman*, He is immutable. He does not differentiate; those who take refuge in Him, He does not see whether it is an animal, or bird or demon or sage, whether he has good or bad qualities. He protects anyone who takes refuge in Him. As we see in *Kaakaasura, **Sugreeva, Vibheeshana*. 



Every entity in this universe undergoes six types of modification - *asti, **jaayate, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*. These are called *shat bhaava vikaaraas*. He is not subject to any of these, and is said to be *avyaya*. 



*Aprakaasham * means that it is not possible to see Him with all the *praakruta **chakshus. Na sandrushe tishthati roopam asya, na chakshushaa pashyati **kaschanainam. * With His *anugraha * only, His grace only, He can be seen by His devotees. If anyone can see Him, it is through His grace. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 41:***  [[313]] ***Naaraayanam aneeyaamsam asheshaanaam aneeyasaam |*** ***Samastaanaam garishtham cha bhooraadeenaam gareeyasaam ||*** *Naaraayana * is more subtle than all subtle things. He is bigger than even the *lokaas*, the *Bhoo * and other *lokaas*. 



*Naaraayana * is a unique name of *Paramaatman*, and it has got two meanings, *Naaraanaam ayanam, Naaraah ayanam yasya sah, Tatpurusha **samaasa * or *Bahuvreehi samaasa*; He resides in everything as *antaryaami*, and He is the goal or refuge of everything. He is bigger than the big and smaller than the small. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Naaraayanam iti | Aneeyasaam aatmanaam |*** The most subtle entity is the self itself, the *aatmaas*, and He is more subtle than even the *aatmaas*. 



He is the inner controller of the *aatman * itself. He does *anupravesha * of the *aatman * also. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 42:*** ***Yatra sarvam yatah sarvam utpannam matpurassaram |*** ***Sarva bhootascha yo devah paraanaam api yah parah ||*** Starting with me, everything was created, everything resides in Him. All beings are He only. Everything is His body, His *prakaara * being His *shareera*. Everything is controlled by Him, supported by Him and ruled by Him. He is supreme even than the exalted ones. 



 [[314]] The *vyutpatti * of the word *Vaasudeva * is *sarvatra asou samastam cha vasati **atreti vai yatah, tatah sa vaasudeveti vidvadbhih paripathyate*. Everything resides in Him, and He resides in everything. Everything is supported by Him, being His *shareera*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 43:*** ***Parah parasmaat purushaat paramaatma svaroopa dhruk |*** ***Yogibhih chintyate yo asou mukti hetoh mumukshubhih ||*** He is superior than even the *muktaas*, the liberated ones. He is Supreme in His essential nature. He is meditated by the *yogis*. By *mumukshus * who are desirous of liberation, He is meditated upon as the bestower of liberation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Para iti | Parasmaat muktaat |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 44:*** ***Sattvaadayo na santeeshe yatra cha praakrutaa gunaah |*** ***Sa shuddhah sarva shuddhebhyah pumaan aadyah praseedatu ||*** He is the ruler of everything, Supreme ruler. In Him, the material qualities, *sattva, rajas * and *tamas * are not present. He is *apraakruta, divya*. He is more pure than all the pure things. One who is the cause of everything, let Him get pleased and grace us. 



*Sattva, rajas, tamas * are present in all things material, *prakruti, mahat, **ahamkaara, pancha bhootaas, pancha tanmaatraas, indriyaas, deha*. They are all various effects, states of *prakruti*. Whereas *Paramaatman * is *shuddha **sattva, apraakruta*.  [[315]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Sattvaadaya iti | Atah sarva bhootebhyah shuddhah |*** He is purer than everything else. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 45:*** ***Kalaa kaashthaa muhoorta aadi kalaa sootrasya gochare |*** ***Yasya shaktih na shuddhasya praseedatu sa no harih ||*** His glories are not controlled by *kalaa, kaashthaa, muhoorta*, and the other time divisions. He is not controlled by time; He controls time also. One who is the purest, that *Hari*, let Him be pleased with us. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kalaa iti | Shaktih lakshmeeh | Vigraha parijana paricchada aadi   
vibhootih | \* Kalaa muhoortaadi mayah cha kaalo na yat vibhooteh   
parinaama hetuh \* ityaadeh |*** All His wealth such as *vigraha, parijana, paricchada*, His divine auspicious form, the *nityaas * and *muktaas * who are serving Him all the time - all these put together are called as His *shakti, vibhooti*. 



In this *prakruti mandala*, everything is controlled and limited by time. Beyond a time, things do not exist. Even *Chaturmukha Brahma * has a limited life period of hundred years of his; after that, he gets merged and *pralaya * happens. Whereas in *Parama pada*, time is controlled by *Paramaatman*, and nothing is controlled by time there. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 46:***  [[316]] ***Prochyate paramesho ajo yah shuddho api upachaaratah |*** ***Praseedatu sa no vishnuh aatmaa yat sarva dehinaam ||*** He is the inner controller of all embodied beings. Let Him be pleased with us, let Him grace us. A *mukta * is told as *shuddha * in the secondary sense. *Paramaatman * is the inner self of *muktaas * also. That *Vishnu * who is controller of all these - *muktaas * and *baddhaas*, let Him grace us. 



*Dehi * means one who has the *deha*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Prochyata iti | Upachaaratah | Shuddhah muktah, poorvam   
avidyaantargatatvena shuddhayabhaavaat yah shuddho api   
upachaaratah iti anvayah | Atra hetuh aatmaa yah sarva dehinaam iti   
|*** One who had *karma * earlier, and was impure; after getting rid of the *karma*, when he becomes a liberated self, becomes *shuddha*. A *mukta * even though told as *shuddha*, he is not *shuddha * all the time; at one time, he was *baddha*, a bound self, and then became *mukta*. Embodied selves are *ashuddha * because they are under the sway of karma. 



*Brahma's stuti*, the most wonderful prayer of *Chaturmukha **Brahma * continues. ***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 9, *Brahma Stuti*, where *Chaturmukha Brahma * along with all the *devaas * goes and prays to *Bhagavaan*, standing on the shore of *Ksheera Saagara*. They all surrender unto *Bhagavaan*. They have lost all their wealth. *Chaturmukha **Brahma * tells to the *devaas * to go and pray to *Bhagavaan*, and that He is the one who can actually help us in this trouble. 



 [[317]] *Brahma * starts to pray, extolling *Bhagavaan's * wonderful *svaroopa*, that *Bhagavaan * is *sarvaantaryaami, sarva gata*, everything is Him only, everything is His *prakaara * being His *shareera*. He said that 'You are superior to even the *muktaas*, the liberated ones; You are meditated upon by *yogis*, and are the cause of liberation, those who are desirous of liberation meditate upon You'. He is purer than everything that is pure; He is the *aadya*, the first, there is no one before Him. He does not have the *praakruta gunaas*, the material qualities of *sattva, **rajas * and *tamas * of *prakruti*, because He has an *apraakruta divya mangala **vigraha*. The various divisions of time are all controlled by *Paramaatman*. There is *kaala * in *Parama Pada* also, but *kaala * has no control there. Whereas in the *prakruti mandala*, everything is controlled by time. 



The word *shuddha * is used in many *shlokaas * here, and has different meanings. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 46:*** ***Prochyate paramesho ajo yah shuddho api upachaaratah |*** ***Praseedatu sa no vishnuh aatmaa yat sarva dehinaam ||*** *Bhagavaan * is said to be *upachaaratah shuddha*. One who is the inner controller of all embodied souls, *Vishnu*, let Him be pleased. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Prochyata iti | Upachaaratah | Shuddhah muktah, poorvam   
avidyaantargatatvena shuddhayabhaavaat yah shuddho api   
upachaaratah iti anvayah | Atra hetuh aatmaa yah sarva dehinaam iti   
|*** One who had *karma * earlier, and was impure; after getting rid of the *karma*, when he becomes a liberated self, becomes *shuddha*. A *mukta * even though told as *shuddha*, he is not *shuddha * all the time; at one time, he  [[318]] was *baddha*, a bound self, and then became *mukta*. Embodied selves are *ashuddha * because they are under the sway of *karma*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 47: *** ***Yah kaaranam cha kaaryam cha kaaranasya api kaaranam |*** ***Kaaryasya api cha yah kaaryam praseedatu sa no harih ||*** *Chaturmukha Brahma * eulogizes *Bhagavaan * that He is *kaarana avasthaa, **kaarya avasthaa*, everything is *Bhagavaan * only. The *kaarana * is different from *Bhagavaan*, who is also the cause of everything. *Prakruti * is also He only, and *mahat tattva * is also He only. He is *antaryaami * of everything, and that is all His *shareera*. He is *prakruti shareeraka brahma, mahat **shareeraka Paramaatman*. He is also the effect of the effect. Let that *Hari * be pleased with us. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yah iti | Kaaranam iti | Kaaranam prakrutih mahatah kaaranatvaat,   
kaaryam mahaan | Kaaranasya prakruteh api kaaranam brahma |   
Kaaryasya mahatah kaaryam ahamkaarah |*** Here, the meaning of *kaaranam * is *prakruti*, according to Commentary, because it is the cause of *mahat. Kaaryam * is *mahaan * or *mahat * itself, the effect of *moola prakruti*. He is the cause of even *moola prakruti*. He is *ahamkaara * which is the effect of *mahat*, which is the effect of *moola **prakruti*. 



*Moola prakruti * is eternal, how can He be said to be the *kaaranam*? He is the cause of sustenance, though it is eternal. It is due to *Paramaatman's **sankalpa * that it is eternal. He is only controlling it and supporting it. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 48:***  [[319]] ***Kaarya kaaryasya yat kaaryam tat kaaryasya api yat svayam |*** ***Tat kaarya kaarya bhooto yah tatah cha pranataasma tam ||*** *Mahat, ahamkaara tattva*, and *pancha tanmaatraas*, and its effect the *bhoota panchaka*, He Himself is all these. The *kaarya * of *bhoota **panchaka*, which is *Viraat*, the *Anda*, then *Chaturmukha Brahma*, then the *jagat*, the world, all these are You only. 



This *shloka * has the usage of word *kaarya * many times. 



*Pranataah * means *prakarshena nataah*, we are bowing with great reverence. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kaarya kaaryasya iti | Kaarya kaaryasya kaarya bhoota mahat   
kaaryasya ahamkaarasya kaaryam tanmaatra panchakam tasya api   
kaaryam bhoota panchakam, tat kaaryasya andasya kaaryam   
chaturmukhah, tatah cha kaaryam iti anushangah, tat kaaryam jagat,   
tat sarvam yah svayam eva tam pranataassma iyi anvayah |*** *Kaarya kaaryasya * means *ahamkaarasya*. First *kaarya * stands for *mahat*, and second *kaarya * stands for *ahamkaara. Ahamkaara tattva * modifies into *pancha tanmaatraas*. The effect of *tanmaatra panchaka * is *bhoota **panchaka*. Then the *Anda*, then *Chaturmukha Brahma*, then the world. He Himself is all of these means that He has all of these as His *shareera * and He is present as *antaryaami * of these, controlling everything. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 49:*** ***Kaaranam kaaranasyaapi tasya kaarana kaaranam |*** ***Tat kaaranaanaam hetum tam pranataassma sureshvaram ||***  [[320]] For *Chaturmukha Brahma*, the *anda * is the *kaarana*, then *bhoota panchaka*, and *tanmaatra panchaka*. The cause of these - *ahamkaara, mahat, moola **prakruti*, that Supreme Lord, we pay obeisance to. 



This *shloka * has the usage of word *kaarana * many times. Here it is told in the reverse order as the previous *shloka*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kaaranam iti | Kaaranasya jagat kaaranasya chaturmukhasya,   
kaaranam andam, tasya kaaranam bhoota panchakam, tat kaaranam   
tanmaatra panchakam, tat kaaranaanaam ahamkaara mahat   
prakruteenaam hetum kaaranam | Kaarana avastham kaarya avastham   
cha sarvam tvam eva iti arthah |*** For *Chaturmukha Brahma, anda * is the cause; for *anda*, the cause is *bhoota **panchaka*, then *tanmaatra panchaka*. The cause of these, in reverse order, is *ahamkaara, mahat, moola prakruti*. First, He is told as *kaarana avasthaa*, and also *kaarya avasthaa*. 



The order of creation is *moola prakruti, mahat, ahamkaara*, etc. During *pralaya*, the *laya * order is that effects go and merge into their causes. In each one of these, they happen only because *Paramaatman * is *antaryaami*. It is not that *moola prakruti * itself becomes the cause of *mahat, mahat * becomes cause of *ahamkaara*, etc. *Mahat shareeraka Paramaatman * only becomes cause of *ahamkaara*. First, it is told in the *srushti * order, and then told in the *pralaya * order. In both of these, *Paramaatman * only is the cause in every single step. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 50:*** ***Bhoktaaram bhojya bhootam cha srashtaaram srajyam eva cha |***  [[321]] ***Kaarya kartru svaroopam tam pranataassma param padam ||*** The enjoyer and object of enjoyment, the creator and the created, everything is *Paramaatman * only. All the actions and the doers, the nature of all that is *Paramaatman * only. That which is attained is *Param padam*, that is also *Paramaatma svaroopa * only. Such a *Paramaatman*, we bow in reverence. 



It should be taken as *bhogya bhootam*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Bhoktaaram iti | Bhojyam bhogyam shabdaadi srujyam ghataadi   
kaaryam yaagaadi gatyaadi cha | Param padam paramam praapya   
sthaanam |*** *Bhogya * are the objects of senses - *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, gandha. **Bhoktru * is the enjoyer. *Srashtaa * is the creator. *Srujya * is the *ghata, pata*, the objects which are created. *Kaaryam * is the actions like *yaaga, gati*, all kinds of movements, etc., everything is *Paramaatman*. The doers of all those are also *Paramaatman * only. *Param padam * has three meanings -*jeevaatma svaroopa*, the *Vaikuntha *\(the *sthaana* where *Paramaatman * resides\), *Paramaatma **svaroopa * itself. Here it means *Bhagavaan * only. 





After having eulogized *Bhagavaan * that He is what is seen in various states of effects or causes, if He is only present as cause and effect in various states, does He undergo any modifications, are there any defects in Him? These doubts are removed here. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 51:*** ***Vishuddha bodhavat nityam ajam akshayam avyayam |*** ***Avyaktam avikaaram yat tat vishnoh paramam padam ||***  [[322]] He is *parishuddha jnyaana svaroopa*, He is eternal, He is unborn, He is undeteriorating, He is immutable, does not change, He is unmanifest, not easy to see or know, He does not undergo any change, that Supreme nature of *Paramaatman*, we pay our obeisance. 



Though there are changes in His *shareera*, the *prakruti * undergoes change in its *svaroopa * itself, the *jeevaatmans * undergo change in their *dharma bhoota **jnyaana, Paramaatman * who is *shareeri, antaryaami*, does not undergo any change at any point of time. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 52:*** ***Na sthoolam na cha sookshmam yat na visheshana gocharam |*** ***Tat padam paramam vishnoh pranamaama sadaa amalam ||*** He is not the gross, He is not the subtle, He cannot be identified or denoted by any other attribute. He is everything. We cannot say that He is just *sthoola*; because He is also *sookshma*. If He is said to be *sookshma*, He is also *sthoola*. He is not mere that, He is that and everything else also. He is untainted by any defects of *prakruti * or *jeevaatmans*, even though He is existing as the *antaryaami * of everything. We pay obeisance to Him. 



*Asthoolam, ananu, ahrasvam, akaayam, avranam, Shruti * says so. He is not this, He is not that, etc. means that He is this also, He is that also, He is everything else also. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 53:*** ***Yasya ayuta ayuta amsha amshe vishva shaktih iyam sthitaa |*** ***Para brahma svaroopasya pranamaamah tam avyayam ||***  [[323]] This whole world, which is His *shareera*, which is also said to be His *shakti*, that *vishva shakti*, the *Parabrahma svaroopa*, a part of the ten thousandth part of the ten thousandth part of His *svaroopa*, that immutable *Paramaatman*, we pay obeisance to. 



*Shakti * is also one synonym for *shareera*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yasya iti | Ayutaamsho yah, tasya aayutaamsho yah, tasya amshe   
sthitaa merorivaanuh; paado asyetaadih vishva shaktih jaganmaayee |*** Take a ten thousandth part, and again divide into ten thousandth, a part of that, in that, the entire world is supported and is existing. One cannot even imagine His *svaroopa*. This whole world, the *prakruti mandala * is itself so huge, the whole thing is just a speck in His *svaroopa*. It is like an atom in front of *Meru parvata*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 54:*** ***Yat yoginah sadaa udyuktaah punya paapa kshaye akshayam |*** ***Pashyanti pranave chintyam tat vishnoh paramam padam ||*** *Yogis * who are always engaged in meditating upon *Paramaatman*, who get the *saakshaatkaara * of *Paramaatman * through *Pranava*, who is meditated upon as the meaning of the *Pranava*, that *Vishnu's Parama Pada*, we bow to. When both the *bandhakaas punya * and *paapa * are got rid of, yogis get a direct vision of the Lord, who is to be meditated upon through *Pranava*. Such a wonderful *svaroopa * of *Paramaatman*, we bow unto. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yat iti | Akshayam iti paricchedah |***  [[324]] 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 55:*** ***Yat na devaa na munayo na cha aham na cha shankarah |*** ***Jaananti parameshasya tat vishnoh paramam padam ||*** What else to say? That nature of *Paramaatman*, nobody can know, gods, sages, *Shankara*, and I also, cannot know, that wonderful *svaroopa * of *Vishnu*, we bow unto. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 56:*** ***Shaktayo yasya devasya brahma vishnu shivaatmikaah |*** ***Bhavanti abhoota poorvasya tat vishnoh paramam padam ||*** *Abhoota purvasya* тАУ one before whom there was none, *yasya devasya* тАУ that *ParamatmanтАЩs* тАУ *brahmaa Vishnu shivaatmikaah shaktayah bhavanti тАУ **Chaturmukha Brahma, Vishnu* and *Shiva* are the *shareeras* \( *Vishnu* is also said as *shakti* but *Vishnu* is actual manifestation of *Paramatman* is to be understood\), that *vishnoh paramam padam* тАУ that *VishnuтАЩs* supreme form we prostrate unto. 





***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Abhoota poorvasya na bhootam poorvam yasmaat tasya, sa hi   
sarvasmaat poorvah | Bhoota poorvasya iti paathe bhootaanaam   
poorva iti |*** *Bhoota poorvasya* is also a *pathaantara* тАУ in that case it means HE existed before all beings. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 57:***  [[325]] ***Sarvesha sarva bhootaatman sarva sarvaashraya achyuta |*** ***Praseeda vishno bhaktaanaam vraja no drushti gocharam ||*** Lord of everything, the inner self of everything, everything is present as His form only, He is refuge to everything, everything is supported in Him, he does not have *chyuti * anytime, He is immutable. Please do grace us, we are all praying unto You, and do appear in front of us.

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 59:*** ***Yat na ayam bhagavaan brahmaa jaanaati paramam padam |*** ***Tat nataah sma jagat dhaama tava sarva gata achyuta ||*** If *Chaturmukha Brahma * also cannot know, then nobody else can know. That support of the entire world, Your wonderful nature, You are all pervading, O *Achyuta*, we prostrated unto You.

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 78:*** ***Mathyataam amrutam devaah sahaaye mayi avasthite ||*** I am going to be present and helping you; churn the ocean in order to get *amruta*. 



 [[333]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Mathyataam iti | Amrutam mathyataam mathanena amrutam

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 79:*** ***Saama poorvam cha daiteyaah tatra saamaanya karmani |*** ***Saamaanya phala bhoktaaro yooyam vaachyaa bhavishyatha ||*** *Bhagavaan * tells the gods what to tell the *daityaas *- Tell them in good words, that this is a common activity for both, and that both will get the fruits that will come. Please come and take part in this common activity. 



The four ways of treatment are *saama, daana, bheda, danda. * 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 80:*** ***Mathyamaane cha tatra abdhou yat samutpatsyate amrutam |*** ***Tat paanaat balino yooyam amaraah cha bhavishyatha ||*** Tell the *daityaas * that when we are going to churn this Milk Ocean, the *amruta * which is going to be generated, you will become very powerful and also immortal. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 81:*** ***Tathaa cha aham karishyaami te yathaa tridashadvishah |*** ***Na praapsyanti amrutam devaah kevalam kleshabhaaginah ||***  [[334]] I will do in such a way that those *asuraas * who are the enemies of gods they will not get *amruta*, they will only undergo sufferings and misery. 



When all the gods went and surrendered unto Him along with *Chaturmukha **Brahma, Bhagavaan * tells them to bring the *daityaas * also, and make them also part of this common activity, and tell them to partake the *amruta * which is going to be generated from this churning, and I will see to it that they will not partake this *amruta * but will only be subjected to all kinds of suffering and misery, and you will get all the benefits and get back all your wealth, powers and prosperity. 



Now, the *ksheera saagara mathana * will start. Sage *Paraasharar * will start to tell that. ***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Amsha * 1, Chapter 9, where *Chaturmukha Brahma, devaas * and *rishis * eulogize *Paramaatman*, and pray to Him to appear before them, He promptly appears revealing His wonderful auspicious form, they surrender unto Him, and say that they have lost all their glory, and pray to restore their glory. *Bhagavaan * tells them to "Do as I tell you, churn the *Ksheera Abdhi*, the Ocean of Milk, making *Mandara Parvata * itself as the staff, and the great serpent *Vaasuki * as the cord, include the *daanavaas*, and tell them that they will also get an equal portion of the *amruta * which is going to be generated from the churning. I will help you and see to it that they do not get the nectar of immortality, and you will get everything". *Paraasharar * says what happened after that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 82:*** ***Sri Paraasharah - *** ***Ityuktaa devadevena sarva eva tatah suraah |*** ***Sandhaanam asuraih krutvaa yatnavanto amrute abhavan ||***  [[335]] *Sri Paraasharar * said - Being told thus by the Supreme Lord, all the *devaas * made an agreement with the *asuraas * that they will get equal proportion of the *amruta * that they will get from this churning, and started to engage in churning of the ocean. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 83:*** ***Naanaa oushadheeh samaaneeya deva daiteya daanavaah |*** ***Kshiptvaa ksheeraabdhi payasi sharadabhra amalatvishi ||*** They brought various herbs, all the *devaas * and *daanavaas*, and threw them in the *Ksheera Abdhi*, it was as though the clouds of the *sharad kaala*, it was so pure and glowing. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 84:*** ***Manthanam mandaram krutvaa yoktram krutvaa cha vaasukim |*** ***Tato mathitum aarabdhaah maitreya tarasaa amrutam ||*** They made the *Manthara parvata * itself as the staff for churning, the great serpent *Vaasuki * was made as the rope for churning, and they started to churn the ocean with great speed in order to generate *amruta*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 85:*** ***Vibudhah sahitaah sarve yatah puccham tatah krutaah |*** ***Krishnena vaasukeh daityaah poorva kaaye niveshitaah ||*** The Lord *Sarveshvara * is told as *Krishna * here. *Krishna * made all the *asuraas * stand towards the head portion of *Vaasuki*, and all the *devaas * were made to hold the tail portion of *Vaasuki*. 



 [[336]] In *Bhagavata * it is said that when *Krishna * told the *daanavaas * to hold the tail, they thought it was below their prestige to hold the tail; they said that they will hold the head part of *Vaasuki*. But here it is not told so. *Bhagavaan * saw to it that the *daanavaas * were located towards the head portion of *Vaasuki * serpent. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 86: *** ***Te tasya mukha nihsvaasa vanhinaa apahatatvishah |*** ***Nistejaso asuraah sarve babhoovuh amitoujasah ||*** All the *asuraas * were extremely exhausted, they lost all their strength and vigour, because of being hit by the breath of *Vaasuki*, the fire which was coming out of the mouth of *Vaasuki*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Ta iti | Amitoujasah tasya iti anvayah |*** *Amitoujasah * is an adjective to *Vaasuki*, the serpent. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 87:*** ***Tenaiva mukha nihsvaasa vaayunaasta balaahakaih |*** ***Puccha pradeshe varshadbhih tathaa cha aapyaayitaah suraah ||*** The *devaas * were located at the tail end of *Vaasuki*; there were lot of clouds blown by the breath of *Vaasuki*, and these clouds moved towards the tail, and started to rain cool waters on the *devataas*; they were never feeling tired. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[337]] ***Tena eva iti | Vanhinaastam balaahakaih iti paathe, pucche vanhinaa

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 140:*** ***Sri Paraasharah -*** ***Evam dadou varou devee devaraajaaya vai puraa |*** ***Maitreya shreeh mahaa bhaagaa stotra aaraadhana toshitaa ||*** *Sri Paraashara *- Thus, *Shridevi * gave Indra two boons, O *Maitreya*, being very pleased by his worship with the *stotraas*. 





Now, *Paraasharar * tells about the nature of Her manifestations. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 141:*** ***Bhrugoh khyaatyaam samutpannaa shreeh poorvam udadheh punah |*** ***Deva daanava yatnena prasootaa amruta manthane ||*** Initially She was born of *Bhrugu * in *Khyaati*, and again She manifested in the *Ksheera Abdhi*, during the churning of the ocean, for *amruta * which was done by *devaas * and *daanavaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 142:*** ***Evam yadaa jagat svamee deva devo janaardanah |*** ***Avataaram karoti eshaa tadaa shreeh tat sahaayinee ||*** Whenever *Devadeva*, who is the Supreme of the Lords, the Master of the all the worlds, *Janaardana*, manifests, *Shri * also manifests along with Him. 



 [[356]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Evam iti | Tat sahaayinee tena saha ayate gacchati iti tat sahaayinee,   
tat sahachaarinee iti arthah |*** One who goes with Him, She is always inseparably associated with Him, She always manifests along with Him, is the meaning. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 143:*** ***Punascha \(padmaat utpannaa\) padmaa sambhootaa hi aadityo abhoot   
yadaa harih |*** ***Yadaa cha bhaargavo raamah tadaa abhoot harinee tu iyam ||*** Again, when He incarnated as *Aaditya*, \(the twelfth son of *Aditi*, the *Vaamana Avataara\), Shri * manifested as *Padmaa*. When He manifested as *Bhaargava Raama, Parashuraama*, She manifested as *Harini*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 144:*** ***Raaghavatve abhavat seetaa rukmanee krishna janmani |*** ***Anyeshu cha avataareshu vishnoh eshaa anapaayinee ||*** When *Bhagavaan * incarnated as *Sriraama*, She became *Seeta*. And, in His incarnation as *Krishna*, She manifested as *Rukmini*. In whatever *avataaraas **Vishnu * is seen, She is always inseparably associated with Him. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 145:*** ***Devatve deva dehaa iyam manushyatve cha maanushee |*** ***Vishnoh deha anuroopaam vai karoti eshaa aatmanah tanum ||*** Whenever He takes the form of a *deva*, She also takes the form of a *devataa*. Whenever He takes the form of a human, She also takes a human  [[357]] form. Whatever form He takes in whichever class, accordingly She also manifests taking on a similar form. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 146:*** ***Yah cha etat shrunuyaat janma lakshmyaa yah cha pathet narah |*** ***Shriyo na vichyutih tasya gruhe yaavat kula trayam ||*** The purpose of *Paraasharar * teaching all these to Maitreya, is that it is going to be extremely beneficial for anyone who recites all these things. To this day, it brings all good to one who recites this. This *avataara * of *Lakshmi*, whoever listens to this, or whoever reads this, *Shridevi * will never desert him, and he will always be having all kinds of glory and prosperity. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 147:*** ***Pathyate yeshu cha eva eshaa gruheshu shree kathaa mune |*** ***Alakshmee kalahaadhaaraa na teshu aaste kadaachana ||*** In whichever house this story of *Shridevi's * manifestations is being read, *Alakshmi * who is the cause of all kinds of quarrel, will never find a place, will never be present in that house. 



This is the greatness of the manifestation of *Shridevi*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 148:*** ***Etat te kathitam sarvam yat maam tvam pariprucchasi |*** ***Ksheeraabdhou shreeh yathaa jaataa poorvam bhrugu sutaa satee ||*** As you requested me to tell, I have recited to you as it is, all of them - being the daughter of *Bhrugu * earlier, how She manifested in the *Ksheera Abdhi*.  [[358]] 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 149:*** ***Iti sakala vibhooti avaapti hetuh stutih iyam indra mukhodgaataa hi   
laskmyaah |*** ***Anudinam iha pathyate nrubhih yaih vasati na teshu kadaachit api   
alakshmeeh ||*** This *Lakshmi Stuti*, which has come from *Indra*, is the cause of one attaining all kinds of glory. Whoever reads this everyday, *Lakshmi * will never desert them. 



This is the *phala * of the recitation. Most of the *puraana kathaas * have a *phala * in the end. This is why these *puraanaas * are recited, and people sit and listen to them. People do *paaraayanam * also. Because it brings in immense glories and all good. 



Thus the Ninth Chapter comes to an end.

From then on, the *Bhrugu vamsha * expanded a lot after that. 



Now, *Paraasharar * starts to tell about the daughter. We read about this in Chapter 7, *shloka * 22, about the children of *Daksha. Daksha * had 24 children from *Prasooti. Khyaati, Sati * and *Sambhooti * married *Bhrugu, Rudra \(Bhava*\)  [[361]] and *Mareechi*. Then the *Bhrugu vamsha * was told. *Sati * married *Rudra*, and *Rudra srushti * was told in Chapter 8. Chapter 8, *shloka * 12 tells that *Rudra * takes *Sati * as his wife. *Sati * dies in the *Daksha yaaga*, which was also told, due to *Daksha kopa*; so that *vamsha * did not continue after that.

If you had been fortunate, you would not have been talked to like this. You do not have to get agitated like this. This is the result of your own deeds only, whatever you have done earlier. If you have done something wrong in your earlier *janma*, the result of that nobody can see. If you have not done something good, you cannot get good because of that. Whatever you have not done, someone cannot give you that. Whatever you have done, someone cannot take it away from you. 



You will reap the benefits according to whatever you have done. If you had done something good, you would have got something good. If you had done something bad, you will face something bad only.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 19:*** ***Raajaasanam tathaa chatram varaashvaa vara vaaranaah |*** ***Yasya punyaani tasya ete matvaa etacchaamya putraka ||*** The throne of the king, the white sovereign umbrella, all the elephants and horses, whoever has done a lot of *punya*, only such a person will get all these things. Understanding this, please give up your anger. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 20:***  [[374]] ***Anya janma krutaih punyaih suruchyaam suruchih nrupah |*** ***Bhaaryaa iti prochyate cha anyaa madvidhaa punya varjitaa ||*** Because *Suruchi * has done *punya * in previous *janma*, king is very dear to her, and always nice to her. Whereas the other one, who is me, who does not have any *punya*, will be simply called as a wife. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 21:*** ***Punya upachaya sampanna tasyaah putrah tathaa uttamah |*** ***Mama putrah tathaa jaatah svalpa punyo dhruvo bhavaan ||*** His son *Uttama * also has done a lot of *punya*. You, who are having very less *punya * are born as my son. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 22:*** ***Tathaa api dukham na bhavaan kartum arhasi putraka |*** ***Yasya yaavat sa tena eva svena tushyati buddhimaan ||*** Even then, you should not feel sad because of this. Whatever one deserves, one will get. Whatever one gets, he should be happy with that only. One who is intelligent will understand that whatever one gains is because of some *punya*, whatever one does not gain is because of some *paapa*. Understand this, and be happy with what you get. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 23:*** ***Yadi te dukham atyartham suruchyaa vachasaa abhavat |*** ***Tat punya upachaye yatnam kuru sarva phala prade ||***  [[375]] By listening to *Suruchi's * words, if you felt extremely sad, try to accumulate more *punya*, which will give you all kinds of benefits. Try to engage yourself in performing good deeds. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 24:*** ***Susheelo bhava dharmaatmaa maitrah praani hite ratah |*** ***Nimnam yathaa aapah pravanaah paatram aayaanti sampadam ||*** Become one with good *aachaara*, good conduct, and follow the path of *dharma*. Be friendly with everyone, be good to all beings. Waters which flow down will only be respected by everyone. 



Engage in these kinds of things, and accumulate *punya*. This is the advice *Suniti * gives to *Dhruva. Dhruva * does not listen to this, and goes and does penance, which is a well known story. 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we just started to study the *Dhruva **upaakhyaana*, the story of *Dhruva*. When *Dhruva * feels extremely sad when he could not sit on the lap of his father, while his stepmother *Suruchi's * son *Uttama * sat on the lap, he gets extremely sad and comes to his mother crying, and *Suniti* gives him some wonderful advice, which is essentially the teachings of all *shaastraas*, the *karma siddhaanta*. She tells him 'O my son, please do not get disturbed; if you did not enjoy something, it is because you did not do the right deeds in your previous births earlier. The result what you get today is the result of your own past deeds. If you had done something good, you will enjoy good things. If you had not done something good, you will not get it. You should not worry about it. *Uttama * had done some good deeds in his previous births, so he gets to enjoy the benefits of the kingdom, whereas you had not done such good deeds, and so you are not getting. Whatever little one gets, an intelligent person should feel happy about it. This is what you deserve, based on the deeds done earlier. If everything is based on past deeds, is there no other way? The answer is that it is not so. *Shaastra * tells that it is possible to correct what you do in future. From now onwards, it is in your hands. Till now, whatever you did knowingly or unknowingly is all gone.  [[376]] From this point onwards, it is in your own hands to do the right things. If you do good deeds from now on, you will get to reap good benefits and enjoy good things in future. So, engage in good deeds from now on.' 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 24:*** ***Susheelo bhava dharmaatmaa maitrah praani hite ratah |*** ***Nimnam yathaa aapah pravanaah paatram aayaanti sampadam ||*** Follow good conduct, *sadaachaara*, and follow the path of *dharma*. Be good to all the beings. If you start doing all these, you will definitely get good benefits in future. You have to be always caring for everyone, always follow the path of *dharma*, and not feel proud of yourself; waters when they flow down and form a pond, everyone wants to start using it, and respect that water. 



So, she gives him wonderful advice. *Dhruva * is a *Kshatriya * child. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 25:*** ***Dhruva uvaacha - *** ***Amba yat tvam idam praattha prashamaaya vacho mama |*** ***Na etat durvachasaa bhinne hrudaye mama tishthati ||*** *Dhruva * said - O mother, in order to dispel my grief, whatever you said; my heart is completely broken, with the bad words that I have heard from *Suruchi*. Your good words have no place in my heart.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 26:*** ***So aham tathaa yatishyaami yathaa sarvottamottamam |*** ***Sthaanam praapsyaami asheshaanaam jagataam abhipoojitam ||*** I am going to definitely try for a place; I am going to attain a most supreme position; whatever has to be done to attain such a supreme position, I am going to engage in that.

I am not born from her womb. I am not her son. Though I was nurtured in your womb, you are now going to see what is it that I can achieve. You will see my capabilities now. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 28:*** ***Uttamah sa mama bhraataa yo garbhena dhrutah tayaa |*** ***Sa raajnyaa aasanam aapnotu pitraa dattam tathaa astu tat ||***  [[377]] My brother *Uttama * who was born of *Suruchi*, let him get the king's throne, which is given by my father to him. Let it be so. I am going to attain the highest position which is respected by the entire world. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 29:*** ***Na anyadattam abheepsyaami sthaanam amba sva karmanaa |*** ***Icchaami tat aham sthaanam yat na praapa pitaa mama ||*** I do not enjoy and accept what is given by others; out of my own efforts, I am going to obtain a place which even my father did not attain.

They had come there knowing what he is going to do, and to grace him with blessings, they were seated on *krishnaajina*, and *uttareeya*, and *vistara* means *darbhaasana*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yathaa iti japaanga prashnah |*** 





*Rishis * now teach him how to worship the Supreme *Brahman*, and what are the *mantraas * to be chanted, to do the *japa*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 52:*** ***Rishayah oochuh - *** ***Raaja putra yathaa vishnoh aaraadhana paraih naraih |*** ***Kaaryam aaraadhanam tat no yathaavat shrotum arhasi ||*** O prince, please do listen what we are going to say. Those who are desiring to worship *Vishnu*, how should they actually worship *Vishnu*, that we are going to say. As it is, we are going to tell you, please do listen to that. 





With the next three *shlokaas*, they teach the process of worshipping the Supreme *Brahman, Vishnu*, and also the mantra which has to be chanted. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 53:*** ***Baahyaarthaat akhilaat chittam tyaajayet prathamam narah |*** ***Tasmin eva jagat dhaamni tatah kurveeta nischalam ||*** First, one has to withdraw the mind from all the external sense objects. Mind should be steady, should not wander around here and there. Focussing the mind on only that ultimate refuge or resort of this whole world, and meditating upon that Supreme Being. 



 [[383]] Here they are going to teach *Ashtaanga Yoga*, is what we can understand from the Commentary. ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Chitta ekaagrataa roopo yogo japasya angam iti sa yogam japyam   
upadishanti baahya iti tribhih | Baahyaarthaat iti | Baahyaarthaat   
chittam tyaajayet iti himsaa anruta aadi nishiddha tyaaga roopo   
yamah, sarva vishaya tyaaga roopah pratyaahaarah cha uktah,   
nischalam kurveeta iti aasana praanaayaamou, tat adheenatvaat chitta   
sthairyasya tasmin eva iti shubha aashraye dhaaranaa |*** By these three *shlokaas, rishis * teach *Dhruva * the *Ashtaanga Yoga*, which is an accessory to the *aaraadhana*. The nature of that *yoga * is that it is required in order to attain concentration of mind. in order to do the *japa*, the accessory required is that one has to develop concentration of mind, and then do the *japa*, chanting of the *mantra*. Along with that *Ashtaanga **yoga*, they teach him the *mantra * which is to be chanted. *Ashtaanga **Yoga * has *yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa, **dhyaana, samaadhi*. First, one has to give up all the external objects, giving up of telling lies, giving up doing *himsaa*, this is called *yama*; mind has to be controlled, one should desist from telling lies, and doing *himsaa; himsaa * by all the *tri karanaas. Pratyaahaara * is withdrawing the mind from all external sense objects. Achieving steadiness of the mind is possible through *aasana * and *praanaayaama*. Mind has to be steadily focussed on something. *Aasana * and *praanaayaama * are extremely essential. Focus the mind on the Supreme *Brahman*. Focus the mind on the *divya mangala **vigraha * of *Bhagavaan*, this is the *shubha aashraya*. 



First, withdrawing the mind from everything external, giving up telling lies \( *anruta*\), giving up *himsaa*, withdrawing the mind from all external sense objects, achieving steadiness of the mind, thinking of the *divya mangala **vigraha * of *Paramaatman \(dhaaranaa\)*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 54:*** ***Evam ekaagra chittena tanmayena dhruta aatmanaa |*** ***Japtavyam yat nibodha etat tannah paarthiva nandana ||*** Having achieved this kind of steady concentrated mind on the *divya mangala **vigraha * of *Paramaatman*, what is the *japa * to be chanted - listen to us, we are going to tell you. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***  [[384]] ***Evam iti | Dhrutaatmanaa iti | Yathaa arham shouchaadishu   
krutanyeneti niyamah, ekaagra chittena iti dhyaanam, tanmayena iti   
samaadhih, iti ashtaanga yogah uktah |*** The word *evam * indicates that as required for this kind of *ashtaanga yoga. **Shoucha * means *shaastreeya shuddhi, snaana * and others. One should put effort to achieve the *shaastreeya shuddhi*, this is called *niyama*. Focussing the mind on only one object, the *divya mangala vigraha * of the Supreme *Brahman. Tanmaya * means getting completely merged in that object of meditation, this is *samaadhi*. 



How can we say that *rishis * have taught *Ashtaanga Yoga * here? This is explained in the Commentary. After a few *shlokaas, Paraasharar * says in *Shloka * 8 of the next chapter that he is said to be a *yogi*. This indicates that *Ashtaanga Yoga * is what is taught by the *rishis*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 55:*** ***Hiranya garbha purusha pradhaana avyakta roopine |*** ***Om namo vaasudevaaya shuddha jnyaana svaroopine ||*** This is the *mantra * told with *pranava, Om Namo Vaasudevaaya*. One whose essential nature is pure *jnyaana*, He is present in all these forms, *Hiranya **Garbha, Purusha, Pradhaana, Avyakta*, means that He is *antaryaami*, everything is His *shareera*, being controlled by Him, being supported by Him. Such a *Paramaatman * who is *Vaasudeva*, I bow down and surrender unto Him. His essential nature is like that. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Hiranya iti | \* Hiranyam asya garbho abhoot hiranyasya api garbhajah

Sa tu rahasya upadeshyatvaat atra yathaa paathe na pathitah |*** The *brahmaanda * is said to be *hiranmaya*, and that *brahmaanda * is in His *garbha*, inside Him, so He is called *Hiranyagarbha*, His womb became *Hiranya*; that *brahmaanda * was born of Him, associated inseparably with Him, He willed. *Viraat * is *brahmaanda, brahmaanda * was created by *Paramaatman*, and then *Chaturmukha Brahma * was created. In *Mahaabhaarata*, the *nirukti * of the word *Hiranyagarbha * is told. He is one in whose womb the *Hiranmaya Brahmaanda * existed. It existed in a state  [[385]] where there was no name and form differentiation, and then He did *naama **roopa vyaakarana * and created all these beings, this is told in the *srushti **prakarana*. Here, *Hiranyagarbha * is told along with the word *Purusha*, the meaning is to be taken as *Paramaatman * who is existing as the *antaraatman * of *kaala; kaala * is also an *upaadaana kaarana * for *srushti*, it is also a *padaartha * in our *siddhaanta*, everything is controlled by *kaala * in this *prakruti mandala*. He is one to whom *kaala * is also a *shareera. * Some people say that *Hiranyagarbha * is *vyashti * and *Purusha * is *samashti. **Samashti * is before the name and form differentiation, *naama roopa **vyaakarana*, before *Chaturmukha Brahma * is created; up to that point, *Paramaatman * directly does the creation, where *prakruti, mahat, **ahamkaara, pancha bhoota tattvaas * are all created. After creating *pancha **bhootaas, Paramaatman * does *pancheekarana*, and then the name and form differentiation happens, from that time, it is called *vyashti srushti*. Before *vyashti srushti, Paramaatman * was Himself existing in those forms, means that He was *antaryaami, mahat shareeraka Paramaatman, **ahamkaara shareeraka Paramaatman*, etc. Here, the *Dvaadashaakshara **Mantra, Om Namo Vaasudevaaya * is meant, but only eight letters are here, *Pranava, Namaha * and *Vaasudevaaya*, because, in *Lainga Puraana*, it is well known that *Dvaadashaakshara * is what *saptarishis * taught *Dhruva*. Because it has to be taught in secrecy, one on one from *Aachaarya * to the *shishya*, in privacy, this is why it is not told here. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 56:*** ***Etat jajaapa bhagavaan japyam svaayambhuvo manuh |*** ***Pitaamahah tava puraa tasya tushto janaardanah ||*** They also justify why this *mantra * can yield such great results. They give an example. They tell *Dhruva * that his grandfather, *Svaayambhuva Manu*, also did *japa * with this *mantra*, and *Janaardana * was extremely pleased with him. 





This is continuation of the previous *shloka*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 57:*** ***Dadou yathaa abhilaashitaam siddhim trailokya durlabhaam |*** ***Tathaa tvam api govindam toshaya etat sadaa japan ||*** That which cannot be easily obtained in all the three worlds, that *Janaardana * gave to *Svaayambhuva Manu*, who did *japa * with this mantra; *Svaayambhuva Manu * being your grandfather, you also do the same thing. Chanting this *mantra * continuously, all the time, you also try to please *Govinda*. With His grace, you will also attain whatever you desire. 



 [[386]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Dadou iti | Tathaa tvam iti | Kula devataa mantro hi sheeghram   
siddhyati |*** Because his grandfather had done this *japa * of *Janaardana*, He is *kula **devataa * for you, you should also do it, and you will very soon attain whatever you are seeking. 



This completes the Eleventh Chapter. *Saptarishis * have taught him the way in which he has to worship *Govinda*, the *mantra * which he has to chant, and how that can yield the desired fruits, because his own grandfather attained whatever he desired by chanting this *mantra * and worshipping *Govinda, **Janaardana * was extremely pleased with him and granted him all that he desired; you also chant this *mantra * and worship *Govinda*, He will be very pleased and He is the only one who can give you what you are desiring.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 1:*** ***Sri Paraasharah -*** ***Nishamya etat asheshena maitreya nrupateh sutah |*** ***Nirjagaama vanaat tasmaat pranipatya sa taan risheen ||*** O *Maitreya*, that prince *Dhruva*, listened to all these things completely, and after that bowed down in reverence, did *namaskaara * to the *rishis*, and left that forest. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 2:*** ***Krutakrutyam iva aatmaanaam manyamaanah tato dvijah |*** ***Madhu samjnyam mahaa punyam jagaama yamunaa tatam ||*** He felt very happy and as though one who has done what ought to be done, now that he knows what to do to attain what he desires. On the banks of *Yamuna * river, there was a very sacred place called *Madhu*; he went and reached that place. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 3:*** ***Punah cha madhu samjnyena daityena adhishtitam yatah |*** ***Tato madhuvanam naamnaa khyaatam atra maheetale ||***  [[387]] Earlier, that place was occupied by an *asura * by name *Madhu*. So, it was called *Madhuvana * after him; this is well known in this world. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 4:*** ***Hatvaa cha lavanam raksho madhu putram mahaa balam |*** ***Shatrughno madhuraama naama pureem yatra chakaara vai ||*** *Madhu * had a son by name *Lavana * who was very powerful. *Shatrughna*, brother of *Sri Rama*, killed him, and built a city there called *Mathura*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 5:*** ***Yatra vai deva devasya saanidhyam hari medhasah |*** ***Sarva paapa hare tasmin tapah teerthe chakaara sah ||*** In that *saanidhya * of *Deva deva*, Lord of the lords, *Hari * is always present. In that holy place, he did penance, that place itself can destroy all our sins. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yatra iti | Hari medhasah harih paapa haarinee svarnavat shuddhaa   
medhaa yasya sah harimedhaah, tasya harimedhasah |   
Chaandasattvaadasich pratyayah |*** *Harih harati paapaani; Hari * destroys all our sins. That *Hari * is always there all the time. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 6:*** ***Mareechi mukhyaih munibhih yathaa uddishtam abhoot tathaa |*** ***Aatmani ashesha devesham sthitam vishnum amanyata ||*** Just as what was taught by *Mareechi * and other *sapta rishis*, whatever was their object of attainment, the same thing happened there. He started to meditate upon Vishnu in himself, completely occupying his mind. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Mareechi mishraih iti | Amanyata dadyou |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 7:*** ***Ananya chetasah tasya dhyaayato bhagavaan harih |*** ***Sarva bhoota gato vishnuh sarva bhaava gato abhavat ||*** He did not move his mind even little bit, he was completely, steadily, continuously, concentratedly, meditating upon *Hari, Vishnu * who is present in all beings, all pervading, He pervaded his mind completely. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Ananya chetasa iti | Sarva bhaagavatah chitta vrutteh saakalyena   
vishayatayaa aavirbhootah |***  [[388]] All the entire functioning of his mind was totally towards *Vishnu*. 



When he was doing such a deep concentrated meditation, with a steady mind, what happened later, and how Vishnu appeared before him, will all be told now by *Paraasharar*. 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying about how *Dhruva*, after obtaining the *upadesha * of the *mantra*, and the process of performing meditation on *Paramaatman*, or *upaasane*, goes in search of a sacred place, and finds the place where *Shatrughna * had built the *Mathura puri*; in that sacred place, he starts to meditate as taught by the *Saptarshis*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 6:*** ***Mareechi mukhyaih munibhih yathaa uddishtam abhoot tathaa |*** ***Aatmani ashesha devesham sthitam vishnum amanyata ||*** He starts meditating intensely on *Vishnu*, as taught by *Mareechi * and the *rishis*, and as time passes, he meditates so intensely and concentratedly, he started to meditate with his entire mind, as though *Vishnu * was present in his entire mind. He did *dhaarana*, focussed completely on Vishnu, as *Mareechi * and other *rishis * wanted him to perform. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Mareechi mishraih iti | Amanyata dadyou |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 7:*** ***Ananya chetasah tasya dhyaayato bhagavaan harih |*** ***Sarva bhoota gato vishnuh sarva bhaava gato abhavat ||*** He never thought of anything else other than *Vishnu*, and he started meditating thus. At that time, *Hari*, who was the object of meditation, who  [[389]] is present in all beings, for his mind and thinking, there was nothing else which was the object of his thinking. Vishnu became completely the object of his thoughts. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Ananya chetasa iti | Sarva bhaagavatah chitta vrutteh saakalyena   
vishayatayaa aavirbhootah |*** *Vishnu * became the object of his meditation, completely. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 8:*** ***Manasi avasthite tasmin vishnou maitreya yoginah |*** ***Na shashaaka dharaa bhaaram udvodhum bhoota dhaarinee ||*** When *Vishnu * filled the mind of the yogi completely like that, the earth which supports all beings, could not tolerate the weight of *Dhruva* because *Vishnu * was completely filled in him. 



*Paraasharar * calls *Dhruva * as a *yogi * here. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * had commented earlier that *ashtaanga yoga * was taught as an accessory of his meditation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Manasi iti | Na shashaaketi | Garimaakhya siddhih aaseet iti arthah |*** There are *ashta siddhis*, eight types of *siddhis*, which are told for *Yogis, **animaa, mahimaa, garimaa, laghimaa, praapti, praakaamya, eeshatva, **vashitva. Garimaa * is told, which means that he became very heavy. Earth was not able to tolerate him due to the meditation on *Vishnu*. 



 [[390]] *Animaa mahimaa chaiva garimaa laghimaa tathaa |* *Praaptih praakaamyam eeshatvam vashitvam cha ashta siddhayah ||* *Yogis * can become very subtle and enter into something, they can become very heavy also. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 9:*** ***Vaama paada sthite tasmin na naamaarddhena medhinee |*** ***Dviteeyam cha nanaamaarddham kshiteh dakshinatah sthite ||*** When *Dhruva * was meditating standing, for sometime he would stand on his left leg, and sometime on his right leg. When he was standing on his left leg, that half of the hemisphere of the earth just bent and swung down, not able to tolerate the weight. When he stood on the right leg, the other half of the earth went down, not able to bear the weight. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 10:*** ***Paadaangushthena sampeedya yadaa sa vasudhaam sthitah |*** ***Tadaa samastaa vasudhaa chachaala saha parvataih ||*** After some time, he stood with half of his thumb of his foot, supporting his entire body. Then, the entire earth, with all the mountains, shook up because of not able to tolerate his weight. That is the power of his *tapas*, meditation. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 11:*** ***Nadyo nadaa samudraah cha samkshobham paramam yayuh |*** ***Tat kshobhaat amaaraah kshobham param jagmuh mahaamune ||***  [[391]] All the oceans, rivers and streams, were completely disturbed. Because of that, the earth got shaken up and disturbed, the gods could not tolerate that, and were highly disturbed and thrown out of balance. 





This is normally what the *devaas * do. When one does great penance and please the deity whom they are meditating upon, the deity is obliged to give them the boon; they get the position they ask. If one is meditating to attain the *Indra padavi*, when the meditation matures, that deity has to appear and grant him the boon that he desires. Like this, all the gods have attained their places. Whenever someone starts to meditate, they are all highly disturbed and feel that someone will come and occupy their position and they will lose their position and power. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 12:*** ***Yaamaa naama tadaa devaa maitreya paramaakulaah |*** ***Indrena saha sammantrya dhyaana bhangam prachakramuh ||*** The *Yaama * gods got worried and disturbed, they discussed with *Indra*, and they wanted to disturb or break the meditation, concentration of *Dhruva*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yaamaa iti | Yaamaah svaayambhuva manvantare devaah |*** In the *Svaayambhuva manvantara*, there were a class of *devaas * called *Yaamaas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 13:*** ***Kooshmaandaah vividhaih roopaih sahendrena mahaamune |*** ***Samaadhi bhangam atyantam aarabdhaah kartum aaturaah ||***  [[392]] At that time, *Kooshmaandaas * took different forms, along with Indra, and wanted to somehow break his concentration, meditation, *tapas*. They started to try all kinds of things to break his meditation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kooshmaandaah iti | Kooshmaandaah upadeva bhedaah |*** *Kooshmaandaas * are another sub class of gods. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 14:*** ***Suneetirnaama tat maataa saasraa tat puratah sthitaa |*** ***Putreti karunaam vaacham aaha maayaa mayee tadaa ||*** At that time, his mother by name *Suneeti*, with tears in her eyes, stood in front of him. She called *Dhruva * as "O my son", with a heart breaking tone. She was a *Maayaa Suneeti*, not the real *Suneeti. Kooshmaandaas * took on a form like *Suneeti*, came crying in front of *Dhruva * and called him with great sorrow. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 15:*** ***Putraka asmaat nivartasva shareeraatyaya daarunaat |*** ***Nirbandhito mayaa labdho bahubhih tvam manorathaih ||*** You are torturing your body with this fierce tapas, fierce meditation, which is very harsh. Please do retire from this. Stop this meditation. I had so much of desire and so many wishes of you, and because of that, I got you as my son. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 16:***  [[393]] ***Deenaam ekaam parityaktum anaathaatvam na tvam arhasi |*** ***Sapatneet vachanaat vatsa agateh tvam gatih mama ||*** I am under so much grief. I have so much sorrow. You should not be deserting me. I do not have anybody to help me look after me. You should not desert me. Listening to the other wife of the king, you have deserted me. I don't have anyone who can take care of me. You only have to look after me. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 17:*** ***Kva cha tvam pancha varsheeyah kvacha etat daarunam tapah |*** ***Nivartataam manah kashthaat nirbandhaat phala varjitaat ||*** You are only just five year old, whereas this penance you are doing is extremely fierce. This does not befit your age. In such a difficult religious practice that you have got into, please do turn away from that. Also, it does not give you any fruit. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Kva iti | Nirbandhah abhiniveshah |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 18:*** ***Kaalah kreedanakaanaam te tat ante adhyayanasya te |*** ***Tatah samasta bhogaanaam tat ante cha eeshyate tapah ||*** When one is a small child, just play with the various sports with the instruments of sports; that is your pastime. At the end of that, when you are a young boy, you should study the *Vedaas*. After that, you get into marriage and enjoy all kinds of worldly pleasures. At the end of that, during the last  [[394]] phase of your life, you will get into tapas. This is normally how people follow. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 19:*** ***Kaalah kreedanahaanaam yah tava baalasya putraka |*** ***Tasmin tvam icchasi tapah kim naashaaya aatmano ratah ||*** You are just a small boy. Now, this is the time for you to play with all other boys. At this point of time, when it is time for you to play, you are desiring to do this kind of fierce penance. You are destroying yourself. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 20:*** ***Mat preetih paramo dharmo vayovasthaa kiyaakramam |*** ***Anuvartasva maa mohaat nivartyasmaat adharmatah ||*** You have to look after me, you have to please me. This is your sacred duty. According to your are, this is what you have to do. Don't get deluded and get into this kind of *tapas * which does not befit you. Please turn away from what you are doing, which is *adharma*.

When he is eligible for *upanayana, sandhyaavandanaa * is told. Like this, according to age, different duties are prescribed. There is a *Puraana vachana*, that when one's mother is suffering, if he goes to *punya teertha*, it is a waste; if one does *daana * also, it is a waste; if one does *japa * also, it is wasted; if one does *homa*, it is also wasted; such a person engaged in all these activities, thinking that they are all *dharma*, when his mother is suffering, he is wasting his time, his entire life doing *adharma * only. What is against my good, my wish, and also it is not suiting your age; because of these, you are doing *adharma*, turn away from that. This is what *Maayaa Suneeti * is telling. There is another *paatha *- whatever are the duties according to your age, you follow that in order to please me. What one wants to do, that is not superior to doing the service of father, mother, guru. If they permit, then only it is a superior dharma which will do all kinds of good. If parents permit them to do some dharma, even if it is ridiculed by all others, it is dharma only; this is told in *Mahaabhaarata*. Like this, she is telling him to turn away from this *daaruna tapas*, this fierce penance. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 21:*** ***Parityajati vatsa adya yadi etat na bhavaan tapah |*** ***Tyakshyaami aham iha praanaan tato ve pashyatah tava ||*** If you do not turn away from this tapas, O *Dhruva*, I am going to commit suicide in front of you. I am going to put an end to this life. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 22:*** ***Sri Paraasharah -*** ***Taam pralaapavateem evam baashpaavilavilochanaam |***  [[396]] ***Samaahita manaa vishnou pashyan api na drushtavaan ||*** *Sri Paraasharar *- When she is crying like this, and her eyes completely filled with tears, his mind was so much concentrated on *Vishnu*, that even though he was opening his eyes, he was not seeing anything. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Taam iti | Pashyan api vyaapaarita chaksuh indriyo api, prayukta   
baahyendriyo api vaa |*** Though he was opening his eyes, and moving his eyes, he never saw her, he never recognized her. His mind was completely focussed on Vishnu.

Please do turn away and run.

They raised their weapons ready to hit, their faces were all throwing fire; with that kind of fierce, the demons started running towards him. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 25:***  [[397]] ***Tato naadaanateeva ugraan raaja putrasya te purah |*** ***Mumuchuh deepta shastraani bhraamayanto nishaacharaah ||*** They made fierce noises, shouted very fierce fully, and threw all kinds of fiery weapons.

None of his sense organs could sense what was happening around, though the jackals were howling, and demons were making fearful noises and wielding weapons. He was so much engrossed in *Vishnu*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 30:*** ***Ekaagra chetaah satatam vishnum eva atra samshrayam |*** ***Drushtavaan pruthivee naatha putro na anyam kathamchana ||*** He saw nothing. He saw only *Vishnu * who was completely filled in his mind. He had focussed his mind single mindedly on *Vishnu*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 31:*** ***Tatah sarvaasu maayaasu vileenaasu punah suraah |*** ***Samkshobham paramam jagmuh tat paraabhava shankitaah ||*** Gods tried all kinds of tricks, taking all kinds of forms, making all kinds of noises. All their tricks failed completely. All their *maayaas * vanished. They thought that they are going to lose to this small boy's power of meditation, and were highly disturbed in their mind. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 34:*** ***Dine dine kalaa leshaih shashaankah pooryate yathaa |*** ***Tathaa ayam tapasaa deva prayaat vruddhim aharnisham ||*** Just as the moon gets bigger and bigger every single day, like that, he is growing, his power is growing day and night.

Please make him turn away from this *tapas*. 



*Devaas * go and surrender unto *Vishnu * as they are scared of losing their position and powers.  [[400]] 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 36:*** ***Na vidmah kim sa shakratvam sooryatvam kim abheepsyasi |*** ***Vittapa ambupa somaanaam saabhilaashah pradeshu kim ||*** We do not know whether he is desiring to become *Indra * itself, or to become *Aaditya*. We are going to lose our positions and powers. Or whether he is interested in attaining the position of *Kubera *\(the lord of wealth\), *Varuna *\(the lord of waters\), or *Soma*.

He saw Him and bowed down in great devotion.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 47:*** ***Kim vadaami stutaavasya kena uktena asya samstutih |*** ***Iti aakulamatih devam tam eva sharanam yayou ||*** He was thinking - 'What is the *stuti * that I am going to tell', 'How do I praise Him', 'What *stotras * that I tell in order to eulogize *Bhagavaan*', he was worried in his mind about what to do. Not knowing anything, he just surrendered unto Him only.

There are two additional *shlokaas * given here.

***Tvat bhakti pravanam hi etat parameshvara me manah |*** ***Stotum kaamayate vishno tatra prajnyaam prayaccha me ||*** My mind is completely filled with devotion for You.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Shankha praantena iti | Vidyaa kosha shankha iti bhagavat shaastre   
astra bhooshana adhyaaye cha darshanaat |*** In the *Aagamaas * and the *Astra Bhooshana Adhyaaya*, it is told that the *shankha * encompasses all knowledge. With that *shankha, **Bhagavaan * touched *Dhruva's * cheek.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 50:***  [[406]] ***Atha prasanna vadanah sa kshanaat nrupanandanah |*** ***Tushtaava pranato bhootvaa bhoota dhaataaram achyutam ||*** Immediately on being touched by the *Shankha, Dhruva * started to eulogize *Bhagavaan * in a most wonderful way. He bowed down in reverence to *Bhagavaan*, who supports all beings, *Achyuta*. 



This is well known as *Dhruva Stuti*. He starts to eulogize *Bhagavaan * in a most wonderful way. There are explanations and commentary for this *Dhruva Stuti*. We will take this up in the next class. *Dhruva * gets the knowledge to eulogize *Bhagavaan * because he was touched by the *Shankha * of *Bhagavaan*. 



We studied today how *Dhruva * did *ghora tapas*, and nobody could disturb him. And how *Vishnu * revealed Himself to that small boy, and grants him whatever he desires. First he desires to eulogize *Bhagavaan*. 





***Recap***: In the previous session, we had just started to study the *Dhruva **Stuti. Dhruva*, a small 5 year old boy, wonderfully meditated upon *Sri **Vishnu*, with the *Dwaadashaakshara Mantra * taught by *Saptarshis*. So intense was his *dhyaana*, and he was meditating with so much devotion, that finally *Vishnu * appears right in front of him. When *Dhruva * sees the grand form of *Vishnu * in front of him, he does not know how to pray and what to do, he surrenders unto *Bhagavaan * seeking His grace. *Bhagavaan * touches him with the divine conch, and immediately *Dhruva * gets the *divya jnyaana*, and starts to eulogize *Bhagavaan. Paraasharar * continues to tell *Maitreya * how *Dhruva * prays to *Bhagavaan*. 



*Dhruva * praises *Bhagavaan * and says that everything is *Bhagavaan * only. He tells *Mahaavishnu * that 'You are only everything right from *achetana * [[407]] *prakruti * to all the modifications and states in which *prakruti * exists'. The *baddha*, the *muktaas*, everything that exists is *Bhagavaan * only. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 51:*** ***Dhruva uvaacha -*** ***Bhoomih aapo analo vaayuh kham mano buddhih eva cha |*** ***Bhootaadih aadi prakrutih yasya roopam nato asmi tam ||*** *Pruthivi, ap, tejas, vaayu, aakaasha *- the *pancha bhootaas * are told here. This also includes the *tanmaatraas, manas, buddhi. Manas * includes the other sense organs also the *jnyaanendriyaas * and *karmendriyaas*. This is *upalakshana. Buddhi * is *mahaan, mahat tattva. Bhootaadi * is *ahamkaara*, from which *pancha bhootaas * are created. *Aadi prakruti * is *pradhaana, **avyakta*. All these are Whose form, that *Bhagavaan*, I bow down to. 



*Pancha bhootaas, tanmaatraas, ahamkaara, mahat tattva, pradhaana*, everything is Your *shareera * only. You are *antaryaami * existing in everything. In this way, all the words denote *Paramaatman * only, *Vedaih cha sarvaih **aham eva vedyah*. Before *naama roopa vyaakarana, **Bhagavaan * does *anupravesha*, and does *naama roopa vyaakarana*. All names and forms in the ultimate sense denote *Paramaatman * only. This is what *Dhruva * is eulogizing *Bhagavaan * that 'You are only *pradhaana*, You are only *mahat tattva*, You are only *ahamkaara*, all these are Your forms only. That *Bhagavaan * who is existing in all these forms, I bow down to You'. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Bhoomih iti | Bhoomi aadi grahanam tanmaatraanaam api   
upalakshanam, namo grahanam dashendriyaanaam | Buddhih mahaan |   
Bhootaadih ahamkaarah | Aadi prakrutih pradhaanam |*** 





 [[408]] After the *achetana * forms, *Dhruva * is eulogizing *Bhagavaan * as existing in the embodied souls, the *baddha chetanaas*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 52:*** ***Shuddha sookshmo akhila vyaapee pradhaanaat paratah pumaan |*** ***Yasya roopam namah tasmai purushaaya gunaatmane ||*** The *jeevaatman * who is pervading in all the bodies, in every embodied soul, as an individual self who pervades within the body, with his *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*. He is present in all bodies, He is pervading each body with his *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and is *shuddha * by his very nature. He is associated with *prakruti * and experiences the *sattva, rajas, tamas*, the effects. This is telling about the *baddha purusha*. He is very subtle, *anu **svaroopi*, the *jeevaatman*. He is superior to *pradhaana*, the *achetana*. This is also *Bhagavaan's * form only. *Bhagavaan * only is in that form. Everything is His body, all are His *prakaaraas*, modes. That *Bhagavaan * who is existing in this form, I bow down to You. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Shuddha iti | Shuddhah svatah | Akhila vyaapee prati kshetram   
vyaapee | Jnyaanena vaa vyaapee | Gunaashinaa iti paathaantaram |   
Gunaashee guna bhoktaa |*** 





Now, he is eulogizing *Bhagavaan * as *mukta roopi*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 53:*** ***Bhootaadeenaam samastaanaam gandhaadeenaam cha shashvatah |*** ***Buddhyaadeenaam pradhaanasya purushasya cha yah parah ||*** One who is superior to the *baddha jeevaatman * is *mukta jeevaatman*. The *pancha bhootaas*, the *mahat, ahamkaara*, and all the *tattvaas*,  [[409]] the *pradhaana, avyakta*, the *baddha purushaas *- above all these is the *muktaaatma*. You are only the *antaryaami, antaraatman * of all that. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Mukta roopam aaha - bhootaadeenaam iti | Purushah baddhah |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 54:*** ***Tam brahma bhootam aatmaanam ashesha jagatah patim |*** ***Prapadye sharanam shuddham tvat roopam parameshvara ||*** That form also, which is Yours, which is *shuddha*, most pure, *Paramaatman*, You who are existing in all these forms, I surrender unto You. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tam iti | Brahma bhootam apahata paapmatva aadi brahma dharma

svaaraat bhavati \* Aapnoti svaaraajyam \* iti shruteh |*** There is a *paathaantara * called *jagatah param. Brahma bhootam * means that he has not become *Paramaatman * Himself. It means that he has attained *Parabrahman's * qualities, *apahata paapmatva, vijarah, vimrutyuh, **vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, satya kaamah, satya sankalpah*. The *muktaatman * has attained these *ashta gunaas * in full form, as he has got rid of the *karma bandha*. As he gets rid of the *karma bandha*, he is said to be *svaraat*. He is above all the *bhootaas*. You are also existing in the form of the *muktaas*. To You, who are existing in this form, I bow down to You. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 55:***  [[410]] ***Bruhatvaat brahmanatvaat cha yat roopam brahma sanjnyitam |*** ***Tasmai namaste sarvaatman yogi chintya avikaarine ||*** This is the definition of *Brahman*, which is also given by *Sri Bhaashyakaarar*. By itself, it is huge. It can make something also attain that mighty form. *Dhruva * is eulogizing *Bhagavaan's divya roopa * itself, directly. He is *bruhat*. He can also make something else attain that form. *Jeevaatmans * attain *aanantya * in their *dharma bhoota jnyaana * when they attain *moksha*. Their *dharma bhoota jnyaana * is *sankuchita * in the bound state. When they attain liberation, *Paramaatman * makes *jeevaatman's **dharma bhoota jnyaana * become *ananta*, just as equal to *Paramaatman*. *Paramaatman * makes *jeevaatman * also become *bruhat * in terms of attributive nature. He is *eka roopa*, unchanged, immutable. The second *roopa * is *divya mangala vigraha*. His *divya mangala vigraha * is also like that. His form can only be meditated upon by *yogis*, can be perceived only by *yogis * in *dhyaana*. He is the self of everything. To You who are existing in all these forms, I bow down to You. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Divya svaroopam aaha - bruhatvaat iti | \* Samastaasshaktayah cha

Everything is supported by Him, existing in Him. *Brahma * is the *samjnye*, name for *Paramaatman*. In the *nitya **vibhooti, kaala * does not have any control. *Kaala * which is divided into *kalaa, **muhoorta, kaashtha, paksha, samvatsara*, does not have any control in *Parama Pada, Nitya Vibhooti*. When *Nitya Vibhooti * is itself like that, what to tell of *Paramaatman's Divya Mangala Vigraha*? That is also *nitya*, eternal. 





 [[411]] Now, *Dhruva * starts to eulogize *Bhagavaan * very similar to the *Purusha **Sookta*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 56:*** ***Sahasra sheershaa purushah sahasraakshah sahasra paat |*** ***Sarva vyaapee bhuvah sparshaat atyatishtat dashaangulam ||*** Here, *Dhruva * is eulogizing the divine nature of *Paramaatman*. Thousand heads, thousand eyes, thousand feet.

It is not just the limbs and head; it denotes the *jnyaana * and *shakti * of *Paramaatman*. Because of this, His *vyaapti, * pervasion is also everywhere, unending. By telling the head, all the parts of the body are indicated. The head is the abode, controlling place of all the *jnyaanendriyaas * and *karmendriyaas*. *Shiras **shabda * indicates *jnyaana * and *shakti*, which are *ananta*. The head controlling the sense organs, the effects are denoted here. The declension of this *shiras **shabda * is told as knowing, meditating or thinking, listening, touching, sight, taste, smelling - all these are controlled there; all these are digested there and everything is processed in the head; this is why *shiras * is said to be the *nirvachana * of that. By all these explanations, we can understand that the *Purusha * having thousand heads means *Purusha * who is having innumerable, unending, *ananta jnyaana * and *shakti*. There is no limit to His powers and knowledge. This is being told clearly in these words. *Sahasra **aksha * means *aanantya * of *jnyaana*, *sahasra paat * means *aanantya * of *shakti*; because *akshi * indicates *jnyaanendriya * and foot indicates *karmendriya*. *Akshi shabda * indicates all the *jnyaanendriyaas*, and the *paada shabda * indicates all the *karmendriyaas*. Here, *Bhagavaan * is not told as having all the limbs, we have to understand it as the effects of all that, the functions performed by the *jnyaanendriyaas * and *karmendriyaas*; the *aanantya * of *jnyaana * and *shakti * is to be understood here. What is  [[413]] the *pramaana * for this? *Shvetaashvatara Upanishad * says that 'He does not have *deha * and *indriyaas * like we have. We get all of these because of the *karmaas * to experience the results of the *karmaas*. He is *karmaadhyaksha*, and so does not have body and *indriyaas * like ours. For Him, there is no one who is equal or above Him. All His *jnyaana kriya, bala **kriya * are natural to Him. He is endowed with innumerable varieties of powers'. Nobody can imagine His powers, and nobody can say that He is like this, He is not like this, He can be anything in any form in any way. *Yo vetti **yugapat sarvam pratyakshena sadaa svatah*, is what *Swami **Yaamunaachaarya * says in his *Nyaaya Tattva mangala shloka*. He is one who knows at the same time, everything, He perceives directly, all the time, by Himself. This is the *sarvajnyatva * of *Bhagavaan*. He can perceive everything directly all the time, either with using the *indriyaas*, or without using the *indriyaas*, with body or without body, with limbs or without limbs, He has such wonderful unimaginable powers and capabilities. The *Paramaatma **svaroopa * nobody can fully understand or perceive that. *Shruti * is clearly declaring all these qualities of *Paramaatman*, 'He does not have hands and legs like us, He can move around anywhere, and He can hold anything'. *Srivatsaanka Mishra * tells 'When we read about *Sahasra sheershah **purushah, sahasra aaksha, sahasra paat*, when we imagine with our human heads and eyes, and feet, it will look like a very ugly form; it is not like this; *shalali* is porcupine and *shalala * is the quill of the porcupine, porcupine's body is filled with quills, and it looks very ugly with the quills all over, *Bhagavaan's* form is not ugly like that; *Bhagavaan's * form is not filled with heads and eyes and feet all over His body just like the quill of a porcupine, then how else is this to be imagined? It is like one who has eyes which can see to any end, unending, unlimited sight, limbs which can reach to any place, end of anything, He can see everything and do everything'. *Taittiriya Aaranyaka * says that 'I was here before itself', *Purusha * who is described in the *Purusha Sookta * is the Creator of everything, He was present before anything else was present, that is the *Purushatva * of Him, one who exists before anything else. He fills everything, there is nothing which is not *bhagavat aatmaka*. He is residing everywhere, that is why He is said to be *Purusha*. The *nirvachana * of *Purusha **shabda * is given in many ways - *puri shete*, one who resides in the body, He resides in all beings, all bodies, He is *Purusha*; He fills everything, He is said  [[414]] to be *Purusha*; He was present before anything else, He is *Purusha*. What exists, what becomes is *bhooh*. It is not *mithya * or *asat*, it is *sat*; it exists in all beings, sentient or non sentient, everything is indicated by *bhuvah. **Dashaangulam * is not just ten inches, but it is of huge proportion. He stands above all these things, exceeding everything, as He pervades everything. Having touched the entire world consisting of the sentient and non sentient, He stands above and beyond everything. *Mahaa Naaraayanopanishad * says 'By whom is pervaded the *antariksha loka, dyu loka, pruthivi loka*, everything, He is the One. Whatever is seen or heard in this world, *Naaraayana * exists pervading it from inside or outside'. *Jagat * is *vyaapya*, that which is pervaded; *Vyaapaka*, one who pervades, is the *Purusha*. This is told very clearly in all these *Shruti pramaanaas*. His greatness is told because He pervades everything.

From You only, all these are created. 



Here, the *Purusha Sookta mantra * is ' *Purusha evedagam sarvam yat bhootam **yat cha bhavyam ... *'; this *shloka * is very similar to the *Purusha Sookta*.

And everything exists for His sake only. Everything is from You. *Avyakta shareera Aniruddha * is indicated by *Viraat. Aniruddha * is a *vyooha avataara * who does *srushti*, and *pralaya*. He is one who performs the *yajnya*, He Himself is the *yajnya*. Everything is from Him only. He is only everything. That *Viraat purusha * is said to be *Aniruddha. Samraat * is said to be one who has attained *Parama **Pada*, indicates *mukta. Akshara * is said to be *kevala aatmaa, * one who has attained the *kaivalya*. In *Vaayu Puraana, viraat, svaraat * and *samraat * are told as various *lokaas*, worlds. This *loka * is said to be *samraat. Antariksha **loka * is said to be *viraat. Svaraat * is another *loka*. Everything exists for *Paramaatman*, He is the *shareeri. Adhikaari purusha * is *Chaturmukha **Brahma*, or it can mean that 'Taking You as the support, or locus, *Hiranya **Garbha * was born, so he is said to be *adhipoorusha*'. The *aatma samashti **roopa*, the collectivity of all individual selves, is said to be *Hiranya **Garbha * also. From You only, all these are created, supported, everything is You only. *Paramaatman's * wonderful *svaroopa * is told here.

Whatever belongs to one, all those things in the form of *purodaasha*, are all offered as oblation, this is said to be *sarva hutah*. In this *yajnya * of creation, everything in the form of *purodaasha*, everything belonging to one, are offered as *purodaasha*; this is said to be *sarva hutah. **Prushadaajyam * means ghee mixed with curd. Two types of *pashus * are those animals which live in the forest, and those which live in the cities. 



 [[417]] This is told similarly in *Purusha Sookta * as ' *Tripadoordhva udet purushah **paadosyehaa bhavaat punah ... Tasmaat viraat ajaayata ... Yat purushena **havishaa ... Tasmaat yajnyaat sarva hutah ...' * 



These are telling about creation as told in *Purusha Sookta*.

You did the *pravartana * of all that. All the *Yajurveda mantraas * came out of You. The horses, and those animals which have jaw on only one side, the lower jaw alone, cows, buffaloes, etc. 



This is told in *Purusha Sookta * as ' *Tasmaat yajnyaat sarva hutah, ruchah **saamaani jajnyre ... Tasmaat ashvaah ajaayanta ...' *

From You only, the ewe, sheep, and all deer, animals were born. From Your face the *Braahmanaas * were born. From Your arms, the *Kshatriyaas * were born. 



This is told in *Purusha Sookta * as *'Braahmano asya mukham aaseet, baahu **raajaanyah krutah ...' * 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Gaava iti | Teshu mahishaadishu gavaadeh pruthak yuktih

From Your feet, *Shoodraas * were born. From Your eyes, Sun was born. From Your *praana, Vaayu * was created. From Your mind, the moon was created. 



This comes in *Purusha Sookta * as ' *Chandramaa manaso jaatah, chakshoh **sooryo ajaayata ...' *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 63:*** ***Praano \(Praanaan\) nah sushiraat jaato mukhaat agnirajaayata |*** ***Naabhito gaganam dyouh cha shirasah samavartata ||*** From the *vaayu * which was existing in the nostrils, or from the *mukhya **praana, praana * was created. *Praana * is one of the functions of the *pancha **praanaas, praana, apaana, vyaana, udaana, samaana*. From Your mouth, *Agni * was created. From Your navel, the sky was created. From Your head, the *dyu loka * was created.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 64:*** ***Dishah srotraat kshitih padbhyaam tvattah sarvam abhoot idam |*** From Your ears, the directions were created. From Your feet, the *bhoomi*, earth was created. From You only, all these were created. 



*Dhruva * is eulogizing *Bhagavaan * just as in *Purusha Sookta*, telling about how everything was created from *Bhagavaan*. The greatness of *Purusha Sookta * is that it comes in all the four *Vedaas. Bhaashyakaarar * mentions this in *Vedaartha Sangraha*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 65:*** ***Nyagrodhah sumahaan alpe yathaa beeje vyavasthitah |***  [[420]] ***Samyame vishvam akhilam beeja bhoote tathaa tvayee ||*** In the subtle seed, the whole *nyagrodha * tree is existing. In the same way, during *pralaya*, the entire world is existing in You in the form of that seed. 



This is also the example given in *Shvetaketu * and *Uddhalaka's * dialog in *Chandogya Upanishad*, how the entire world can be created by something which is not seen. *Uddhalaka * takes the example of a *nyagrodha vruksha*, tree, and take a seed of it and break it. When *Shvetaketu * breaks it, he sees a small part of it; *Uddhalaka * asks to break it further, and *Shvetaketu * says that he does not see anything. From this seed which you don't see, a huge *nyagrodha * tree is created. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Nyagrodha iti | Samyame samhaare |*** 



Further, *Dhruva * continues to eulogize *Bhagavaan*, in a most wonderful way, how creation happens, etc. ***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Dhruva Stuti*, where he is eulogizing *Paramaatman*, very similar to *Purusha Sookta*, the way *Shruti * eulogizes *Bhagavaan*, extolling the way in which He created everything. In the same way, *Dhruva * also did *stuti * of *Bhagavaan*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 63:*** ***Praano \(Praanaan\) nah sushiraat jaato mukhaat agnirajaayata |*** ***Naabhito gaganam dyouh cha shirasah samavartata ||*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 64:***  [[421]] ***Dishah srotraat kshitih padbhyaam tvattah sarvam abhoot idam |*** 



All the *gagana, dyu loka, agni, praana*, everything was created from *Paramaatman*, the directions were created from His ears; from His feet, the *Bhoo loka * was created. Everything came out of You. 





He gives an example for this. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 65:*** ***Nyagrodhah sumahaan alpe yathaa beeje vyavasthitah |*** ***Samyame vishvam akhilam beeja bhoote tathaa tvayee ||*** How a huge mighty *Nyagrodha * tree is created from a minute seed, how a mighty *Nyagrodha * tree is present in a small seed. In the same way, during *pralaya*, the entire world, having the variety of objects, sentient and non-sentient, is present in You, who is like the seed. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Nyagrodha iti | Samyame samhaare |*** 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 66:*** ***Beejaat ankura sambhooto nyagrodhah tu samucchritah |*** ***Vistaaram cha yathaa yaati tvayaa srushtam tathaa jagat ||*** From the seed of the *Nyagrodha*, the sprout comes, how the mighty *Nyagrodha * tree grows, the mighty branches, leaves and flowers, in the same way, this whole world has come out of You, who is like the seed. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 67:***  [[422]] ***Yathaa hi kadalee naanyaa tvak patraat atha drushyate |*** ***Evam vishvasya naanyastvam tvat sthaayee eeshvara drushyate ||*** The banana tree is made of the stem, skin, leaves; and everything is said to be the plantain tree only. The plantain tree is not different from its stem, or skin or leaves. In the same way, You are no different from this whole world; You are one with it, and everything is present in You. 



This is a very important *siddhaanta * we have to understand, and this is also established in the *Brahma Sutraas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Yathaa iti | Yathaa cha kaarana bhootaa baalatvak patraavasthaa   
kadalee sva kaarya bhoota sthoolatvak patraat naanyaa saa eva cha

bhootah tripaat roopena tvam drushyase | \* Vyatiriktam na yasya asti   
vyatirikto akhilasya yah \* Tripaadasyaamrutam divi \* ityaadi |*** Just as the young state of a plantain tree with small leaves and skin, which is just beginning to come out, and is the cause of the gross state of the plantain tree with huge leaves, and big skin; the small sprout which comes out is the cause of its own effect, the small state and gross state are both called the plantain tree only; and we recognize it as the same, whatever was the sprout, is the same tree itself, in the same way, You who are the cause of this entire world, You are not different from the effect which is this whole world. The innumerable types of these objects here, You who are the cause are no different from the effect which is this whole world. This is clearly established in the *Shrutis, Smrutis. Bhagavaan * did *sankalpa * and said ' *Bahu syaam*', 'Let Me become many', and He became many. He made Himself Himself. *Svasya kaaryasya svayam eva kaaranam iti sukrutam*. Without any strain or effort, He just did *sankalpa * and became many,  [[423]] without any *aayaasa*; that is why it is called *sukruta*. For His effect, He Himself is the cause. The world is not different from Him. This is established in the *Brahma Sutra*, ' *Tat ananyatvam aarambhana shabdaadibhyah'. **Shruti * says ' *Mruttiketyeva satyam*', everything is *mrut aatmaka*, all effects are made from mud. Like this, everything is *bhagavat aatmaka*. And is *Smrutis*, it is told in *Vishnu Puraana, Jyoteemshi Vishnuh*, the various sources of light like fire, sun, moon, stars, etc. everything is *Vishnu * only; this is in *saamaanaadhikaranya*; like *Tat tvam asi*, everything is *bhagavat **aatmaka*, there is nothing which can shine without Him, *Tasya bhaasaa **sarvam idam bibhaati*, so, everything can be said to be Him only. Not only that, You are very different and distinct from this entire world, You are seen as *Tripaat roopa*. It is told in *Purusha Sookta, Paadosya vishvaa **bhootaani tripaadasyaamrutam divi*. There is nothing which is different from Him, who is different from everything; *Bhagavat svaroopa * is like that. Though He is everything, He is *antaryaami*, the inner controller of everything. Being all pervading, He is different and distinct from everything. He is untouched by any of the defects, and is having innumerable auspicious qualities, His nature is opposed to everything that is defiling, He is all pervading, controls everything, everything is His mode being His *shareera. **Tri * has the meaning of *bahutva*, three feet, like *Sahasra sheershaa **purushah, sahasraakshah sahasra paat*. The *sheersha, aksha, paat * are indicative of *jnyaana * and *shakti * of *Paramaatman*, which is incomparable. He is endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities. He is different and distinct from everything. During *pralaya*, the entire world is present in Him, in the form of a seed, like a tree is present inside a seed. He does *sankalpa, **'Bahu syaam*' and the whole world is created. He does *anupravesha * and becomes everything. 



*Dhruva * eulogizes *Paramaatman * as 'Everything is present in You, and You are not different from the world'.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 68:*** ***Hlaadinee sandhinee samvit tvayyekaa sarva samsthitou |***  [[424]] ***Hlaadataapakaree mishraa tvayi no guna varjite ||*** That which is in the form of incomparable bliss, You who are the abode and support of everything, without any break. Your *jnyaana * is *niravadhika **atishaya aananda*. 



*Samvit * means *dharma bhoota jnyaana*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Hlaadineeti | Sarva samsthitou sarvaadhaare tvayee | Samvit

Guna varjita * also includes *heya guna varjita*, without any defects. He Himself is the bliss, He is the object of such bliss, or He creates such bliss in others, both can be told. *Shruti * says ' *Vijnyaanam **aanandam brahma*', He is of the nature of *aananda*, abundant *aananda*, unlimited unparalleled bliss. One who does *upaasanaa * on *Paramaatman*, here itself, he gets *amruta*, liberated; there is no other way. His nature itself is *aananda*. When the *mukta * gets liberated and goes to *Paramaatman*, through *Paramaatman's anugraha*, he goes and joins *Paramaatman*, who is *aananda maya*, of the nature of innumerable bliss; having attained the *Paramaatman * through His grace, he also becomes *aanandi*; he enjoys the bliss equally as that if *Paramaatman*. 



This is how *Dhruva * eulogizes *Paramaatman * in the most wonderful way.  [[425]]

He created the world with innumerable objects, and He Himself is present as everything. You are only present as *pancha bhootaas*. One who became *pancha **bhootaas * means that one who is having the five elements as His *shareera*, I bow down to You. That which are present as prominent, or as many, *Chaturmukha Brahma * and all the beings - You only have become all that, You are having all that as Your *shareera*. You who have pervaded everything like this, I bow down to You. Or also, *bhoota bhootaaya * is *bhoota **sookshmaas *\(subtle state\), and *prabhoota bhoota * is *mahaa bhoota **avasthe *\(gross state\). *Bhoota * is also in the meaning of beings, One who is present in the form of all beings. I pay my obeisance to You. 



*Eka bhoota * is when He is one, in the *kaarana avasthaa*, causal state.

All of these, *vyaktam bhavaan, pradhaana purushou **bhavaan, viraat samraat svaraat bhavaan*, we have to take *anvaya * like this. *Yogis*, when they do meditation upon You, in their *antahkarana*, their inner sense organ, the mind, You reveal Yourself.

You who are present as inner controller of everything, I do *namaskaara * to You.

Then they praise King *Pruthu * with all the good qualities he will have, and all the good deeds he is going to do. *Pruthu * takes a vow that he is going to cultivate all these good qualities, and give up all the bad qualities, and that he will also do all those deeds that they have told of him. *Sootha* and *Maagadha * whatever qualities they told thus, he took all those in his mind and started to cultivate those qualities, and also performed all the deeds that they told of him.

Because, when *Vena * did not allow anyone to do *yaagaas * and other good deeds, and after his death, there was no rule and order in the kingdom, all the plants and trees got destroyed. He asked them 'Why have you come here?'. They told him the reason why they have come.

This is explained in detail in other *Puraanaas, Maatsya Puraana*, etc.

For each one, it was different. Whatever they wanted according to their nature, they milked those things from *Pruthivi. Devaas, munis, daityaas * are all the *yajamaanaas * who perform the *yajnya. Soorya, Bruhaspati*, etc. were in the form of *dogdhru*, the person who milks the cow. *Indra, Soma*, etc. were the calves for the ten groups. *Sourvarna, Chandomaya*, etc. were the ten vessels. *Balam, Tapa*, etc. were the ten varieties of milk, this is told in the *Maatsya Puraana*.

*Devaas * got the cow milked. They are the *yajamaanaas*. The person who milked was *Soorya*, for the *Devaas*. For *Munis*, the *dogdhru * was *Bruhaspati*. For *Daityaas*, it was *Dvimoordha*. For *Raakashasaas*, it was *Jatunaabha*. For *Adris*, mountains, it was *Meru*. For *Gandharvaas*, it was *Vasuruchi*. For *Uragaas*, snakes, it was *Dhrutaraashtra*. For *Yakshaas*, it was *Suparna*. For *Pitrus*, it was *Antaka, Yama*. For *Tarus*, it was *Saala*. The *Vatsa*, calf for these were *Indra, Soma, Virochana, Sumaali, Himavat, Chitraratha, **Takshaka, Kubera, Maya, Plaksha*, in order. The vessel in which they collected were *Souvarna *\(Gold vessel for *Devaas*\), *Chandomaya *\(vessel of *Veda * for *Munis*\), *Aayasam *\(vessel iron for the *Daityaas*\), *Kaapaala * for the *Raakshasaas, Shaila *\(crystal\) for the *Adris, Padma patra *\(lotus leaves\) for *Gandharvaas, Alaavu *\(gourd\) for the *Uragaas, Apakva **mrunmaya *\(uncooked earth\) for the *Yakshaas, Raajata *\(silver vessel\) for the *Pitrus, Paalaasha * for the *Tarus*. The milk that they obtained from *Pruthivi*, is the seed for everything; it got converted into whatever they desired - *Devaas * got *bala*, superhuman power; *Munis * milked tapas; *Daityaas * milked *maayaa; Raakshasaas * milked *rudhira*, blood; Mountains milked *oshadhees * and *ratna*, gems and trees,  [[475]] plants; *Gandharvaas * milked *gandha; Uragaas * milked poison; *Yakshaas * milked *antardhaana*, the *vidyaa * to disappear; *Pitrus * milked *svadhaa*; and *Tarus * milked *punah prarohana*. 



*Pruthvi * said that she would provide everything in the form of milk. This is the seed for all kinds of things digested, and will get converted to whatever they desire. Using the proper *dogdhru*, with the proper calf, with the proper vessel, they get the desired fruits, the *ksheera*, milk. *Devaas * making *Soorya * as the *dogdhru*, Indra as the calf, in the golden vessel, they milked *bala*, superhuman power. *Rishis*, making *Bruhaspati * as the *dogdhru, Soma * as the calf, *Vedaas * as the vessel, milked *tapas*. Like this, each of the ten groups is told.

She became *Dhaatree, **Vidhaatree, Dhaarinee *\(support\), *Poshanee *\(nourisher\), etc. of all.

He was looking after the welfare of all people, and was very kind and compassionate. Everyone liked him very much. So he was called *Raajaa*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 13, Shloka 94:*** ***Ya idam janma vainyasya pruthoh sankeertayet narah |*** ***Na tasya dushkrutam kinchit phaladaaye prajaayate ||*** Whoever recites this birth of *Pruthu*, son of *Vena*, about all his greatness, and the great things that he achieved, whatever bad deeds he might have done, they will not give fruit \(the bad deeds will get destroyed\). 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 13, Shloka 95:*** ***Dussvapna upashamanam nruunaam shrunvataam etat adbhutam |*** ***Pruthoh janma prabhaavah cha karoti satatam shubham ||*** Those who listen to this story of *Pruthu*, his greatness, all their bad dreams will be destroyed; they will never get bad dreams. His auspicious birth, his greatness, his qualities, capabilities, whoever recites all the time, they will get all good; for them there will be no bad dreams; all their bad deeds will get destroyed.

They ask him what to do in order to continue the *prajaa vruddhi*. Father says that they have to worship *Vishnu*, who if pleased, can bestow any boon that is wanted, and you will be able to achieve this through His grace. Anything one desires, *dharma, artha, **kaama * or *moksha*, they will have to worship *Bhagavaan Purushottama, * [[484]] *Mahaa Vishnu*, and then only can they attain any of those desires. ***

Naaraayane munisreshtha sarva loka paraayane ||*** *Naaraayana * who is the ultimate goal of all beings, O Maitreya, excellent among sages, they meditated upon Him, who is the master of the entire universe, for ten thousand years.

Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Stavam iti | Yam stavam chakruh tam vaktum arhasi |   
   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 14, Shloka 22:   
Sri Paraasharah -   
Shrunu maitreya govindam yathaa poorvam prachetasah |   
Tushtuvuh tanmayee bhootaah samudra salileshayaah ||*** *Sri Paraashara *- Being completely engrossed in the thought of *Bhagavaan **Govinda*, how they eulogized Him, do listen to that. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 14, Shloka 23:   
Prachetasah oochuh -   
Nataassma sarva vachasaam pratishthaa yatra shaashvatee |   
Tam aadyantam asheshasya jagatah paramam prabhum ||*** *Prachetasaas * prayed thus to *Bhagavaan *- They pray Him as the cause of everything whatever is created, being the *antaryaami*. We prostrate unto the One, where the ultimate meaning of all words rests, He who creates the entire world, and is also the final resort of the entire world, where everything merges unto Him during *pralaya*, we prostrate unto Him. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Nataassma iti | Vachasaam yatra pratishthaa | Vaachye hi vachasaam   
pratishthaa | Pravrutti nimitta maatram hi sarvam vastu jaatam   
vachasaam, na tu pradhaanatayaa vaachyam, yathaa guna jaati   
aadikam | ****Vaachya * is the object denoted by the word, *vaak*. The word rests in the  [[486]] object which it denotes. All the words ultimately denote *Bhagavaan*, as He did *anupravesha*, and *naama roopa vyaakarana * was done by *Bhagavaan * only, so all words in the ultimate sense denote *Bhagavaan * only. If we say so, how can we used the words to denote objects, in our normal transactions? It is only for a particular purpose that we use, and the connotation of the word is limited because of our need and the way we understand. So, when we say that this is a mobile, the meaning of the word rests in that object only; in the ultimate sense it is resting in *Bhagavaan * who is *antaryaami * of everything. The primary meaning of the word goes up to the *antaryaami **Bhagavaan*, who is the inner self of all objects. When we say *gouh, **manushyah, devah*, we limit the connotations to the objects which we see and perceive, but in the ultimate sense, they all rest in *Bhagavaan * only. It is only for our transactional purposes that we limit the meanings. 



When we say that ' *Devadaatta* is a *manushya*', the purpose of that word is to make one understand the class of the person. Whereas it is not the primary meaning. The primary meaning of all words is *Bhagavaan * only. All words ultimately connote *Bhagavaan * only. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 14, Shloka 24:   
Jyotiraadyam anoupamyam anu anantam apaaravat |   
Yonibhootam asheshasya sthaavarsya charasya cha ||*** He is the cause of all movables and immovables. His wonderful lustrous form is not material, it is *apraakruta*. He is One who is present before anything else; He is the cause of everything. All luminous objects get their luminosity, shine, brightness only from *Bhagavaan*; they are not independent, they are dependent on *Bhagavaan*. There is no comparison for Him; He is incomparable. He is very *sookshma*, subtle. He is not limited by time, place of object; He is present at all times, in all places, in all objects. ***

This is how the *indriya*, the eye, travels to the object which it perceives, comes into contact, and this is how it is able to perceive the object. So, it is not staying in one place and perceiving. That is why they are called *ksharam. Akshara * is the organ of hearing, is staying in one place, and sound reaches the ear for it to be perceived. ***

Brahma had told their father that mankind has to be continued. *Bhagavaan * is very pleased with their tapas. After they come out of water, they see that the entire earth is filled with trees, which have grown too high, and even air is not able to blow, everything is blocked and choked, people are dying. They get very angry, and create *Agni * and *Vaayu; Agni * burns everything, and *Vaayu * dries up the trees, and everything starts getting destroyed. *Soma * who is the king of the trees comes in front of them, and says that there is a lady called *Maarisha*. Knowing the future that she is going to be your wife, I have protected her with my rays, and nurtured her. ***

saamarthyamrute sarveshvaram harim \* iti cha | ****Paaram param* means the end of the path of *samsaara*. End of *samsaara * is *Vishnu's Parama Pada*, one who does *upaasanaa * reaches that *Parama Pada. Bhagavaan * is in *Parama Pada*, and He is also said to be *Parama Pada*. One who is on the other end of *samsaara*, one who crosses over *samsaara * reaches Him. *Bhagavan * is also the means to cross over the *samsara*. In the unbroken tradition of *Guru * and *Shishya*, that secret *upadesha * is taught, this is told in *Chaandogya*, how it is passed on from *aachaarya * to *shishya*, in the unbroken tradition of *aachaarya shishya **paramparaa*, that can also be taken as meaning of *Paaram param. Bhagavad **Geetha pramaana * is also given here - where *Krishna * says to *Arjuna * that whatever *yoga * He is teaching him is taught in the *guru shishya paramparaa. **Apaara paara * is explained as unending powers - *Vishnu * has got *ananta **shakti*, that which cannot be told fully; this is told in *Upanishads * in many ways; His *paraa shakti * is manifold, it is natural to Him; He is *sarva shakta, **ananta shakta*. There is no end to Him. He is of incomparable proportion. He is *sarva vyaapta, vibhu*. Nobody can know Your greatness, He is *vibhu **svaroopa*, and He is *gunatah bruhatvam, svaroopatah **bruhatvam. * Or, *yajnya * and other *karmaas*, when they are not yet completed, He makes it complete when one does His *keertana*, or *smarana*, this is also the meaning of *apaara paarah*. Those *braahmanaas * who realize *Krishna * as He is, all their *yajynaas * are as good as completed. Just Your *naama sankeertana * will make everything fulfilled. He is superior to *Brahma * and others in the aspects of He is the single cause of everything, He is *upaadaana kaarana, nimitta kaarana, sarva kaarana, eka kaarana * of the entire *jagat, Chaturmukha Brahma * and others are created by Him, they are all *srujyaas*, and He is *srashta*, His *svaroopa * is *niratishaya aananda. **Paramaartha roopee * is told as He is not like *Brahma * and others, who also have a limited life span, *Brahma's * life is a hundred years, and after that he  [[514]] also gets merged into his *kaarana*, everything gets merged into *Paramaatman * in *praakruta pralaya * and again they are all created; though *chetanaas * are all *nitya*, eternal, they are born again and again as they are *karma vashyaas*. Up to *Chaturmukha Brahma*, everyone's lifespan is limited. *Paramaatman * has divine auspicious *divya mangala vigraha*, which is eternal unlike *Chaturmukha Brahma * and others. This *divya mangala **vigraha * is the abode of *sarva shakti*, all powers, it is real and auspicious and eternal. Those who attain Him, they enjoy the bliss of communion with Him, this is *parama purushaartha * for all. *Brahma paarah *- here, the meaning of word *Brahma * is *prakruti, pradhaana*, matter. The word *brahma * is used in many senses even in the *Shrutis * and *Smrutis*. He is the ultimate, the end of *pradhaana*, that is, that *pradhaana * also merges into Him during *pralaya*. Or it can also be taken as that the *vaidikaas * who have mastered the *Vedaas*, He nurtures, looks after, protects them. Meaning of *para * is the *samashti **purusha*, the collectivity of all the sentients; during *pralaya*, all sentients are merged into *avyakta. Avyaktam akshare leeyate, aksharam tamasi **leeyate*. In a form which cannot be differentiated as to what is *pradhaana*, what is *chetana*, they go and stay with *Paramaatman*, as though with *ekee **bhaava*. How can be *chetanaas * be told as *para*, means with respect to *avyakta*, they can be told as *para*, they are superior to the *avyakta*. He is the cause of *pradhaana * and *chetanaas*; both of them go and merge into *Paramaatman*, they go and stay one with Him. *Samashti purushaas * also go and join unto *Paramaatman*. He is the One who is the abode of even that during *pralaya*, everything merges unto Him. Or, one more meaning can be told as all those objects which are mutually different, they don't get mixed up, there are innumerable *chetanaas*, and every *chetana * when created will have its own body, whether it is *keeta, manushya, deva, gandharva, **yaksha, * the individual *karmaas * are all maintained, and there is no mixing up of anybody's karma with anybody else; this is called *asaankarya*. For mutually different objects, He maintains their *svabhaava, svaroopa*, separately without any two getting mixed up. He is also superior to *nityaas * and *muktaas*, because He is the cause of the entire world, and *nityaas * and *muktaas * cannot create, and cannot involve in *srushti*; in those aspects, *Bhagavaan * is superior to them, and also He is the master of all, and everything is *shesha bhoota * to Him. *Paara paarah *- first word *paara * means *kaala*, He is the resting place, or controller of *kaala * also;  [[515]] everything is resting in Him, and He is ultimate, where all realities go and stay with Him, being supported by Him, and controlled by Him. *Kaala * is the controller of everything in this *prakruti **mandala. Kaala * has no control in *Parama Pada*, where *Paramaatman * controls everything there. He is also the fulfiller of even *vyoma * and others, *vyoma * is said to be *vibhu, aakaasha*, He is *antaryaami * of *aakaasha * also; where *aakaasha * does not exist, He exists; He is *vibhu*. Everything is filled with *Paramaatman * only. He is also the protector of the protectors. But for *Hari*, who is all protector, nobody else can protect. Without His *sankalpa*, nobody can even protect anyone else. 



In this one *shloka, Kandu Maharshi * eulogizes *Paramaatman * as superior to everything else, *svetara samasta vilakshana*, He is *Parama Sheshi*. Starting with everything, *avyakta, pradhaana, samashti purushaas, muktaas, **nityaas, kaala, aakaasha*, everything is controlled by Him, and everything rests in Him. He is the sole creator of this entire world. He is superior to *Chaturmukha Brahma * and others. 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we had studied about how *Maitreyar * asks two doubts to *Paraasharar*, when he started to talk about *Daksha. **Daksha * was born to *Prachetasaas*, and earlier was also born to *Brahma * of his right thumb which was in a different *manvantara * the *Swaayambhuva **Manvantara*; now it is *Chaakshusha Manvantara *- this is how *Paraasharar * clarified that doubt. Then *Maarishaa * the daughter of *Soma*, and *Daksha * is the grandson. It is told that *Soma * marries *Daksha's * daughter. This seems like there are some inconsistencies here. All these are clarified by *Paraasharar*, as during those times, there was no concept of elder and younger for *rishis * and *devaas*, they were all very exalted and had lot of knowledge, they used to live for a long time; elder or younger was decided based on the knowledge they had and their superior powers. *Daksha * and others are born again and again, in every *yuga * and *manvantara*. Like this, all the doubts are clarified. Now, *Maitreyar * asks *Paraasharar * about *Daksha's **srushti*.

*Hiranyakashipu * continues with all the other things, to torture *Prahlaada * who is so much immersed in the thought of *Vishnu. Sri **Paraasharar * starts to continue further. We will see these in the next class. 



 [[551]] So far, we saw some wonderful *shlokaas * as told by *Prahlaada*, which are quoted in many *pramaanaas * and *vyaakhyaanaas*, about *Vishnu bhakti*. 



***Recap***: We are studying *Prahlaada's charitra*, where *Hiranyakashipu * is giving all kinds of trouble to destroy *Prahlaada*, but is failing in every attempt, because of the devotion which *Prahlaada * had. *Hiranyakashipu * sends venomous serpents, *Takshaka * and others, who could not do anything. *Prahlaada * is not even aware of his body, as he is deeply meditating on Vishnu. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 17, Shloka 39:   
Sa tu aasakta matih krushne dashyamaano mahaa uragaih |   
Na viveda aatmano gaatram tat smruti aahlaada samsthitah ||*** With the bliss of remembrance of *Paramaatman*, he did not even realize that he was in a body. He was not even aware of his body. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 17, Shloka 40:   
Sarpaah oochuh -   
Damshtraa visheernaa manayah sphutanti phaneshu taapo hrudayeshu   
kampah |   
Na asya tvachah svalpam apeeha bhinnam prashaadhi daityeshvara   
kaaryam anyat ||*** Serpents say - Our teeth are totally broken, we are experiencing terrible heat in our hood, our minds are trembling with fear. His skin was not injured even a little bit, though we are biting him with our sharp fangs. Please tell us some other work to do. We are unable to do anything to *Prahlaada*. ***

Tajjaa vinaashaaya bhavanti tasya yathaa araneh prajvalito hutaashah   
||***  [[552]] Then, he calls the *diggajaas*, elephants which are controlling the directions, with closely present tusks, and said 'Kill this boy, he is not on our side, he is on the side of the enemies. Whatever is born from him, will only be destroying me and our *vamsha*, just as fire born of *arani*, wood, destroys *arani*, wood itself'. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
He diggajaa iti | Sankateti | Chaturdantatayaa paraspara nibida danta

| ****Diggajaas * are supposed to have four tusks, which are very closely present. Because he is on the side of the enemies, he is different from us. 



When two *aranis * are rubbed against each other, the fire is created, and that fire burns the wood itself. Fire which is born of wood burns the wood itself. Like that, he will destroy our clan, says *Hiranyakashipu*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 17, Shloka 42:   
Sri Paraasharah -

How did I get that power? Because of the continuous remembrance of *Janaardana*, that is the power I have. Continuous remembrance of *Janaardana * can destroy even great *taapaas * or *paapaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Aprushto api bhagavan maahaatmya jnyaapanaaya aaha dantaa iti | ***Why did *Prahlaada * say this though he was not asked by *Hiranyakashipu*? This is to remind *Hiranyakashipu * of the greatness, and power of remembering *Bhagavaan*.

This is the truth, and is known from the *Aagamaas, Vedaas*. This is also supported by logic. We are born in this body, and experiencing happiness, sorrow right from our birth, it is the result of fruits of *karmaas * done earlier.

vyaahatam iti bhaavah |*** *Dehi * is the *aatma*, who is in the *deha*. Even after the body is destroyed, the *aatman * lives. He will get into another body. If he is not born again, even the current birth that we have cannot happen. If another birth happens, then we can actually justify our current birth. This is the *pramaana * for that, the students are learning all this in *Aagama*, 'Having died and gone from here, he is again born', 'The path in which he goes - the same path he returns here', the path of *Pitru yaana* is told, 'Having died, he will again get into *samsaara*, and again die'. Whatever is told in *Aagamaas*, is again supported by *tarka*, which is in line with what is taught in the *Aagamaas. **Tarka * is logic, which by itself cannot be an independent *pramaana * for *ateendriya vishayaas*. Logic is also useful in order to understand what is taught in the *Shrutis*, in order to also make things more firm and clear in our mind. This is against the *Chaarvaakaas*, who say that only the *Pratyaksha pramaana * is accepted, and they say that *Shruti * is not a *pramaana *- they say that *deha * is itself the *aatman*, and destruction of  [[558]] the body is itself *moksha*; they say that when the body is burnt and becomes ashes, how can it come again; this is not acceptable. The logic which *Prahlaada Aalwaar * is telling here is supporting what is taught in the *Shrutis *- that without a material cause, an effect cannot happen. If one is born, there has to be a material cause for that, and if the soul was not there, he could not have been born taking another body. In every being, what is seen is the effects of *sukha * and *dukha*. In the previous births, whatever *sukruta * and *duskhruta * which one has done, having all these, if an *aatman*, the *upaadaana kaarana*, is not there, such an experience of *sukha * and *dukha * cannot happen. The experience of *sukha * and *dukha * happens in the *aatman * himself, and he is the cause of that only. He is also *nimitta kaarana*, and also the *upaadaana kaarana*. The experience of *sukha * and *dukha * happens in the *aatman * himself, because of the virtuous deeds and sins. This is the logic used here to justify that *aatman * is permanent, and eternal, and is only born again. This is how beings are born again and again, and undergo *janma, baalya, youvana, **jaraa, mrutyu*. When they \( *Chaarvaakaas*\) say that *pratyaksha * only is the *pramaana*, they are refuted here, through this logic. ***

Garbha vaasa aadi yaavat tu punarjanma upapaadanam |   
Samasta avasthakam taavat dukham eva avagamyataam ||*** Again, he will be residing in the womb, and then he is born, the soul who is present in all these states, they all lead to sorrow only.

Kshut trushna upashamam tadvat sheetaadi upashamam sukham |   
Manyate baala buddhitvaat dukham eva hi tat punah ||***  [[559]] When there is hunger, thirst, and also when there is extreme cold, and when these are removed, one will feel very happy. If we are very thirsty, and we get water to drink, we feel happiness. Similarly, when extreme cold is removed by fire, we feel very comfortable and happy. These are all because of the childish mind, which is not wise, and does not have the proper understanding of the things, because again, it causes grief only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

The answer is that it is wrong understanding that that which causes grief is bringing happiness. This is told in the *shloka 'Kshut sheetaadi*'. Fire which burns and causes grief is thought to be causing happiness, in the presence of cold, and so thought of a means of happiness. When hunger is not there, food itself causes vomiting, indigestion, etc., which makes one suffer, and so they only become causes of grief. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 17, Shloka 61:   
Atyanta stimita angaanaam vyaayaamena sukhaishinaam |   
Bhraanti jnyaana aavrutaakshaanaam \(prahaaro api\) dukhameva

Those whose knowledge is covered with delusion, wrong understanding, *dukha * itself leads to *sukha, vyaayaama * is also *aayaasa * only, but they think that they are seeking more happiness, but it is actually wrong understanding. ***

Dukha hetutvena prasiddheh api dukhaantara upashaamakatva

Though some are well known to cause sorrow, because they are known to destroy some other grief, they are thought to be causes of happiness. This is explained through an example in the *shloka 'atyanta' *.

In hell, all these are seen separate from the body, and one suffers in hell. Even here, it is very much the same state, but because it is covered, it creates a feeling of being joyous, happy. Here, if one enjoys such things, even in hell he should enjoy.  [[561]]

By itself, fire does not cause joy to someone, it burns and causes grief. If there is extreme cold, if fire is brought, it causes a feeling of happiness. Similarly, when one has taken too much water, we cannot give water to such a person; he will just reject it. Whereas when one is very thirsty, that water causes happiness and sometimes it causes grief also. Similarly with food - when one has overeaten, food itself causes grief, and leads to more trouble. Whereas when one is very hungry, it gives a feeling of happiness. Otherwise, if it is  [[562]] not there, if food is not there, when one is hungry, the absence of that causes *dukha*, and the presence of that causes *sukha*. Because it is not definitive whether food causes happiness or grief, it is wrong understanding that it causes happiness or grief alone. It will be told later that there is nothing which is *sukhaatmaka * or *dukhaatmaka*, and the object by itself is not causing *sukha * or *dukha*, but one's experiences or the state is what is causing that. ***

Jaraa youvana janma aadyaa dharmaa dehasya na aatmanah ||*** Don't think that we are children. Because one who is eternal in the body, is the *aatman*. We are all eternal souls. All these attributes of *baalya, **youvana, jaraa*, birth, death, youth, old age, are attributes of the body and not the soul. He is teaching all these so that one should get *virakti*. 



 [[565]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Yat ahah eva virajet iti shrutyaa jhatiti bhagavat jnyaane yatitavyam

You are there in this body, which is now having the state of childhood, and will undergo youth, etc. *Prahlaada * is teaching this so that one should get *virakti * immediately. Immediately, one should start putting efforts to attain *Bhagavaan*. There should be no delay. 



*Yat ahah eve virajet, tat ahah eva pravrajet*, is *Shruti*. The moment *virakti * comes, the same moment, one should leave everything and go. If you delay even for a minute, you may get some other attachment, and you may not attempt escape from *samsaara * at all. 



*Prahlaada * is teaching these wonderful teachings here, to the children, and to everyone. We will continue these in the next session. Finally, he gives the summary about what one should do. 





***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying how *Amsha * 1, Chapter 18, *Prahlaada Charitram. Hiranyakashipu * is trying to torture *Prahlaada * in many ways, trying to get rid of him. He is not able to do anything as *Prahlaada * is totally immersed in the meditation of *Sri Hari, Mahaa **Vishnu * and nothing can touch him. *Hiranyakashipu * says 'Feed him with food mixed with deadly poison', and *Prahlaada * simply eats it chanting the name of *Govinda*; he just digests everything and nothing happens to him. At that time, *Hiranyakashipu * calls the *purohitaas * again. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 18, Shloka 9:   
Hiranyakashipuh -   
Tvaryataam tvaryataam sadyo he he daitya purohitaah |   


Krutyaam tasya vinaashaaya hi utpaadayata maa chiram ||*** Now, *Hiranyakashipu * calls the *purohitaas * and tells them to come quickly and hurry up, do the *abhichaara kriyaa*, and then create that ferocious being, which will destroy enemies. Don't delay anymore. *** *** [[566]] *

***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying that *Hiranyakashipu * asked *Shambaraasura * to use all his *maaya shakti * to destroy *Prahlaada*. And then, *Bhagavaan's Sudarshana Chakra * comes to *Prahlaada's * rescue, and all the *maayas * of *Shambaraasura * are destroyed one by one. Even *Vaayu * cannot do anything. *Prahlaada * is then taken back to the *aachaarya's gurukula; Shukraachaarya * has written the *Raaja Neeti*, which *Prahlaada * studies; everyday, the *aachaaryas * teach the *Raaja Neeti*. Having learnt all these things, the *aachaaryas * bring *Prahlaada * back to *Hiranyakashipu*, and tell him so - ***

Natural allies are mother's brother's children, etc. All those who are in this world, who are not included among enemies, are *praakruta mitraas*. If a king has donated a lot of money to someone, he will be friendly with them, and they are friendly because of the donation received; those who are honoured will also have a friendly feeling, are artificial friends. Enemies are also of three kinds - natural are those who are waiting to snatch a part which is inherited, *praakruta * are those enemies existing in this world, artificial enemies are those to whom we have done something bad, wrong or *apakaara*. King should be aware of these three kinds of enemies. Those who are unconcerned, the *madhyasthaas * are also of three types. Three  [[585]] worlds are explained as *mitra, ari * and *madhyastha *- those who are friendly, those who are enemies, and those who are not concerned \(neither enemies nor friends\). There is a *paatha trishu kaaleshu * instead of *trishu lokeshu*. Three times means, when there is lot of prosperity, when there is lot of famine, and when things are normal. How should a king be working in these three times? This is said to be of seven kinds, as told in *Manu Smruti*. A king should be having seven attributes or qualities, the qualities of *Indra, Surya, **Vaayu, Yama, Varuna, Chandra * and *Pruthivi. Indra * causes rains for four months during the rainy season; a king showers benefits similarly on his kingdom - this is called *varshana*. Sun, Surya draws up the water, and similarly a king collects taxes - this is *aadaana*. A king enters his enemies armies through spies and other means, just as *Vaayu * enters into beings and conquers them, this is *anupravesha. Yama * is an impartial judge, just like this, the king also rules over the kingdom maintaining justice, punishes the wicked and protects the virtuous ones, this is *maadhyasthya. **Varuna * punishes sinners with *Varuna paasha*, a king also punishes the wicked, *Varuna * surrounds all around, and in a similar way a king protects all round, this is *poornatva*. Moon is pleasant to the whole world, and similarly a king causes happiness and joy to all the citizens, this is *priyatva. Pruthivi*, earth is known for forbearance, *kshamaa * is the name of earth itself, a king should also have this quality, this is *sahishnutva*. The various things that a king should do, and how he should rule over a kingdom, are told. ***

Durgaadhyaksha * is in control of forts and forests. There is a *paatha pootah purodhaah*, those who conduct *yajnyaas * and *yaagaas. Baahyaas * are *amaatyaas. Aabhyantaraas * are those who are in charge of harem \( *antahpura*\), kitchen. *Shankitaas* are those whom the king is always doubting, those who have been won over, and become servants, or those who have done some crime - a king should be very careful about such people because they will always be working against the king. Others \( *itareshu*\) are those who want to do good to the king, who are favourable to him; those who join the king's administration will be tested for their adherence to *dharma, artha *\(money - can they be lured by offering bribe\), *kaama*, fear; and those who have passed all these tests, they are also included in *itareshu*.

A king has to be very careful about such people - they are one who has not got his salaries, one who is greedy, one who is too much egoistic, one who has been disrespected, one who is very angry and does not have control over his anger, one who is very scared - these come under the category of *bhedyaas. Durga * is of five types - mountains, forests, deserts, forts surrounding, water. *Aatavikaas * are those who live in the forests - how to control and bring them under the king's rule. *Kantakaas * are thieves, and enemies who are lowly, roaming around in the forests waiting for a chance to turn against the king - how to control and win over them.

There are fourteen *Vidyaa Sthaanaas * told, those which are not included in these will become *avidyaa*. One has to put effort to learn the *aatma vidyaa shaastra*, which is nothing but *Vedaanta*; they cause the utmost good. *Aatma vidyaa * is *parama mangala*. One has to put effort to acquire knowledge about the *aatman*. Other things are all said to be *avidyaa*. * **Angaani vedaah chatvaarah meemaamsa nyaaya vistarah | **Puraanam dharma shaastram cha vidyaah hi etaah chaturdashaah ||* Fourteen *Vidyaa Sthaanaas * are told - four *Vedaas*, six *Angaas *\( *Shikshaa **Vyaakaranam Chandah Niruktam Jyotisham Kalpa*\), *Poorva **Meemaamsa * and *Uttara Meemaamsa, Nyaaya shaastra, Puraanaas, Dharma **Shaastra*. 



*Puraanaas * explain the meanings of *Vedaanga*. *Dharma shaastraas * explain meanings of the *Poorva Kaanda * of *Vedaas, yajnyaas*, etc. *Artha shaastra * and others are not included in this. ***

Tat karma yat na bandhaaya saa vidyaa yaa vimuktaye |   
Aayaasaaya aparam karma vidyaa anyaa shilpa naipunam || ***What are the *karmaas * which one should do, and what *vidyaa * one should learn? One should do those acts which will not bind one to *samsaara*, which does not lead one to bondage; all other things are not *karma*, one should not even do those acts. That which will lead one to liberation, can only be told as *vidyaa*; all others are *avidyaa * only. All other *karmaas * that one does, is all simply exhaustion only, nothing else; it is of no use. All other *vidyaas * are also getting expertise in useless things. 



What is the knowledge which one should acquire? That knowledge which will lead one to liberation. 



What are the acts that one should do? Those which will not bind one. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

They are only means to attain *alpa asthira phalaas*; they are simply getting expertise in some actions which are of no use. That which does not bind one, but being an accessory of *vidyaa*, leads to *moksha*, liberation; that only is *karma*. The remaining karma becomes *pravrutti karma*, in order to gain worldly benefits. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 42:   
Tat etat avagamya aham asaaram saaram uttamam |

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 43:   
Na chintayati ko raajyam ko dhanam na abhivaancchati |   
Tathaa api bhaavyam eva etat ubhayam praapyate naraih || ***Who does not think of ruling over a kingdom, who does not desire to acquire wealth? Whether you desire to become a king or emperor, or you want to acquire lot of money and wealth; if you have done some *karmaas * in your earlier life, if you are destined to get that, only then you will get; otherwise you will never get. One will only get whatever one is destined to get. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Na iti | Bhaavyam praak karmato bhaavi | Ubhayam raajyam dhanam

Sarva eva mahaabhaaga mahatvam prati sodyamaah |   
Tathaapi pumsaam bhaagyaani na udyamaah bhooti hetavah ||*** Everyone puts a lot of effort to attain greatness, to acquire a lot of wealth. Even then, just putting mere effort will not lead one to acquire wealth, but if they are destined to get, that fate only will decide.

Sarva eva iti | Mahatvam aishvaryam | *** [[593]]

Jadanaam avivekaanaam ashooraanaam api prabho |   
Bhaagya bhojyaani raajyaani santi aneetimataam api || ***It can be seen that those who are dullards, those who are ignorant, those who have no valour, they also acquire a lot of good things, they also get a kingdom, they enjoy lot of wealth, even those not on the right path. 



Just by putting effort one cannot be assured. Previous *karmaas * decide the fate.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 46:   
Tasmaat yateta punyeshu ya icchet mahateem shriyam |   
Yatitavyam samatve cha nirvaanam api cha icchataa || ***One has to do virtuous deeds, if he wants lot of wealth and other things of greatness. One who desires liberation, he should put effort to acquire *samatvam*. 



*Samatvam yoga uchyate * is told in *Bhagavad Geetha*. In the *Geetha **Bhaashya * it was told as *aatma aatma saamya, aatma Paramaatma saamya*. Everyone is *sama * because *Bhagavaan * is *aatma * to everyone. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tasmaat iti | Samatve bhagavat aatmakatvena sarvasya samatva   
buddhou | ***All are equal or similar because all are having *Paramaatman * as their inner controller, inner self. There is nothing which is not *bhagavat aatmaka*. Developing such an equanimity of mind, will lead to liberation. 





Here, *Prahlaada * says the most essential teaching. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 47:   
Devaah manushyaah pashavah pakshi vruksha sareesrupaah |   
Roopam etat anantasya vishnoh bhinnam iva sthitam ||*** We are seeing all these things here, *devaas, manushyaas, pashus*, birds, trees, serpents - all these are forms of *Vishnu*, as though they are present as separated.  [[594]] 



These are all forms of Vishnu only. But they are seen as separated. We see a tree separately, an animal separately, a man separately, etc. as though present distinctly. But, they are all *Ananta's roopa* only, *Vishnu's * forms. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Devaa iti | Bhinnam iva tatah pruthak bhootam iva | Ananta iva tat tat   
roopena sthita iti jnyaapanam eva samyak \* neha naanaasti kinchana \*   
na tat asti vinaa \* iti cha |*** *Vishnu * is only present in all these forms, this is what is the right understanding. *Shruti * says - there is no multiplicity. It is not that there is *bhagavat aatmaka * and there is *abhagavat aatmaka*; everything is *bhagavat aatmaka*. Everything is having only *Paramaatman * as the *aatman*. Krishna says ' *Na tat asti vinaa yat syaat mayaa bhootam charaacharam*' - movables and immovables which are not having Me as the inner self, does not exist. Everything is *bhagavat aatmaka * only. All these forms, though seen as separate, are all forms of Vishnu only, who is all pervasive, and existing as inner controller of everything. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 48:   
Etat vijaanataa sarvam jagat sthaavara jangamam |   
Drashtavayam aatmavat vishnuh yato ayam vishvaroopadhruk || ***One who has realized this, all this world consisting of immovables and movables, Vishnu only is existing everywhere. This *Vishnu*, is the only One who is having all forms in this entire world we see. He is the *Vishva roopa*. 



Just like He is inner controller of me, He is inner controller of everything else. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Etat iti | Aatmavat antaryaaminaa paramaatmanaa yuktam | Matup

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 49:   
Evam jnyaate sa bhagavaan anaadih parameshvarah |   
Praseedati achyutah tasmin prasanne klesha samkshayah || *** [[595]] If one realizes this, *Bhagavaan * who is *anaadi*, does not have a beginning, the Supreme Lord, *Parameshvara; Achyuta * will be very pleased and graces such a person who realizes this. If *Bhagavaan * is pleased and graces such a one, all his difficulties will get destroyed. 



This is what *Prahlaada * tells *Hiranyakashipu*, that this is the truth and essential knowledge that one should acquire. That is why he sees that what he has learnt in the *raaja neeti, artha shaastra * is not the right knowledge, and it is *avidyaa*. He tells what is *vidyaa*, the *uttama saara * that one has to acquire and realize. 



Again, *Hiranyakashipu * gets very angry, and does some more bad things to *Prahlaada*, which we will see next.

He viprachitte he raaho he balaisha mahaarnave |

Bahusho vaarito asmaabhih ayam paapah tathaa api areh |

Tata iti | Salila arnave arnava salile |*** The word *salila-arnave * means *arnava salile *- waters of the ocean.

Bhoolokam akhilam drushtvaa plaavyamaanam mahaa ambhasaa |

Na agnih dahati na eva ayam shastraih cchinno na cha uragaih |   
Kshayam neeto na vaatena na vishena na krutyayaa ||***  [[597]] Fire does not burn him, he was not harmed by weapons, the serpents did not do any harm to him, neither *vaayu * nor poison could kill him. And even by *Krutya * he could not be harmed. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 60:   
Na maayaabhih na cha eva ucchaat paatito na cha diggajaih |   
Baalo ati dushta chitto ayam na anena arthoi asti jeevataa ||*** Even *Shambaraasura's maayaas * could not harm him and falling from the big mountain also he was unharmed. Even *Diggajas * could not kill him. This boy is very wicked and there is no meaning in his living.

In all these, there is an *antaryaami*, who is very subtle. All these, and also the various elements, are also created from whom, and established in whom. 



Earlier it is told as *vishvam*, this is a short form, *sankshepa*, in one word. This is expanded in detail as *roopaani sookshmaani, bhoota bhedaah*. Told as *vishvam * is also You only, and told as various elements is also You only. You are *antaryaami * of all that. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 75:   
Tasmaat cha sookshmaadi visheshanaanaam agochare yat paramaatma   
roopam | *** [[602]] ***Kim api achintyam tava roopam asti tasmai namaste purushottamaaya   
||*** What is seen outside is Your *divya mangala vigraha*, and what is superior to that is Your essential nature, *divya aatma svaroopa*. That which is subtle than all these various manifest forms. It cannot be seen by anyone. That form of yours is unimaginable, and one cannot say that it is like this. To that form, I pay obeisance, O *Purushottama*. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Divya aatma svaroopam aaha tasmaat iti | Tasmaat param iti sheshah   
| Paramaartha roopam parama prayojana roopam | Yat paramaatma   
roopam iti cha paathah | Roopam svaroopam |*** After having told about His wonderful form, His essential nature, *svaroopa * is told. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 76:   
Sarva bhooteshu sarvaatman yaa shaktih aparaa tava |   
Gunaashrayaa namah tasyai shaashvataayai sureshvara ||*** Having told that *Bhagavaan * is only present as *avyakta, mahat, ahamkaara*, the various elements, etc., and also the *divya aatma svaroopa, Prahlaada * is eulogizing Him as present as inner controller of the bound selves, and the liberated selves. The *muktaatma svaroopa * is told as His *paraa shakti*, and *baddha aatma * is told as *aparaa shakti*. In all the beings, embodied selves, O controller of all, that which is abode to all the *trigunaas, sattva, **rajas, tamas*, to that form of Yours, I pay obeisance to. 



In the *shaastraas*, the word *bhoota * is used to denote an embodied self. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Kshetrajnya roopam mukta roopam cha aaha sarva bhooteshu iti   
dvaabhyaam | Sarva bhooteshu iti | Gunaah sattvaadayah aashrayo   
yasyaah saa gunaashrayaa; aparaa mukta apekshayaa nikrushtaa | ***You are present as inner controller of bound and liberated selves. Compared to the liberated selves, the *baddhaas * are inferior, therefore they are called as *aparaa*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 77:   
Yaa ateeta gocharaa vaachaam manasaam cha avisheshanaa |   
Jnyaani jnyaana paricchedyaa taam vande cha aishvareem paraam || ***Which cannot be imagined by anyone, cannot be seen by anyone, through words and mind, that which cannot be explained in words, and which cannot  [[603]] be thought in mind, very superior, it can only be known through knowledge of *jnyaanis*, I bow down. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

eeshvaraam paraam iti cha paathah | ***The *mukta svaroopa * is also told as *eeshvareem paraam*, One which is independent; everything is *paratantra*, and *Bhagavaan * only is *svatantra*, and how can *mukta svaroopa * be told as *eeshvareem*, this is explained here; when the bound self gets liberated, getting rid of its *karma **bandha*, *Shruti * says that he gets *karma svaatantrya*, he gets freed from the bondage of *karma*, that is why he is told as *svatantra, svaraat*. There is a *shloka * which comes later, which says His *paraa shakti, aparaa shakti; **shakti * also has a meaning of *shareera*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 78:   
Om namo vaasudevaaya tasmai bhagavate sadaa |   
Vyatiriktam na yaasyaasti vyatirikto akhilasya yah ||*** I always pay obeisance to that *Vaasudeva, Bhagavaan*; everything is *bhagavat aatmaka*, there is nothing which is separated from *Bhagavaan*, He is present as inner controller and inner self of everything. *Prahlaada * prays to *Vishnu * with the *Dvaadashaakshara mantra*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Om nama iti | Om ityaadi mantrasya arthah triteeya shashtayoh

He is different from everything, He is the cause and the world is the effect; in this way, He is different from the world which is the effect. The *Purusha **Sookta mantraas * are told here - He is superior to the world, ten thousandth part of a ten thousandth part is this world \( *ayuta* means ten thousand\), everything is controlled through His *sankalpa * itself. He stays in everything as *antaryaami*, and is different and distinct. 



*Sarvatra asou vasati samastam cha atra vasati*, everything lives in Him, and He lives in everything, and He is different and distinct from everything, He  [[604]] is untouched by the defects of all these, and everything is inseparably associated with Him, and He is inner controller. He is the supporter. Everything is meant for His use, and He is the master who enjoys everything. He is the ultimate enjoyer and bestower of all fruits. Everything is also present in such a way that nothing is present independent of Him. Everything is dependent on Him. There is nothing which is not *brahmaatmaka*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 79:   
Namah tasmai namah tasmai namah tasmai mahaatmane |   
Naama roopam na yasya asti yo astitvena na upalabhyate || ***I do *namaskaara * to Him, that *mahaatman*. He does not have name and form, He is there and present all the time. He cannot be told as only this form or this name. He is present in all names and in all forms, in any *prakaara*. 



*Apakshaya vinaashaabhyaam parinaamarddhi janmatah varjitah shakyate **vaktum yah sadaa asti iti kevalam*, will come later. The *shat bhaava **vikaaraas * present for everyone, *asti *\(is present\), *jaayate *\(gets born\), *vardhate *\(grows\), *viparinamate *\(gets modified\), *apaksheeyate *\(deteriorates\), *nashyati *\(gets destroyed\); *Bhagavaan * does not have any of these. If these *shat bhaava **vikaaraas * are not there, how can anyone tell Him in any way? It is possible to tell, He is always present; that is the only way in which He can be told. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Namah iti | Aadaraat namaskaara aavruttih; sankarshana aadi vyooha   
vishayaa vaa | Naama roopam na yasya jeevavat na karma krutam | ***The repetition shows *aadara*, great respect. Again and again he is doing *namaskaara*. Or, it can also be interpreted as *Sankarshana, **Pradyumna * and *Aniruddha*, as told three times.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 80:   
Yasya avataara roopaani samarchanti divoukasah |

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 81:   
Yo antah tishthan asheshasya pashyati eeshah shubha ashubham |   
Tam sarva saakshinam vishnum namaste parameshvaram || *** [[605]] Being present inside everything, directly seeing all the good and bad things that all the beings are doing all the time, that *Parameshvara*, Supreme Lord Vishnu, I do *namaskaara*. 



*Yah pruthivyaam tishthan pruthivyaa antarah yam pruthivi na veda yo **agnou tishthan ya aatmani tishthan ... * 



*Varuno yaati madhye satya anrute avapashyan janaanaam*. He is seeing all the good and bad things that all beings are doing, every moment, He is present inside the heart seeing all these things. Nobody can escape Him. 



*Saakshi * means *saakshaat drashtari sanjnyaayaam*, He is directly seeing everything. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 82:   
Namo astu vishnave tasmai yasya abhinnam idam jagat |   
Dhyeyah sa jagataam aadyah sa praseedatu me avyayah ||*** This world is not different from Him. He is only present in all these forms. All these are His modes. One who is present before this whole world, He is the sole creator, He is the *jagat kaarana*. The cause of this whole world - is to be meditated upon. That immutable one, let Him be pleased with me. 



*Shruti * says *Kaaranam tu dhyeyah* - who is to be meditated upon, *kascha **dhyeyah*, is the question posed, and the answer given is *kaaranam tu **dhyeyah *- the One who is the cause of this universe - is to be meditated upon. Because if one has to escape from this world, one has to take refuge in the Creator only. Only the Creator can make someone get out of this creation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Namo astu iti | Yasya abhinnam kaaryatvaad roopavatvaat cha |*** World is not different from HIM due to being effect and having a form.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 83:   
Yatrotam etat protam cha vishvam akshara samjyake |   
Aadhaara bhootah sarvasya sa praseedatu me harih || ***Everything is woven like the warp and weft in a cloth, the cross-wise and length-wise threads, the way they are woven, in this way, everything is woven in Him. He is called *akshara*, He is the support of everything. Let Him be pleased with me. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: *** [[606]] ***Yatra iti | Yatra etat vishvam otam kunda iva, protam sootre   
maniganaa iva \* brahman sa vishvaa bhootaani naaveeva antah   
samaahitaah \* sootre maniganaa iva iti cha |*** Everything is interwoven like the warp and weft in a cloth; it is told in the *Geetha * that *sootre maniganaa iva*. In the *Shruti, Taittiriya Braahmana*, it is told that the whole world is placed in *Bhagavaan*. There is a nice example as to how it is placed, when someone travels by ship or boat, everything, people and things are loaded onto that, and place inside. Just like this, the sentients and non-sentients are placed in *Bhagavaan*. 



When crossing over the ocean, all the *chetana * and *achetana*, people and things, are kept inside the ship. In the same way, the whole world of sentients and insentients are all placed in *Paramaatman*, it is said. 





The next *shloka * is a wonderful *shloka * quoted by our *aachaaryaas*, and it shows *Prahlaada's * way of meditation. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 84:   
Om namo vishnave tasmai namah tasmai punah punah |   
Yatra sarvam yatah sarvam yah sarvam sarva samshrayah || ****Prahlaada * prays to Vishnu with the *Vishnu Shadakshara mantra*, again and again I pay obeisance to Him. Everything is established in whom, and everything is created from whom, one who is everything, He is the abode of everything. To Him, I pay obeisance. 





***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying *Prahlaada Charitam*, about how *Prahlaada * started to worship, meditate upon *Paramaatman * during the *aaraadhana kaala*, inside the ocean when he was completely covered with huge boulders. He started to pray to *Bhagavaan * sensing that the time of *aaraadhana * has come. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 83:   
Yatrotam etat protam cha vishvam akshara samjyake |   
Aadhaara bhootah sarvasya sa praseedatu me harih || ***Just as this whole world is woven in Him, like the warp and weft threads of a cloth, widthwise and lengthwise threads in a loom, all the entities in this world are residing in *Paramaatman*. He is known as *akshara*. He is the support of everything; that *Hari*, let Him be pleased with me. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Yatra iti | Yatra etat vishvam otam kunda iva, protam sootre

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 84:   
Om namo vishnave tasmai namah tasmai punah punah |   
Yatra sarvam yatah sarvam yah sarvam sarva samshrayah || ***I bow down to that *Vishnu*. Again and again, I prostrate unto Him. Everything is existing in Him, everything is created from Him only, He is only everything. Everything emanates from Him, He only creates everything. He is only present in all these forms, being the *antaryaami*. He is the refuge for everything. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Om iti | Yatra sarvam sthitam leenam iti vaa, yatah sarvam   
upaadaanabhootaat bhavati, ata eva yah sarvam |*** During *pralaya*, everything goes and merges unto Him. He is the material cause of everything, everything is created from Him. He is the sole cause, He is the material cause. Because He is the material cause, everything is Him only. 





This is the wonderful experience of *Prahlaada * that we see here. What is told in the *Upanishads* as *Ahamgrahopaasana*, he experiences that. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 85:   
Sarva gatvaat anantasya sa eva aham avasthitah |   
Mattah sarvam aham sarvam mayi sarvam sanaatane || ***One who is present in everything as the inner self, He is *Ananta*. I am also present as Him only. Everything is created from Me only. I am only everything. Everything is existing in Me. 



*Shruti * says *Satyam jnyaanam anantam brahma*. He has *desha kaala vastu **pariccheda raahitya*; He is present in all objects at all times, in all places. There is no place where He is not there. There is no object in which He is not there. There is no time in which He is not there. He is all pervading. 



This is *Ahamgrahopaasana*, as *Nammaazhvaar * also says. *Rishi **Vaamadeva * also experiences this, as told in the *Upanishads. **Prahlaada* experiences *Vishnu * in himself. This is an ' *Aham Brahmaasmi*' kind of experience. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Sarva gatvaat iti | Sarvatah sarvatra aatmatvena yo vasati | Anaadi   
madhya antam ityaadi visheshanaih rachitah jadaat yo vyaavruttah   
sacchidaananda svaroopah sa eva aham avasthita iti atra anantasya *** [[608]] ***sarva gatatvam hetuh | ****Bhagavaan * does not have beginning, or middle or end. He is present all the time. One who is different and distinct from inert objects, non sentient objects. He is *Sat, Chit, Aananda svaroopa*. He is *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*, always present. He is present in me, *brahmaatmakatvena*, He is inner self of me also. How he is experiencing this is because *Ananta * is all pervading, present everywhere. *Prahlaada * is experiencing the all pervasiveness of *Paramaatman*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 86:   
Aham eva akshayo nityah paramaatmaa aatma samshrayah |   
Brahma samjyo aham eva agre tathaa ante cha parah pumaan || ***Everything is taking refuge in Him. He is refuge for everything. He does not have any other support. He is present in Himself. He Himself is support for Himself. Before *srushti * also, I am *Brahmaatmaka*, after *pralaya * also. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Aham eva iti | Sa paramaatmaa kim aashraya iti atra aaha - aatma   
samshraya iti | Na kinchit aashritah, sve mahimni pratishtitah | Nanu   
brahmano jagat utpattih shrooyate \* yato vaa imaani \* ityaadinaa; tat   
katham matta iti uchyate | Tatra aaha brahma samjnyo aham iti |   
Brahma aatmakatvaat aham eva brahma samjyah | Agre srushteh praak   
| Ante pralaye |*** He is not depending on anything. He is the support of Himself. He exists by Himself. The *Upanishad * says ' *Yato vaa imaani bhootaani jaayante, yena **jaataani jeevanti*' - from Whom this whole world is created, all these beings are created, and all these live because of Whom; sustenance and everything is from *Paramaatman * only. How can *Prahlaada * say that 'Everything is created from me' when the *Upanishad * says that everything is created from *Brahman*? Everything is created from *Brahman*. The answer is that 'I am called as *Brahma*', this is *Brahmaatmakatva*. Because I have *Brahman * as my *aatman*, I myself can be called as *Brahma. Prahlaada * is experiencing *Paramaatman* as the *antaryaami*, and he is doing that *anusandhaana*. Everywhere *Paramaatman * is present as the inner self, and when one starts to meditate upon the *Brahmaatmakatva * of *Paramaatman*, they themselves will think as *Brahma*. This is the kind of experience called *Ahamgrahopaasana*. This is what *Prahlaada * experienced here. 



With this, Chapter Nineteen comes to an end.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 1:   
Sri Paraasharah -   
Evam sanchintayan vishnum abhedena aatmano dvija |   
Tanmayatvam avaapa agryam mene cha aatmaanam achyutam ||*** *Sri Paraashara *- O *Maitreya*, this is what happened to *Prahlaada*. Meditating thus upon *Vishnu*, thinking of himself as *Vishnu*, experiencing the *Vishnu * who is *antaryaami * in him, he experienced that he merged himself into *Vishnu*, he reached the perfection of that experience, and because of that he thought of himself as *Achyuta*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Vishada vishadatara vishadatama kramena yoga kaashtaam praapta iti   
aaha evam iti | Aatmano abhedena sva shareerakatvena | Vishnu

praachuryam | Agryam utkrushtam, svasya tat aatmakatva   
vaishadyaam api | Ata eva aatmaanam achyutam mene | Tanmayatvam   
avaapyaage iti cha paathah | ***How *Prahlaada * reached that pinnacle of *Yoga*, the ultimate state of *Yoga*; first it became clear, then it became more clear, and then he had a vivid perception, when he meditated upon *Paramaatman. Brahman * having him as *Brahman's shareera*; he himself being the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, that is how he experienced. *Vishnu * is the cause. When it is said ' *Sat eva somya **idam agra aaseet, tat aikshata bahusyaam prajaayeya*', 'I will be born, I will become many', then He became everything Himself, this is the effect, *kaarya bhoota*. Everything existed as His mode, being His *shareera*. This is in the *shareera shareeri bhaava * with three relationships - *aadhaara **aadheya bhaava, niyaamaka niyaamya bhaava * and *sheshi shesha bhaava*. Everything is present within *Paramaatman * with these three relationships. The entire world is present as effect, as His mode only, being His *shareera*. Because *Paramaatman * is *antaryaami*, all words denote *Paramaatman * only in  [[610]] the ultimate analysis, so everything can be called as *Vishnu * only. *Sarvam **khalvidam brahma * means *sarvam brahmaatmakam*, everything can be called as *Brahman * in the *aparyavasaana vrutti*. Any name and form is *Paramaatman * only. *Shruti * says clearly - *Prajaapatih prajaa asrujata, taa **srushtaah samashlishyan, saa roopena anupraavishat*, ..., when *Paramaatman * created everything, everything was existing as Him only, united in Him; He did *anupravesha * as form; so they say that all forms as *Paramaatman * only, and He did *anupravesha * in names also; so all names as *Brahman * only. All forms and names are *Brahman*. This means that everything has *Paramaatman * as *antaryaami. Prahlaada * meditated as *kaarana roopa Vishnu * became *kaarya*, he experienced the *Brahmaatmakatva* directly; he had abundance of that experience. Then he thought himself as *Achyuta*, he had vivid perception of *Paramaatman * being *antaryaami*, and he being the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*. In this state, he thought of himself as *Achyuta*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 2:   
Visasmaara tadaa aatmaanam na anyat kinchit ajaanata |   
Aham eva avyayo anantah paramaatmaa iti achintayat ||*** He forgot himself, he did not know anything else, he thought of himself as only the immutable one, I am only *Ananta*, I am only *Paramaatman*. He had this experience. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Visasmaraa iti | Ayoga dashaayaam aatmaanam atadaatmaktvena   
bhraantyaa vaasitam visasmaara | Sva prakaashasya yoga dashaayaam   
aavirbhootasya cha svaroopasya vismarana ayogaat; svaroopa

vachanavat mattah sarvam ityaadi vachanam na syaat | Tarhi katham   
achintayat tatra aaha aham eva avyayah iti |*** Now he is in *yoga dasha*. Earlier he was in *ayoga dasha*. We are all in *ayoga **dasha*; in this *dasha*, we don't experience *Brahman * as *aatman*, the experience that we are all *brahmaatmaka * is not there in the *ayoga dasha*. In the *yoga dasha*, it will be experienced completely. In the *ayoga dasha*, what he thought himself as not *brahmaatmaka*, which is due to wrong knowledge, *bhraanti *- he forgot that. What he was thinking in the *ayoga **dasha*, that he was not *brahmaatmaka*, he forgot that wrong knowledge. The knowledge of *Aham Brahma Asmi * is not *svaroopa aikya*, that *Brahman * only is true and nothing else exists - this is not that kind of knowledge; the knowledge is that I am also true, but am having *Brahman * as  [[611]] the inner self, and I am the *shareera * of *Paramaatman *- this kind of experience. *Visasmaara * means that he forgot the earlier knowledge that he had, that was not not in the *yoga dasha*, the wrong knowledge that he was not *brahmaatmaka*. This is because he had reached the vivid perception of *Paramaatman * as *aatman*. In *yoga dasha*, one experiences the self, as the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, that *Paramaatman * is present as the inner self. In the first stage, he experiences the individual self, and then experiences the individual self as having *Paramaatman * as *aatman*. At that stage, the individual self is *svayam prakaasha*. We are not able to experience this because of our karma, and because our *dharma bhoota **jnyaana * is hindered, covered and contracted. In the *yoga dasha*, one will be able to experience the individual self's *svaroopa*, which is *svayam **prakaasha*. This *svayam prakaasha* cannot disappear at that stage. In *yoga **dasha*, that *svayam prakaasha * will become *aavirbhoota*, it reveals itself directly; this cannot be forgotten. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * quotes *Rishi **Vaamadeva * from *Upanishads*, that 'I am only *Manu*, I only became *Manu*, I am only *Soorya*' - he experiences like this. I and *Paramaatman * are different and distinct, but the relationship is *aatma shareera bhaava*. It is not the experience of I merging into *Paramaatman*, and losing the *svaroopa*; because the *svaroopa * which is *svayam prakaasha * of the individual self, that reveals more vividly at that time. Then the *Paramaatma svaroopa * is also experienced, with the relation. If he had forgotten his *svaroopa * itself, if he had not realized his own self itself at that time, he could not have said ' *Mattah sarvam', 'Aham sarvam'. Prahlaada's svaroopa*, which is *svayam **prakaasha*, is well revealed at that stage. He realized that it was *brahmaatmaka*, the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*. Then he realized that 'I am only immutable, and *Ananta*'. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 3:   
Tasya tat bhaavanaa yogaat ksheena paapasya vai kramaat |   
Shuddhe antahkarane vishnuh tasthou jnyaanamayo achyutah ||*** As he reached the vivid perception of the self, having *Paramaatman * as *aatman*, because of that experience, that state of meditation, all his *paapaas * started to get destroyed, step by step. His mind became very clear, pure, and there *Vishnu * revealed Himself, that *Achyuta **Vishnu*, who is *jnyaanamaya*, He revealed Himself.

The whole ocean was agitated like anything, with waves. The whole world including mountains, forests, was shaken up, when *Prahlaada * moved.

Utkshipya tasmaat salilaat nischakraama mahaa matih || ***At that moment, *Prahlaada * just came out of that ocean, and threw away all the things that he was bound with, the boulders and *naaga paasha*, which were all thrown on him and completely covered him. He just came out of those waters, and threw away all those things. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 7:   
Drushtvaa cha sa jagat bhooyo gaganaadi upalakshanam |   
Prahlaado asmi iti sasmaara punah aatmaanam aatmanaa ||*** When he came out of the ocean, he saw the world, with sky and trees, all around, which he had completely forgotten, as he was having a vivid perception of *Vishnu * in his mind, in *yoga dasha*. As he came out, he saw the sky and other things outside. Then he remembered himself as *Prahlaada*, which he had completely forgotten as he had the experience of the self, *Vishnu * as *aatman*, and he had vivid perception of *Vishnu*. When he came out, at that moment, due to power of *yoga*, he threw away everything, and came outside from the waters.  [[613]] 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Drushtvaa iti | Prahlaado asmi iti loka drushtyaa kevalam oupaadhika   
roopa avacchinnam aatmaanam sasmaara, na tu paramaatma   
roopatayaa | ***From the way it is experienced in the world, the self as he experiences being covered by *karma*, due to *upaadhi*, the worldly view; that was not his experience in the *yoga kaashtha*. 



Now he again remembered that he was *Prahlaada*, being covered by *upaadhi*, and present in this form with this body, etc. 



All the forms of *deva, asura*, etc. are not there for *aatman * in the state without *karma*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 8:   
Tushtaava cha punah dheemaan anaadim purushottamam |   
Ekaagra matih avyagro yatavaak kaaya maanasah ||*** He was such a great devotee, when he came out, the most intelligent knowledgeable person, *jnyaani * he was, one who had the knowledge of the self, *aatma jnyaana*, again he started to pray to *Bhagavaan, Purushottama*. With complete concentration, without any disturbance, with speech, and mind, totally merged in *Paramaatman*. 





*Prahlaada * now prays to *Bhagavaan*, with *Pranava*, just like a *mantra*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 9:   
Prahlaadah -

Here, *sthoola, kshara, vyakta * are grouped together to describe the *kaarya roopa*, in the form of effect, everything is in the gross state with name and form, that which is visible and manifest. *Sookshma, **akshara, avyakta * in the *kaarana roopa*, with *sthoola chit-achit vishishta **Paramaatman*, He is subtle, imperishable and unmanifest; this is the causal state of *Paramaatman. Kalaah * means all the five *indriyaas*, all the five objects of senses, and all the five elements. *Shruti * says that when one gets liberated, having got rid of the bondage of *karma * completely, he attains ultimate similarity with *Paramaatman*, his *jnyaana svaroopa * manifests completely; he exists in his original form where his attributive consciousness is fully evolved, present in its original state. 



*Na ksharati iti aksharam*, that which does not perish.

vibhavah | Asphutam para roopam |*** *Nirguna * is told in the sense that He does not have *sattva, rajas, tamas*, which are the qualities, attributes of *prakruti. Prakruti * is told as *triguna*, having *sattva, rajas * and *tamas * as qualities. Everything which is a modification of *prakruti*, called *praakruta*, it all has these three *gunaas - **mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas, ekaadasha indriyaas*. Qualities of *prakruti, sattva, rajas, tamas * are not there in *Eeshvara*, *Paramaatman. Moorta * is *sthoola prapancha roopa*, and *amoorta * is *sookshma prapancha roopa*. In causal state, this whole world is present in subtle state, and is existing united with *Paramaatman. **Paramaatman * is only present in the subtle state, qualified, *sookshma chit * [[615]] *achit vishishta Paramaatman*, the *kaarana. Sthoola chit achit vishishta **Paramaatman * is the *kaarya*. In the *Vishvaroopa Adhyaaya * of *Bhagavad **Geetha*, this is told wonderfully, where *Arjuna * sees the *Vishvaroopa * of *Paramaatman *- this form of *Paramaatman * is said to be *Mahaa Moorti*. Or also the form of *Vaishvaanara*, which is told in *Upanishads, dyouh moordhaa, soorya * and *chandra * are His eyes; the whole world is imagined as a form of *Paramaatman * itself; this is how they meditate upon in *Vaishvaanara vidyaa*. He is *Vaishvaanara moorti. Sookshma **moorti * is *vyooha roopa, Vyooha Vaasudeva*, which is very subtle; *sphuta **roopa * is *vibhava*, where He comes as *Raama, Krishna*, where He moves around and talks to people. *Asphuta * is the *para roopa*. These are all the attributes of *Paramaatman * by which *Prahlaada * is praising *Paramaatman*.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 11: *****Karaala soumya roopaatman vidyaa avidyaamaya achyuta |***** *****Sat asat roopasadbhaava sat asat bhaava bhaavana ||*** You are with ferocious form, with very pleasant form, *vidyaa, avidyaa, sat, **asat roopa, sat asat bhaava bhaavanaa*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

sat \* iti | Vastoonaam sat asat bhaavou karoti jaanaati iti vaa sat asat   
bhaava bhaavana |*** Ferocious form is when *Paramaatman * is doing *samhaara, pralaya*. By Himself, He is of very pleasant form. *Avidyaa * is *karma*, or also the wrong knowledge. *Vidyaa * is all the *upaasanaas. Asat * means *abhaava roopa*, not that He does not have any form, He has got a very subtle form, and is present as *naastitva vishishta Paramaatman*, which is not perceptible to our *indriyaas. Sat * itself is *Paramaatman*. In *Bhagavad Geetha*, it is told that upon doing *karma*, if we do *Om Tat*, or *Om Sat*, or when we are doing some good *karmaas, Sat * is told. When He creates *sat bhaava * and *asat bhaava * for all the *vastus, asat bhaava * can be taken as impermanent, *sat bhaava * is that which is *nitya*. He does *sankalpa * that some objects may be eternal, like *aatman*. Why is *prakruti * changing form all the time, in *avyakta * form, it is also *nitya*; but in the manifested form, *prakruti, aakaasha, vaayu*, etc. are all *anitya*; they merge during *pralaya*. Why are they like that - it is *Paramaatman's sankalpa * that they should be like that. If He does *sankalpa * that something should be *anitya*, it becomes *anitya*. If He  [[616]] does *sankalpa * that something should be *nitya*, it becomes *nitya*. He is the cause of all these. He knows also, and makes them to be like that. For both reasons, He can be called as *sat asat bhaava bhaavanaa*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 12:   
Nitya anitya prapancha aatman nishprapancha amala aashrita |   
Eka aneka namastubhyam vaasudeva aadi kaarana ||*** *Nitya, anitya*, He is the refuge for everyone, He is without blemishes, cause and effect. I do *namaskaara * to You. You are *Vaasudeva*, existing everywhere, all pervading, You are the primeval cause of this whole world. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Nitya anitya iti | Anityam ghata aadi, tat apekshayaa nityam   
gaganaadi | Nishprapancha prapanchaat nirgata, prapancha utteerne   
iti arthah | Eka aneka kaarana roopena eka, kaarya roopena aneka | *** *Nitya * and *anitya * are both told to be *praakruta * only, but *aakaasha * is said to be *nitya * compared to *ghata. Ghata * is a pot which stays for only very short time, compared to *aakaasha * which stays for a long time. He is beyond the *prapancha*, He is beyond the world. He is *eka * in the *kaarana roopa*, and *aneka * in the *kaarya roopa*. 



*Sat eva somya idam agra aaseet. Ekam eva adiviteeyo*. He is *eka*, present as *sookshma chit achit Paramaatman*, when all these things did not have name and form, everything existing in a very subtle form, where one could not differentiate between sentient and non sentient. *Eka * is the causal form *Paramaatman*. In the form of effect, He is present as many. 





This *stuti * of *Prahlaada * is most wonderful. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 13:

karma saapekshatvaat svato vishama srushteh ahetuh |*** This is how *Prahlaada * concludes his prayers. That which is revealed, and well seen, manifest; and because He is *sookshma*, He is not seen. He is only present as everything means that He has got everything other than Himself as His body, *shareera*. Everything is existing as *shareera * to Him. Though He is having everything as His *shareera*, He is different and distinct from everything else - His *svaroopa * and *svabhaava * is very different. Because He is all pervading, everything is existing in Him, He supports everything, He is the Master, Supreme God, having everything as His *shareera*. He is not *jeevaatman*, He is not *prakruti*, He is not any *praakruta * form, because He is very different and distinct from all these. He is only everything as He is present as *antaryaami * of everything. He is *brahmaatmaka. Avishva **hetu * means that He is not the cause of the world - He only creates, it is told; but the various forms that are created, one person becomes human, one becomes *deva*, one becomes *pashu, pakshi, sareesrupa*, all these are driven by the *karma * of those individual beings; He is not the cause of each individual getting different forms and lives, but their own *karma * is the cause of all that; in this sense, He is not the cause of this variety, *vishama **srushti * which we see here. Though He is the creator, He is just doing the act of creation, but the various bodies that the individual selves take is due to their own karma. 



This is the wonderful *Prahlaada Stuti * comes to an end here. Then *Paramaatman * appears before *Prahlaada * and the dialog between *Paramaatman * and *Prahlaada * comes next. 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we started to do *anusandhaana * of *Prahlaada **Stuti*, where *Prahlaada * is meditating on *Paramaatman*, and starts to eulogize *Paramaatman*,

*Prahlaada* eulogizes *Paramaatman* wonderfully, where he tells all the wonderful characteristics of *Paramaatman's svaroopa, svabhaava*. He says all contrasting things, everything is *Paramaatman * only - *sthoola, sookshma, **prakata, aprakaasha*, etc. *Sarva bhootah * means *svetara sarva vastu **shareerah*, having everything other than Himself as His *shareera. Na cha **sarva bhootah * means *svetara samasta vastu vilakshanah*, He is different and distinct from everything other than Himself. The whole world is created from Him. At the same time, He is not the cause of the world, meaning that in this *vishama srushti*, the *vaishamya * is due to the *karma * of the beings who are being born here. *Bhagavaan * is not responsible for this *vaishamya*, the differences seen. We had seen all this in the previous session.

Some of these great persons, according to the good deeds done, they are called *adhikaaris*.

Once that is over, their time is over. *Yaavat adhikaaram **avasthitih aadhikaarikaanaam*, is a *Brahma Sutra*. As long as they have that *adhikaara*, they will be here. *Vasistha*, and others, they come here as per the command of *Bhagavaan*, that they have to do some good things.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 30:   
Vinaasham kurvatah tasya chaturddhaivam mahaatmanah |   
Vibhaaga kalpanaa brahman kathyate sarvakaalikeem ||*** Destruction or dissolution is happening all the time. And there is a *praakruta **pralaya * also at some point. In one form, He is present as *Rudra * who does *samhaara*, second form is *Agni * and *Yama*, third form is *kaala*, and fourth form is all the beings. This kind of division is happening in every *kalpa*. In every *kalpa*, there are *Manvantaraas; Chaturmukha **Brahma * does the creation, *prajaapatis * are created, and all beings are in some way or other part of creation, sustenance and dissolution - these are happening in every *kalpa*. 



The gist is that during creation, sustenance or dissolution, *Vishnu * only is present in various forms. When we say that *Chaturmukha Brahma * did the creation, *Manu * did the sustenance, or that *Kaala * is responsible for all these, and that the beings are responsible in some way for all these things, all of these are actually happening by *Vishnu * only, being present in these forms as the Inner Controller, *antaryaami*.

They are the cause of creation of this world. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 32:   
Vishnuh manu aadayah kaalah sarva bhootaani cha dvija |   
Sthiteh nimitta bhootasya vishnoh etaah vibhootayah ||*** In the same way, for sustenance, *Vishnu * is responsible, *Manu * and others are also responsible, *kaala*, and all the beings are responsible. They are all the *amshaas * of *Bhagavaan * only. They are all the *vibhootis * of *Vishnu. **Haris * present as Inner Controller, *antaryaami * of all these, and He only gets all these done through them; they are responsible to do that, but the ultimate controller is *Bhagavaan * only. 



He is present in *Brahma, Vishnu * and *Maheshvara * and as *Vishnu * Himself. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 33:   
Rudrah kaala antakaadyaah cha samastaah cha eva jantavah |   
Chaturdhaa pralayaaya etaa janaardhana vibhootayah ||*** For *pralaya*, dissolution, *Rudra, kaala, Yama * and *Agni*, and all the beings, are the four parts. These are the *vibhootis * of *Bhagavaan * only, who are established in dissolution or destruction.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 34:   
Jagat aadou tathaa madhye srushtih aapralayaat dvija |   
Dhaatraa mareechih mishraih cha kriyate jantubhih tathaa ||*** At the beginning of the world, in the middle also, up to *pralaya*, creation is going on happening. This is happening by *Chaturmukha Brahma*, *Mareechi*, and the *Prajaapatis*, and also by all the beings. 



After *praakruta pralaya*, when creation happens, when the world is created newly, and from there, creation keeps on happening every *kalpa*, every *manvantara*, and is going on happening all the time. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 35:   
Brahmaa srujati aadikaale mareechi pramukhaah tatah |   
Utpaadayanti apatyaani jantavah cha pratikshanam || *** [[642]] At the very beginning of the *kalpa, Chaturmukha Brahma * does creation. After that, *Mareechi * and *prajaapatis * are established in creation. They create children. And the beings are creating every minute, every second. Every second someone is born. 



At the beginning of the *praakruta pralaya, Chaturmukha Brahma * is created. Every *kalpa * is like a day for *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 36:   
Kaalena na vinaa brahmaa srushti nishpaadako dvija |   
Na prajaapatayah sarve na cha eva akhila jantavah ||*** *Kaala* is an important aspect of creation. Without *kaala's * help, either *Chaturmukha Brahma * or *Prajaapati * or all the beings - nobody can do creation. It all has to happen at a particular time. Time controls how long one stays, lives. At the end of their time, which is specified based on their karma, they have to die. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 37:   
Evam eva vibhaago ayam sthitou api upadishyate |   
Chaturdhaa tasya devasya maitreya pralaye tathaa ||*** In the same way, the divisions are all happening for sustenance also. In the same way, in four forms, *Rudra, Agni/Yama, Kaala*, and all the beings, dissolution is also happening all the time. 



Four broad divisions are told. *Chaturmukha Brahma * is the first to start creation. *Prajaapatis * play a vital role in creation; they have a lot of powers and capability. *Kaala * is an important part for everyone. And, all the beings are also there. In the same way, sustenance is happening by *Vishnu, **Manu * and others, *Kaala * and also all the beings. Destruction is happening by *Rudra, Agni/Yama, Kaala * and then all the beings. These are all *vibhootis * of *Vishnu*, the glory, *shareera * of *Vishnu*. Through them, *Vishnu * only is getting all these done. 





Having told that everything is *Bhagavaan's vibhooti*, now a very generic statement is told by *Paraasharar*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 38: *** [[643]] ***Yat kinchit srujyate yena sattva jaatena vai dvija |   
Tasya srujyasya sambhootou tat sarvam vai hareh tanuh ||*** Whatever is created by whoever, that act of creation, and the thing that is created, everything is *Paramaatman's tanu, shareera*. 



This is one of the main *pramaanaas * for the *Shareera Shareeri bhaava*. This is quoted by *Bhaashyakaarar * and other *Aachaaryaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Etat uktam bhavati iti aaha - yat kinchit iti | Sambhootou iti nimitta   
saptami | Kaarya utpatti nimittam hi kaarana adhishtaanena hareh tat   
tat tanutvam |*** Here, *Sri Engal Aalwaan * also tells like *Bhaashyakaarar *- Having told a lot of things, things are told in summary. Everything is *Hari's * body, is told. How everything becomes His *shareera*, is because *Bhagavaan * is *antaryaami * of the *kaarana*, cause also. *Bhagavaan * is Inner Self, locus, Inner Controller of every cause. He gets creation done through those people being their *antaryaami*. For the sake of creating the effect, He is present as the locus, the cause. Because *Hari * is present as *antaryaami * of everything, everything becomes His *shareera, tanu*. 



*Etat uktam bhavati *- is a typical style of *Bhaashyakaarar*, in *Sri Bhaashya*. Whatever is summarized is expanded sometimes, or, whatever is told in great detail is summarized briefly. *Vistrutasya sangrahah. Sangraheetasya **vistaarah. * 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 39:   
Hanti yaavat cha yat kinchit sattvam sthaavara jangamam |   
Janaardanasya tat roudram maitreya antakaram vapuh ||*** Whoever destroys or kills anything, whether movable or immovable, that *roudra * form of whatever is responsible for destruction, whether it is *Rudra, Agni/Yama*, or a particular being, it is the *roudra **roopa * of *Hari * only. *Bhagavaan * only is *antaryaami * of everything, so everything is said to be His *shareera, tanu, vapu*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 40: *** [[644]] ***Evam esha jagat srushtaa jagat paataa tathaa jagat |   
Jagat bhakshayitaa devah samastasya janaardanah || ***In this way, *Janaardana * is the creator of everything, He is the protector, He is responsible for dissolution, He eats everything, He keeps everything in Himself and protects it as a part of Him, inseparably associated with Him. He is none other than *Janaardana*. 



*Aazhvaar * very clearly says that He swallows and He again throws it out. This symbolically tells that He withdraws everything unto Himself, protects during *pralaya*, and again He creates. Everything is present in subtle form during *pralaya*, and comes to gross state during creation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Evam iti | Samastasya devo janaardanah iti anvayah |*** 





Now, *Paraasharar * starts to tell about *mukta svaroopa*. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 41:   
Srushti sthiti antakaaleshu tridhaa evam sampravartate |   
Gunapravruttyaa paramam padam tasyaagunam mahat ||*** *Srushti, sthiti * and *anta *- it is happening in these three ways. In each of these, there are four forms. Through *sattva, rajas * and *tamas*. When *sattva * is high, He is responsible for sustenance. When *rajas * is high, creation happens. When *tamas * is high, destruction or dissolution happens. Due to the effects of the various *gunaas*, creation, sustenance and destruction happen. Everything is His *shareera, vibhooti*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Triguna vashyam roopam nigamayati srushti sthiti iti aarabhya guna   
pravrutti iti antena | Srushti iti | Srushti aadi kaaleshu guna   
pravruttyaa tridhaa bhootah, evam ukta prakaarena chaturbhedo

gunamaya prakruti viyuktam | Mahat avyaktaat | Sarga sthiti   
antakaaleshu iti cha paathah |*** These are the forms of *Bhagavaan * which are under the sway of *triguna - **sattva, rajas, tamas. Chaturmukha Brahma * is also *trigunaatmaka. **Manu*, *Daksha prajaapatis, Yama, Agni *- all are *trigunaatmaka. Hari * being  [[645]] the *antaryaami*, all these denote the *antaryaami * also. Words which denote the *shareera * go up to the *shareeri * in *aparyavasaana vrutti*. All these *chetanaas * are *triguna vashyaas*. Though they are the *shareera * of Him, their defects don't touch Him. It is established in the *Vedaas * that He is *apahata paapma*. He is present as inseparably associated. Everything is His mode. It can be said that everything is Him only. *Srushti, sthiti * and *naasha* - are the three states. In these three states, He is present in four different forms. That was told so far, and is concluded here. It is superior to *Chaturmukha Brahma * and the *devaas. Aguna * means not that it is without any attribute or quality, but that it is separated from the three qualities of *prakruti, sattva, rajas * and *tamas*. It is superior to unmanifest or *avyakta*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 42:   
Tat cha jnyaanamayam vyaapi sva samvedyam \(noo\) anoupamam |

This is also told as *Paramaatma svaroopa* because it is also a *visheshana* of *Paramaatman* only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tat cha iti | Jnyaanamayam jnyaana prachuram | Vyaapi jnyaanena |

Here, *Paramapada * told is *mukta svaroopa*, the essential nature of *mukta*. This is also of four forms. *Mukta svaroopa * is *jnyaanamaya*, it has abundance of consciousness; it is *vyaapi*, it is all pervading due to attributive consciousness; it is *sva samvedya*, it knows itself, it reveals to itself; it is *anoupamam*, incomparable. 



*Paramapada * is a word used to describe three different things. One is *Paramaatman. Padyate iti padam *- that which is attained.  [[646]] A *mukta* attains *Paramaatman*; he goes to *Paramapada * and then attains *Paramaatman. Paramapada * is also a *sthaana*, the abode of *Vishnu. **Mukta svaroopa * is also *Paramapada*, because the *jeevaatman * attains his original full form, which is also a thing that he attains. This is also explained in *Vedaartha Sangraha * by *Bhaashyakaarar. Roopa * is also *paryaapa **pada * for *shareera. Vapu, tanu, shareera, roopa, amsha, vibhooti *- are all *paryaaya padaas*, they all denote *shareera shareeri bhaava * which is explained by *Bhaashyakaarar * very clearly. 



*Shareera shareeri bhaava * has three relationships - *aadhaara-aadheya, **niyaamaka-niyaamya, sheshi-shesha. Shareera * is told in various *pramaanaas, **Shrutis, Smrutis*, using various words - *amsha, vibhooti, vapu, roopa, tanu, **shareera*. 



Now, *Maitreyar * asks about those four forms 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying the last chapter of *Amsha * 1, Chapter 22, where *Paraasharar * is telling how everything is *Bhagavaan's roopa, Vishnu's * form only. *Vishnu * only is present as everything, whatever is created, everything is His *shareera*, depending on Him, supported by Him, and ruled by Him. Here, the words *tanu, vapu * are used, and everything is *Bhagavaan's shareera*, as per the *shareera shareeri **bhaava*, very clearly established by *Bhagavad Ramanuja * and our *poorva **aachaaryaas*.

The *mukta aatma svaroopa * is also His *prakaara * being His *shareera * only. It is present in four modes - *chatushprakaara*. This *mukta aatma svaroopa * can know itself. *Jeevaatman * has knowership. *Vyaapi * means that in the liberated state, it is all pervading with respect to the *dharma bhoota jnyaana*. It is *jnyaana prachura*, with abundance of consciousness. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tat cha iti | Jnyaanamayam jnyaana prachuram | Vyaapi jnyaanena |

Now, *Maitreyar * asks *Sri Paraasharar * to explain the four *prakaaraas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 43:   
Maitreyah -   
Chatushprakaarataam tasya \(jnyaana\) brahma bhootasya vai mune |   
Mamaachakshva yathaanyaayam yat uktam param padam ||*** *Maitreya *- The four forms - which is also a *Paramaatman's * form, the *mukta **svaroopa*, which is attained by the *jeevaatmans * when they get dissociated from *prakruti*, when they will be present in their original form, when the *dharma bhoota jnyaana * is in its original state. That is of four stages or modes. 



In this world, whatever we desire to possess, accomplish, that object which we desire to accomplish is the *saadhya*, goal to be accomplished; *saadhya * is  [[648]] that which is achieved or attained. The means to acquire that goal is called *saadhana*. The *saadhya * and *saadhana * are of several varieties, based on the desire of each person and the means to attain them. In this context, the *saadhya * for a *yogi * who desires to get rid of *samsaara * is the *mukta **aatma svaroopa*. He is in bound state and wants to attain liberated state. Bound state is associated with *prakruti * due to *karma*; now he wants to get rid of this, put an end to the birth and death cycle, and and attain the state of liberation. The *mukta aatma svaroopa * is separated from *prakruti **sambandha*. That *mukta aatma svaroopa * is called *Brahman * here; this is also a form of *Brahman*. In order to attain this *aatma svaroopa*, the *saadhana * is *praanaayaama * and such things, and this is told in the *yoga **shaastra*; this knowledge comes from study of *yoga shaastra*. Knowledge of the *praanaayaama * and such *saadhana*, which is about the *mukta aatma **svaroopa*, who is *jnyaana maya*, is the first *bheda*, first part. Knowledge about *mukta aatma svaroopa * which is *saadhya*, which comes from this *saadhana*, after adopting the means, *praanaayama*, etc., is the second *bheda*, second part, which comes from the *shaastra *- this is *shaastra **janya jnyaana*. After this, merging the *saadhya * and *saadhana bhaava **sambandha*, the knowledge of *shuddha aatma svaroopa*, which is without the differentiation of *deva, manushya*, etc., arises; this has the abundance of *aatma svaroopa jnyaana*, which is known as *dhyaana*; this is the third *bheda*. Then comes *aatma saakshaatkaara*. The *bhedaas * are knowledge of *saadhana*, knowledge of *saadhya*, getting rid of differentiation between *deva manushya * and others through *dhyaana*, then *aatma **saakshaatkaara*. In the *aatma saakshaatkaara * stage, the *yogi * does not consider any of the *saadhya saadhana * aspects as they are all opposed to *aatma avalokana*; he will be only in the experience of *aatma avalokana*, and fully immersed in *aatma avalokana*; all thoughts of all other aspects are rejected and only *aatma avalokana * ensues. This *aatma **svaroopa * is *nirvyaapaara*. The object of experience in this stage is *aatman*, and in this stage, thoughts of *saadhana, anushthaana * are all absent, as the *yogi * has already reached the stage of perception of self experience. This is the gist of the *shlokaas * which we are studying now. ***

Sri Paraasharah - *** [[649]] ***Maitreya kaaranam proktam saadhanam sarva vastushu |   
Saadhyam cha vastu abhimatam yat saadhayitum aatmanah ||*** *Sri Paraasharar *- In all objects of attainment, *saadhana * is the means, and *saadhya * is whatever one wants to acquire or achieve. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:*** ***Tasya chaaturvidyam darshayitum upakramate maitreya ityaadibhih |

Yogino mukti kaamasya praanaayaama aadi saadhanam |   
Saadhyam cha paramam brahma punah na aavartate yatah ||*** For a *yogi * who is desirous of attaining liberation from *samsaara, **praanaayaama * and others are the *saadhana*, the means. That which is going to be attained is said to be *paramam brahma*, the *mukta aatma **svaroopa * separated from *prakruti sambandha*, from which he does not return back. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Yogino iti | Paramam brahma mukta svaroopam \* Sarva brahma mayo   
harih iti vachanaat prakruti purushayoh api brahmatvam | Tat   
apekshayaa mukta svaroopasya parama brahmatvam |*** *Paramam brahma * is *mukta svaroopa * itself. It is told that *Hari * only is everything and *prakruti * and *purusha * are all said to be *Brahma * only, because they are all modes of *Brahma. Brahma * only is present in all those forms. When *prakruti purusha * is itself told as *Brahma*, the *mukta svaroopa * is superior to that, and is told as *Paramam Brahma*. These words - the meanings have to be understood according to context. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 46:   
Saadhanaa aalambanam jnyaanam muktaye yoginaam hi yat |

Ubhayoh to avibhaagena saadhya saadhanayoh hi yat |   
Vijnyaanam advaitamayam tat bhaago anyo mayaa uditah ||*** Knowing that *praanaayaama * is the means, and *aatma svaroopa * is to be attained, associating both and practicing that, and then reaching the state where there is no differentiation between *deva, manushya*, etc., the *aatma **aatma saamya * is experienced. *Yogi * goes into the state of *dhyaana*, where he experiences the *aatma aatma saamya*, that all *aatmaas * are *jnyaana **svaroopa * and there is no *manushya, deva bheda*; that this is all due to karma, and this is *prakruti*, and not related to *aatma svaroopa. Aatma **svaroopa * is similar everywhere. This is the third part. The differences which we see here, are because of *deva, manushya*, etc., which are forms of *prakruti*. All *jeevaatmans * inside are *jnyaana svaroopa*, there is *aatma **aatma saamya*, is the *advaita * told here. 



 [[651]] ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 49:   
Jnyaana trayasya cha etasya vishesho yo mahaamune |   
Tat niraakarana dvaara darshita aatma svaroopavat ||** *The *saadhana, saadhya*, and the *dhyaana *- rejecting them, meaning that not thinking about them, which is the route to attaining perception of the self, realizing the self, knowledge of the form of perceiving the nature of the self, is the fourth part. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

jnyaanam chaturtho bhaaga iti aanushangah | ***



Before this, everything is told as *Bhagavaan's roopa, tanu*. So, it is always associated with *Paramaatman*. This *aatma svaroopa saakshaatkaara*, is not *kaivalya*, it is not without *Paramaatman*, it is experiencing it as *shareera * of *Paramaatman*, with *apruthak siddha sambandha*. That is why it is told that he does not return back. This is the real *aatma **svaroopa * experienced as being subservient to *Paramaatman*, ever associated with *Paramaatman*. This is understood here, as this is what is being told. 



Perceiving the self directly, putting an end to all these conceptions of *saadhana, saadhya*, etc., one attains *aatma saakshaatkaara*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 50:   
Nirvyaapaaram anaakhyeyam vyaapti maatram anoopamam |   
Aatma sambodha vishayam sattaa maatram alakshanam ||*** This is the nature of *mukta aatma svaroopa*. See Commentary below.

|*** The last stage is *samaadhi*. When one has reached the state of *samaadhi*, if one is thinking about other things - *saadhana, saadhya*, etc., it is actually opposed to experience of the self. For one who has achieved *samaadhi*, thinking of other things is opposed to *aatma avalokana*. Not thinking about anything else, is said to be the path to attaining *aatma saakshaatkaara*. One who is perceiving the *aatma svaroopa*, the nature of that *aatma svaroopa*, the object of that perception, is going to be told here. *Nirvyaapaara * means that there is no *saadhana anushthaana. Anaakhyeya * means that form, class, differentiation is not there. *Vyaapti maatram * means that the *dharma **bhoota jnyaana * which is *sankuchita*, contracted due to *karma*, becomes fully evolved when the *karma bandha * is removed; it becomes all pervasive. *Anoopamam * means without comparison. *Aatma sambodha **vishayam * means that it knows about itself. *Sattaa maatram * means that it is just present, without the *shat bhaava vikaaraas * of *asti, jaayate, vardhate, **viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*; it is just said to be *sat. **Alakshanam * means it cannot be inferred through something else; we infer fire on seeing smoke, this is not like that; cannot be inferred through logic or inference.

Durvibhaavyam * means it cannot be established through logic, or cannot imagine a form for the *mukta aatma **svaroopa*. This is the form of *Vishnu * only, being *shareera * of *Vishnu*, which is also known by the name *Brahma *- this *jnyaana * is told like this. ***

Not thinking of anything else, realizing the real nature of *aatman*, they get rid of this *karma **bandha*, they get separated from *upaadhi, karma*. They will attain their original real state. It is in the field of *samsaara * where the seeds are sown, *jeevaatmans * are going from birth to birth just like the seeds which are sown in the field of *samsaara*. For the *mukta aatmans*, this is not there. The paddy grain which is sown without the outer shell, will not grow into a plant, they will become like that, is the example given here; they will not  [[654]] come into *samsaara * again.

| ***There are two things - one which is present in one place, and one which is spread all over, and very much associated with fire itself. *Prabhaavat * is the *agni*, and *prabhaa * is the brightness. There is a difference between *prabhaa * and *prabhaavat*. From this, the relationship between the *chetana achetana *- this whole world which is said to be *shakti * of *Paramaatman*, and *Paramaatman*, is told as brightness and fire. *Bhagavaan * is in the place of *prabhaavat*, and the whole world is in the place of brightness, *prabhaa, jyotsnaa*. Difference between the *Paramaatman * and the world is told clearly here. This *pramaana * is used by *Bhaashyakaarar * in *Sri Bhaashya*, which is quoted by *Sri Engal **Aalwaan * here. What is established by *Bhaashyakaarar * in *Sri Bhaashya * is that the source of light and its brightness, are different and distinct, though they are inseparably associated. *Jagat * includes the *jeevaatman * who is having the *shareera * here, and also the *mukta aatma. Jeeva * who is qualified by the body - the embodied soul, and the liberated soul - both are included in the  [[657]] word *jagat * here. In the second *adhyaaya * of *Brahma Sutraas * while commenting on Sri *Bhaashya*, in the Third *Paada*, the *Sutra * 45 is *Prakaashaadivattu naivam parah*. This *adhikarana * is known as the *Amshaadhikarana*, where it is established that all *chetana achetana * are in *visheshya-visheshana amsha, Paramaatman * is *visheshya*, and is different and distinct. So, the *svaroopa * and *svabhaava * of *chetana achetana * are very different and distinct from *Paramaatman. Prakaasha * becomes the *amsha * of *Aaditya * and *Agni*. A qualified object, quality of the attribute is called *amsha*. This *shloka * is quoted in *Sutra * 3.46 of *Sri Bhaashya*, just like the brightness and object, *shakti * and that which has the *shakti*, is nothing but the *shareera aatma bhaava, amsha amshi bhaava. **Jagat * is *Paramaatman's amsha*, and He is *amshi. Jagat * is *Paramaatman's **shareera * and He is *aatma*. This is also quoted by *Sri Engal Aalwaan * here to show that this is a very important *pramaana * for our *siddhaanta*.

It will be told that there is difference in *dharma bhoota jnyaana * of various beings. That which is closer to the fire and that which is a little far away from the fire; the brightness reduces as the distance increases from the source of the light, and it is more near the source of the light. There is a difference in the brightness, and there is a differentiation in *Paramaatman's **shakti * also. *Paramaatman's shakti * is nothing but *jagat*, His *shareera. **Jagat * includes the embodied souls and liberated souls.

Whereas *Bhagavaan * incarnates Himself as *Vishnu*, among the Trinity. So, *Vishnu * is His own *avataara*. What is going to be told for various kinds of beings, how there is a difference in their *jnyaana * and *shakti*, is told. Initially it was told that in the stage of *aatma svaroopa aavirbhaava * in the *dhyaana * state, all these differences disappear, and *aatma aatma **saamya * was told. The *taaratamya * which is told here - that one is more and one is less, is due to the karma and the *dharma bhoota jnyaana * and not in the *svaroopa*. *Svaroopa * is same for all the *aatmans*; all are *jnyaana aananda **svaroopa*. Differences that are told in *jnyaana * are because they are covered by *karma*; that is why one has more *jnyaana * and another has less *jnyaana. **Chaturmukha Brahma * has more *jnyaana*, his *dharma bhoota jnyaana * is more expanded, compared to *Daksha * and others. 



This is a very important *pramaana * in *Vishnu Puraana * which our *Aachaaryaas * quote, to show that the *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes contraction and expansion.  [[659]] 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying the last chapter of *Amsha* 1, Chapter 22, where everything that is created is *Bhagavaan's **vibhooti * only, the *moorta * and *amoorta roopa * of *Bhagavaan*, which was told by *Sri Paraasharar*. ***

 ****Baddha jeevaas * are all told as *kshara*, and the *mukta aatmaas * are told as *akshara*. How the whole world is inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*, and at the same time, it is also a *padaartha * by itself, *chetana achetana aatmaka prapancha * is *Bhagavaan's roopa, vibhooti, * [[660]] *shareera*, is being told. As the brightness spreads all over, from the fire which is located in one place; the brightness is very much a part of the fire, but it is different compared to the fire itself; it is like the attribute of the fire. In the same way, the entire world is *shakti * of *Paramaatman*; the *baddhaas * and *muktaas * are both included in the *jagat*. In this world, we have all beings who are embodied souls and there are liberated selves in *Paramapada*. These embodied souls and liberated selves are like *shakti * of *Paramaatman*; like the brightness of fire; they are inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*; this is being told here.

This is just like the brightness of fire which is more near the fire, and less at a distance. Like this, in the *shaktis * of *Bhagavaan * also, there is a difference in their *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*, attributive consciousness. There is a difference among all beings starting from *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and up to the *sthaavaraas*, the lowest of the beings. In some it is more, and in some it is less.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 58:   
Brahma vishnu shivaa brahman pradhaanaa brahma shaktayah |

krutam |*** *Chaturmukha Brahma * and *Shiva * are being the *shareera * of *Paramaatman; **shakti * is also a *paryaaya pada * for *shareera*, meaning controlled, meant for His purpose, and supported by *Paramaatman*, and having this relationship. Among the trinity, *Vishnu * is a direct *avataara * of *Paramaatman * Himself. *Devaas*, other gods are lower, inferior compared to them \( *Brahma, Vishnu * and *Shiva*\), means that with respect to knowledge and capability or powers. Compared to *Devaas, Daksha **Prajaapati * and others are having still lesser knowledge and powers. This is an important explanation in the commentary - that the *taaratamya *\(difference\) which is told, why is there this difference - because the nature of all these embodied souls is that they are all *jeevaatman*, except *Vishnu * who is an *avataara * of *Paramaatman * Himself. All embodied souls in their essential nature are all the same, *jnyaana **svaroopa*, though they are different beings. The *taaratamya * is in the *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and why is this difference coming - this difference is because of the *karmaas*, the respective *karmaas * of those individual selves. One individual self becomes *Chaturmukha Brahma*, another one becomes *Shiva*, another *Indra, Varuna, Daksha Prajaapati*, etc., they are all created like this, and the difference in their attributive knowledge is because of karma done in their previous births. The *dharma **bhoota jnyaana * in the original state is fully evolved for everyone, whereas here, it is hidden or covered by the karma. When the *karma bandhana * goes, they get liberated, and the *dharma bhoota jnyaana * shines forth in its original state; it is not created at that time, but it just exists in its natural state. It is not due to *svaroopa * but due to *karma * that there is difference in *dharma bhoota jnyaana * of these individual selves.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 59:   
Tato manushyaah pashavo mruga pakshi sareesrupaah |   
Nyoonaa nyoonataraah cha eva vruksha gulmaadayah tathaa ||*** Compared to *Daksha Prajaapati * and others, the humans, *manushyaas * are  [[662]] having still less *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and *shakti*. The animals, deer and others, cow and others, birds and snakes are having still less. Comparatively, each has lesser and lesser knowledge and powers. Compared to them, still less is there in trees, herbs, etc. 



In *Vedaartha Sangraha, Sri Bhaashyakaarar * says that anything which has name and form can have a *jeevaatman * in it. But its *dharma bhoota **jnyaana * will be so less that it does not exhibit that kind of knowledge.

Means that it is endless, His form is never-ending, there are innumerable beings in this world. The number of individual souls cannot be counted, they are innumerable. They are called *nitya * because they are all created, but existing in the *kaarana*. The *kaarya * or effect exists in the *kaarana * which is the cause, this is called *satkaaryavaada*. In this case, all the *chetana achetanaatmaka prapancha * is existing in the *sookshma **roopa*, subtle form in *Bhagavaan * during *pralaya*; at that time, there is no name and form differentiation; when creation happens, they all come into the gross state; so the *kaarya * actually exists in the *kaarana*; because there is unbroken chain of creation, sustenance and dissolution - these are going on happening without any break. Another way to tell *nityatva * is *pravaaha **nityatva*, because there is on Indra or Agni or *Varuna * or *Chaturmukha **Brahma * all the time. If the time of one *Chaturmukha Brahma * gets over,  [[663]] another being comes into that position; this is called *pravaaha nityatva. **Aavirbhaava * and *tirobhaava * means *sankocha * and *vikaasa*, increase or reduction in *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and this itself is told as *janma * and *naasha*, birth and death.

Please do tell me about that divine form of *Bhagavaan * which is supporting all the *tattvaas*, this whole world as ornaments and weapons. 



Now, *Paraasharar * starts to tell the *astra bhooshana * form of *Paramaatman*. This is how we do worship *Bhagavaan * also everyday. *Sri Bhaashyakaarar * has written one work called *Nitya Grantha*, which says how the *Bhagavad **Aaraadhana * has to be done. In the very beginning, *Bhaashyakaarar * says ' *Atha parama ekaantino bhagavad aaraadhana prayogam vakshye*' - that we  [[666]] have to do *aaraadhana * of all the *bhooshanaas, astraas*, individually, one by one, as *chetanaas*. We can also see this in *Kriyaa Deepa * by *Sri Paraashara **Bhattar*.

It is told in the last Chapter of *Brahma Sutraas*, the Fourth *Adhyaaya*, where, when the *karma **bandha * goes, the *jeevaatman's dharma bhoota jnyaana * expands, becomes all pervasive and shines forth in its original state; there is a doubt put there whether it is newly created; an example is given, just like a gem is there covered by dust, when the dust is removed, the gem shines forth by itself; this shining is not newly created; it is already present in the gem; this is the very nature of the gem itself; it is not seen because it is covered by dust; when the dust is removed, it shines forth in its natural state; in the same  [[667]] way, when the *jeevaatman* whose *dharma bhoota jnyaana * is covered or hidden by the *karmaas*, when the *karma bandha * is removed, his *dharma **bhoota jnyaana * becomes all pervasive; it shines forth in its natural state and is not newly created. For this, this *shloka * is told - just as the brightness is not created for a gem when it is cleaned up, so jeevaatman is mani saamya, similarity is shown with a gem which has that kind of shine. There is a Brahma Sutra, *Gunaat vaa aalokavat*; there is an *Upanishadic mantra * which says - *Sa cha aanantyaaya kalpate*; he becomes *ananta * not in his *svaroopa * but in his *dharma*. The *aanantya * is in his *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*, the all pervasiveness that he achieves is in his attributive consciousness; like the brightness of a light which is hidden, when the block is removed, the light shines forth everywhere. Because of this, the *koustubha mani saamya * is told for the *jeevaatmans*. The word *aatmaanam * is told, in singular; it is not one *aatma*, but it is the entire collectivity of the *aatmans*; or it can be the class of *aatmans * told. ***

This form is not because of *karma. Maayaa * is told as *aascharya*. Why does He support all these, and why do people meditate upon Him. For the *shreyas * of this whole world - one can see a divine auspicious form of *Bhagavaan * having *bhooshana * and *astra * and enjoy; for continuous meditation again and again; one can do *naama sankeertana*; for the prosperity and good of this whole world; and also in order to establish *dharma*. All the *shaktis * are present in the divine auspicious form of *Bhagavaan*; this form is due to His own *sankalpa*; He is the controller of  [[672]] everything. In *Jitanta stotra*, does not mean that He does not have form and *aakaara*, He can also be present without form as *antaryaami*; He has a divine auspicious form which is eternal, present all the time with Him; this form is not for Him, but for the devotees to meditate upon. 



Bound selves get form because of *karma*, in order to experience the *punya * and *paapa phalaas*. 



*Maayaa * is told as *aascharya shakti*; we have seen that *Shambaraasura * created so many *maayaas * which were all destroyed.

***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying the wonderful way in which *Bhagavaan * supports all the *tattvaas*, in the form of *astraas * and *bhooshanaas * in His *Divya Mangala Vigraha*, His divine auspicious form, which is for doing ultimate good for the whole world, *Sri **Paraasharar * says.

*Vedaanta * is told separately, compared to *Rk, Yajus, Saama, Atharva*, because of its importance. *Bhagavat svaroopa * is established separately there. In our *siddhaanta, Poorva Kaanda * and *Uttara Kaanda * are given equal importance. This is established very clearly in *Sri Bhaashya, Vedaartha **Sangraha*, of *Bhagavad Ramanuja*, and all the *Aachaaryaas * that the entire *Veda * is given equal importance. *Poorva Kaanda * is *Bhagavat **Aaraadhana prakaara*, and *Uttara Kaanda * is telling *Bhagavat Svaroopa*.

Shabda moorti dharasya etat vapuh vishnoh mahaatmanah || ****Kaavyaas, prabandhaas, geetha *- all are *shareera, vapu * of *Mahaa Vishnu*. 



*Bhaashyakaarar * says that the *lakshana * for *shareera * is that it is a *dravya*. How can *shabda * be called as *vapu*, because *shabda * is not a *dravya*. This is explained as *Vedaabhimaani devataa*. For all these, there are *abhimaani **devataas*. When we say *vapu, shareera*, the *abhimaani devataas * are to be taken. This is how it is explained. All the *Vedaas * are supported by *Bhagavaan * only, as *Swami Deshikan * says. During *praakruta pralaya*, even *Chaturmukha Brahma * does not exist. *Vedaas * are said to be *nitya*, and are said be there in *Bhagavaan's jnyaana*. When *Bhagvaan * does the *srushti * again, *Bhagavaan * teaches *Chaturmukha Brahma*, in the same way as it was earlier. This *nityatva * is what makes the *Vedaas apourusheya*. Then *Chaturmukha Brahma * teaches to all the *rishis*. He also creates the *rishis * based on the previous *karmaas, sukrutaas*, by which they do *tapas * and *saakshaatkaara * of *Veda bhaagaas*. So, *Vedaas * are all existing as it is, and is not created by *Bhagavaan*; but He does *upadesha. Vedaas * will always be there in *Bhagavaan's jnyaana*, in the same form all the time, and will never change; the order is most important. *Bhaashyakaarar * says in *Vedaartha Sangraha * that the *loukika shabdaas * and *Vaidika shabdaas * are all coming from *Vedaas * only. The difference is that in the *loukika shabdaas*, there is no *aanupoorvi nityatva*, no *krama nityatva*. Whereas *Vedaas * are always being taught in the same order, in the *guru shishya paramparaa*.

Everything is inseparably associated with Him in *shareera **shareeri bhaava*. One who does this kind of *anusandhaana*, one who fully realizes this, he will not suffer from the dualities of this life creation again; all the sufferings due to duality, which are coming from this *samsaara*, will not happen to such a person who realizes this fully and does this kind of *anusandhaana*.

There are two interpretations for this - the *Kaartika maasa Pushkara snaana * once in twelve years, is said to be very sacred; one who takes bath in that, is one meaning; the other meaning is for twelve years, every year, during *Kaartika maasa * taking *Pushkara snaana*. The fruit which he gets will come to one who listens to this First *Amsha * of *Vishnu Puraana*. O *Maitreya*, all this *phala * one gets by listening to this *Amsha * itself.
