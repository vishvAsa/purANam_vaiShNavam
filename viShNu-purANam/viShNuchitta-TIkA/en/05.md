I want to know about *Vishnu's avataara*. He incarnated in *Yadukula*. That I would like to know in great detail. The name *Vishnu* is from *vishalr vyaaptou* - it is a *vyaapaka naamadheya*. It shows his all pervasiveness. *Vishnu* means *Naaraayana* who is all pervading. His *avataara*, the *Krishnaavataara*, I would like to know about that in detail.

 ***One who knows about the *avataara*, and also the " *janma karma cha me divyam*", and all His *aascharya chesthitaas*, 



In all His incarnations, He is always *paripoorna* only, in every aspect - *svaroopa, **roopa, guna*. He is only said to be *amsha*, or *amshaamsha*, because out of His own will, He takes on a limited form of a human or deva, and He remains Himself in that form. This is said to be *amsha* of *Vishnu*. But, He is always *poorna* in every aspect in every incarnation. Even in His *avataaraas* where He reveals Himself in limited form of a human, like *Krishnaavataara*, we can see His *sarvaishvarya*, that He is all pervading, *Sarveshvara*, when He shows His *vishvaroopa*.

 ***Please do not kill her, I will give you all the children, and you can do whatever you want. 



It should have been " *Asyaah udarodbhavaan*", but it is " *Asya udarodbhavaan*". This is *Aarsha prayoga, rishi prayoga*, which we have to take as it is. It can also have the meaning as " *tava*", yours. Or it can also mean " *mama*", which is through me, *Vasudeva*. *Shruti* says that a child is nothing but the father, father who is again reborn. *Smruti* also says this.

 ****Bhoomi Devi - Agni* is the guru of gold. Sun is the guru of the cows. For me, *Naaraayana* is the *guru*, who is the *Guru* of all. HE is without a guru. 



*Naaraayana* is one who does not have a guru, because *guru* means *kaaranavaachee*. There is a *pramaana* from *Samvartta smruti* - Gold is said to be born of *Tejas, Agni. Bhoodevi* is from *Vishnu*. All the cows are born from Sun. One who donates gold or a cow, or some land, is equivalent to donating all the three worlds. That is the greatness of these three.

He is also the Lord of *Prajaapati*. He existed before anyone else. He is only present in the form of *kalaa, kaashtha, nimesha, kaala, avyakta*. He takes the form of all these things. 



Everything is *shareera* to Him. The *shareera* is as told by *Bhaashyakaarar*, that which is controlled, supported, and is existing for the purpose of the *shareeri*. These are the three relationships all the time. This is *shareera-shareeri bhaava. *

*Amsha* is *shareera. Amsha* is also told in the *Brahma Sutraas, Amsho naanaa **vyapadeshaat*, in *Amshaadhikarana. Visheshana Amsha* and *Visheshya Amsha*. Everything is *visheshana* to Him, being His *shareera*. *Roopa, amsha, tanu, kaaya, **vapu*, are all *paryaaya padaas*, telling shareera in so many ways, established by *Bhaashyakaarar* in *Vedaarthasangraha, Bhaashya*.

 ****Brahma* - He addresses *Bhagavaan* as *Anaamnaaya*. Two *vidyaas* are told. Your two forms are there - *moorta* and *amoorta*. 



There are two *shlokaas* which are a single sentence. *Anaamnaaya* means one whose nature, qualities cannot be explained as this much only, by the *Shrutis. **Shrutis* are unable to tell all His qualities in full. It is not able to tell the *aananda **guna* itself. Shruti just says " *Yato vaacho nivartante, apraapya manasaa saha*",  [[10]] of 399

words cannot describe Him fully, and mind cannot know Him fully. He can be described and known, but not fully. Two *vidyaas* are told - *Paraa vidyaa* and *Aparaa vidyaa*. This also comes in *Mundakopanishad. Paraa vidyaa* is the *upaasane*, and *Aparaa vidyaa* is the *tattvajnyaana*, obtained from the *Vedaas*. One is that obtained through *shabda*, and another is through *viveka*, discriminatory knowledge, *jnyaana*. From *Aagamaas, Shabda Brahma* can be known. *Parabrahma* can be known through *Viveka*. One is through textual knowledge, and the other is through meditation, *nidhidhyaasana. Shravana, **manana, nidhidhyaasana* are told; first through textual knowledge, then through contemplation, and then *upaasane, Parabrahma* can be reached. These are explained here as two *vidyaas - Paraa vidyaa* and *Aparaa vidyaa*, that which is manifest and that which is unmanifest. In respect of *Brahman*, *Brahma vishaya*, that which is born if *viveka* is the knowledge. *Shabda* *Brahma* is obtained through *Aagamaas*. One is *Para*, one is *Apara*. These are the two *vidyaas* explained here. In *Upanishads*, it is told about *Moorta* and *Amoorta Brahma*. Or, it can be *Prakruti* and *Purusha*, they are also Your form only. That which is the most subtle, and that which is in the gross form, You are the *aatman*. It is told for *Bhagavaan*, that *Anaadi, Akratu. Anaamnaaya* can also be taken as that Your form is *Anaadi, **Akratu*. This is the gist - there are two *roopaas*, one is *Shabda* *Brahma* which is *Aagamaja*, and another is *Parambrahma* which is *Vivekaja*. Initially, the textual knowledge is known by study of the text, and then through contemplation, meditation, one has to experience, which is *Vivekaja*. These are the two - *Paraa* and *Aparaa vidyaas. ** **

 ***Having told the *karma pratipaadaka bhaaga*, now, *Brahma pratipaadaka bhaaga* is being told here. The *karma pratipaadaka bhaaga* is about the *aaraadhana **bhaaga* of the Lord. *Upanishad bhaaga* is the *aaraadhya* *svaroopa*. That is also You only. *Jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman* are the first *aatma* told here. The second *aatma* is the *sookshma shareera. Deha* is *sthoola shareera. Gunavat* means the m *oola prakruti, pradhaana. Sookshma shareera, sthoola shareera*, the two *aatmans - jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman*, then *Avyakta \(moola prakruti\)*, all these are the topics discussed in the *Upanishad bhaaga*. These are all Your form only. 



The *Veda bhaaga*, the *pravartana* is done by You only. They are all telling about You only. All are controlled by You only. They are all related to You. Everything is from You only. 





These *shlokaas* are talking about the various forms of *Bhagavaan*. *

 ***You cannot be perceived by the external senses. You cannot be told as belonging to same class as anything else. You cannot be thought of through mind. The *mukta aatma svaroopa* does not have the deva, *manushya*, these names. Does not have colour also, like white or red. Does not have hands and legs. Does not have *karma* and other *kleshaas*. This can also be explained with respect to *Paramaatman*. 



*Jeevaatma svaroopa* is also supported by You only, controlled by You only. Having told about the *baddha jeevaas*, now, the *muktaatman* is also Your *shareera* only.

 ***Compared to the *jeevaatman* who himself is subtle, You are still more subtle. You are without a visible form. One who sees You, all their *ajnyaana* will get destroyed. *Dheerasya* is repeated. One *dheera* is an *upaasaka, dhiyaa ramate iti **dheerah*, an *upaasaka*. Another way to break is " *dheeh asya*". An *upaasaka* will never think about anything other than You, his mind will always be focussed on You, is the meaning. From that most auspicious form of Yours, other than that, the mind of the *upaasaka* will never contemplate on anything else. When such an *upaasaka* is seeing You, one who beholds You through *upaasane*, his *karma* will get completely destroyed, forever. Or we can also take this as two sentences, the first part as one sentence, and the second part as another. The *dheeh* part - such a person's *sankalpa* only bears everything, this is about *Paramaatman*. Because of this, there is nobody other than You, there is nobody equal or greater than You. *Paramaatman* supports everything through *sankalpa* itself.

*Tretaagni* are the three *agnis - Gaarhapatya, Aavahaneeya* and *Daakshinaagni*. These, and *Upaasanaagni* - all these four are You only.

You are only the *agni* present in these four forms. You only give all the siddhis - *Animaa, Laghimaa, **Garimaa*, etc. You are the controller of all that, and because of You only, objects  [[15]] of 399

have those capabilities, *devataas* have their capabilities. You are present in infinite forms. You are like the eyes of the whole world. 



*Bhagavaan's aascharya svaroopa* is being explained in this part of the *Vishnu **Puraana*. Which we continue next. 



In *Trivikrama avataara*, You were so big that You occupied all the three worlds. *Sri **Engal Aalwaan* quotes from *Aitareya Braahmana*. In the Deva *Asura yuddha, **Vishnu* says that three steps whatever He occupies can belong to the *Devaas*, and He occupied all the worlds with three steps. In *Nirukta* it is told by *Yaaska* that the act or mounting or ascending, and *Vishnupada* is a hill marked with the footprints of *Vishnu*, in *Gaya*, as told in *Mahaabhaarata*. Or the western horizon is also called *Gayashiras*. Or *Ksheerasamudra* can also be told as *Vishnupada*. Or it can also be told as when the Sun enters a sign of the zodiac, the first sign after equinox. 



We are studying Chapter 1 of *Amsha* 5. Where we are studying the *Brahma Stuti **of Bhagavaan Sri Vishnu*.

 ****Bhagavaan* is the *jagadeka kaarana. Kaaranaavasthaa* is said to be the *sookshma **chit achit vishishta brahma*, and the *kaarya avasthaa* is said to be *sthoola chit **achit vishishta brahma*. This is how *Bhaashyakaarar* has established in a wonderful way. You are the manifest and unmanifest form. *Samashti* is the collective creation, which is undifferentiated. *Vyashti* is where name and form are differentiated. After the *naama* *roopa vyaakarana, vyashti strushti* starts. All the forms are You only. 



All the sentient and non sentients, in the *kaarya* and *kaarana avasthaa*, this is the *visishtaadvaita. Sookshma chit achit vishishta brahma* becomes *sthoola chit achit **vishishta brahma*, both are *Brahman* only, and everything is *Brahmaatmaka. **Samashti* is said to be *avyakta.

During the stage where *naama roopa **vibhajana* is done, when there is differentiation into names and forms, this is said to be *vyashti*, *vyakta*, manifest.

 ***The meaning of *kaarana* here is purpose, or *sukha*, joy, happiness. *Akaarana* is lack of purpose, or sorrow. *Kaaranaakaarana* is mix of both *sukha* and *dukha*. Why do You take *shareera*, why do You manifest Yourself as a human being, in *Raama, Krishna*, etc. *avataaraas* - it is not for the experience of *sukha* or *dukha*, or both *sukha* and *dukha*. You take Your *avataaras* only to protect dharma. He is all pervasive. 



The gist of this is explained here. You don't take *shareera* for these three reasons - *sukha* only, *dukha* only, or both *sukha* and *dukha*. Those who go to *svarga*, only enjoy there, there is only *sukha*. Those who go to *naraka*, only get *dukha*. Those who come to *manushya loka*, get both, *ubhaabhyaam manushya lokah, sukha* and *dukha*. You are not taking a form because of any of these reasons. For experiencing the fruits of adharma, going to *naraka*, Your *shareera grahana* is not like that. And those who are in svarga, enjoying the fruits of *dharma*, that is also not the reason why You take Your form. Or like *manushya*, getting both *sukha* and  [[19]] of 399 



www.sadagopan.org



*dukha*. Your *shareera* is only for protecting *dharma*. There is another meaning given here - *ka aarana*. That which leads to *sukha*. This word *arana* is used in *Vedas* itself. *Brahmana ut aranam asi. Brahmana udeeranamasi*. This is told as *Brahma praapaka*. In this meaning, *kaarana* means *dharma* which leads to enjoyment of *sukha*. The opposite of this, *akaarana* becomes *adharma. Sukha, **dukha* both are *kaaranaakaarana*. The three *janmas* - animal, *devaas, manushya*, are got because of *dukha*, *sukha*, or a mixture of both. You are *karmaadhyaksha*, You are not *karma* *vashya*. Your *avataaras* are for none of these reasons. " *Sambhavaami* *aatma maayayaa*", is what *Bhagavaan* says, His own *sankalpa*. Out of Your own will, You take on forms here and incarnate. He takes any form that He wants out of His own will, His own *sankalpa*, and that is not because of *karma*.

 ****Vasudeva's* another wife, *Rohini*, is in *Gokula*. 



*Rohini* will be pregnant at that time. It is told in *Harivamsha* that *Rohini* will be pregnant with *Vasudeva's* child, and she would have gone to *Gokula*. When it reaches the seventh month, her womb will be in the *Vaayu roopa*; at that time, take that womb and bring it to *Devaki's* *garbha*; and what is in *Devaki's garbha*, the white *Amsha, tejas, * which is *Shesha*, take this *garbha* to *Rohini*. So, that nobody will get a doubt when the child is born in the ninth month. This exchange of *garbhaas* should happen, Lord *Hari* tells *Yoganidraa*.

We just saw Chapter 1 of *Amsha* 5. Where *Bhagavaan* has told *Yoga nidraa* what all should be done as preparations before He can incarnate. As per this, He said that the six children of *Kamsa* have to be brought and placed in *Devaki's garbha*. The seventh one will be another *amsha* of *Bhagavaan, Balaraama*, and after that, He will Himself incarnate, and at the same time, *Yoga nidraa* will also enter into *Yashoda's* womb, and *Balaraama* will go to *Rohini's garbha*. He tells *Yoga nidraa* that she will attain a good position, and will be praised by everyone, as *Durgaa*, and people will offer all kinds of offerings, and that she will bestow them with various benefits that they seek.

Accordingly, *Yoga nidraa* carries out all of this. ***

Having told thus, the *Devi, Yoganidraa*, who had taken this form, wearing the most wonderful garlands, *gandha*, clothes, ornaments, as *Kamsa* was seeing, just went off being eulogized by all the *siddhaas*, she just went away. 



This completes Chapter Three. This is the *Krishnaavataara* *ghatta*, the most wonderful part where *Krishna* incarnated.

We just saw Chapter 4 of *Amsha* 5, where *Kamsa* recalls the words of *Durgaa* that the person who kills him is already born, so he calls all the *asuraas Pralamba, **Dhenuka, Keshi, Pootanaa*, and others, and tells them to be cautions and watch out, and says that he is not scared of Indra or *Hari*. He is so arrogant with his powers that nobody can do any harm to him. He says that even then, we have to be very careful and cautious, because the gods are always trying to kill him. Any child, if seen with extraordinary powers, just kill that child, he instructs them. Then he frees *Devaki* and *Vasudeva* and then retires. The story of *Krishna* continues now, the *Krishnaavataara*.

The yearly taxes and others that you have paid. When the king comes to know that someone is very rich, they may tax more money, and it is not a good thing. That was not the real intention of *Vasudeva*. Why he said that is that *Krishna* is there, and *Nandagopa* has to go there, and look after him, so that he should not stay here longer, because *Kamsa* may start thinking of doing some harm.

This evil serpent was defeated by *Garuda*, who is also a *vibhooti* of Krishna only. So, " *mayaa*" is told as " *mat vibhooti bhootena*". This evil serpent was not seen by Garuda, otherwise, he would have been driven away or killed, so he was hiding in the waters that time. He has escaped from the ocean, and has come into this *Kaalindi* river, this pool, because of a story in *Bhaagavata* which is referred here. Garuda was cursed by *Soubhari. Garuda* was interested in eating the fishes living there, and *Soubhari* cursed him not to come there. So, Garuda could not enter into this particular *Kaalindi* river, so, *Kaaliya* was very safe there. So, *Kaaliya* came and lived there.

Just as the rain clouds give up all the water, the yogis gave up all the *ahamkaara*, and *mamakaara*. Clouds gave up the blackness because there was no more water, the yogis who have realized, got rid of the defects like *raaga, dvesha*, etc., they became pure. The clouds became white and clear, and like this, the yogis became pure, their minds became very pure. The *jnyaanis* give up all the *virodha*. 



Each shloka is giving a description of the *sharat kaala*, with many of the words having the meaning of *aatma vidyaa* also. This is being explained further. There are many more wonderful *shlokaas* like this. Which we see next. 



Having given up all the waters, through rain, the sky became very clear. The clouds gave up all water through rain. The sky became clear without any clouds. It was as though the wise ones, knowledgeable ones, the enlightened ones, they leave their houses and go for meditation, tapas. 



Having given up the *ahamkaara*, their minds became pure. The blackness with respect to the clouds; the rain bearing clouds are black, and when they pour down the rain, the waters are no more there, they become clear. With respect to yogis, they gave up the *raaga, dvesha*, etc., and their minds became clean. The skies became clear, and with respect to yogis, their mind became pure.

He is having the *jeevaatman* also as His a *atma, shareera. ** *The first *shloka* \( *shloka* 61\) says that He is having all the *chetanaas* as His *shareera*.

 ***Even if someone meditates on Him, and just remembers, that destroys all the sins. That form, that face of *Bhagavaan*, I am going to see. 



The form of *Krishna* is out of His own *sankalpa*, that He has incarnated here. *Aditi, **Devaki* worshipped *Bhagavaan* for many many years, and got a boon from Him that He will be born here, as their son. According to this, He takes the form of *deva*, *manushya*, as *Upendra, Krishna*. This is common to even *vibhava avataaras*. In the *Bhagavad Gita, Krishna* says that "Whatever form one worships Me in, I will  [[170]] of 399

reveal Myself to them in the same form". *Taam tathaa eva bhajaami*, where *bhajaami* *upaasanaa * means *darshayaami* according to *Bhaashyakaarar*. Even in the, when one meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, in their *hrudaya*, He gives a similar experience to them. Or, He takes different forms out of His own will. In the meditation also, whatever form we see outside, we have to think of the same form inside also, inside our mind.

Just before sunset, when the Sun was just setting, at that time, *Akroora* reached *Gokula*, all the time thinking with great devotion, about *Sri Krishna*. 



At *Gokula, Akroora* sees *Krishna's* wonderful form and eulogizes Him. How he sees this wonderful form of *Krishna*, and the *darshana* that he gets, and things which happen after that, are going to start from here, which we see next. 



We are doing *arthaanusandhaana* of Chapter 17 of *Amsha* 5. Where *Akroora* has been sent by *Kamsa*, to bring *Krishna* and *Balaraama* to the *Dhanuryajnya*, with the wicked idea that he wants to eliminate Them. All the *gopaas* also bring in plenty of milk, butter, curd, etc., to offer to *Kamsa*. While coming, *Akroora* is thinking of the wonderful *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan Krishna*, and is continuously meditating on this, and his entire *janma* has become *saphala* because he is going to behold *Bhagavaan Sri Krishna*, right in front of his eyes. He has just reached *Gokula*.

 ***Then *Akroora* realized what is the truth. Then he prayed to and eulogized the *Sarvajnya, Achyuta*, who is the Lord, *Krishna. Akroora* starts to eulogize. 



Now, the *Akroora Stuti* is going to start, which we see next. We are studying of Chapter 18 of *Amsha* 5, where *Akroora* is sent by *Kamsa*, and is taking back *Krishna* and *Balaraama*, to *Mathura*, with *Kamsa's* bad intentions. On the way, he stopped to do his *maadhyaahnika*, and at that time, he takes a dip in the river. He sees the most wonderful sight, where he has the *saakshaatkaara* of *Bhagavaan*. He sees *Krishna* and *Balaraama* there. He then starts to eulogize *Bhagavaan*, based on that wonderful sight that he had.

There are so many wonderful attributes which are *asaadhaarana gunaas* of *Paramaatman*; nobody can even think of His greatness. He is the *Paramaatman*, the Supreme Self. He is all pervading. He has got many forms. He is also *ekasvaroopa*, one unique *svaroopa*. I bow down to that Supreme Self. I bow down to that *Paramaatman*.

The *shat bhaava vikaaraas* are *Asti, Jaayate, Vardhate, Viparinamate, **Apaksheeyate, Nashyati*. In the state of effect, where everything is created, after *Brahman* does *anupravesha*, and He says " *Bahusyaam* *prajaayeya*", "Let Me become many", and He brings all the *chetana* and *achetana* into gross form, being the inner self of everything and is all pervading. He is only present in all these forms, because everything is His mode, being His *shareera*; so He is *Naikaroopa*, He has many forms. At the same time, in the state of cause, Causal state, where everything is merged unto Him, and is existing in an extremely subtle state, along with Him, without being distinguishable as a separate entity, united in Him - this is *Ekaroopa*. These are the state of Effect and the Causal state.

www.sadagopan.org





We are studying Chapter 23 of *Amsha* 5, where the story of *Kaalayavana* being killed by *Muchukunda* is being studied. *Kaalayavana* attacks *Mathura*, and Krishna thinking that if *Kaalayavana* and *Jaraasandha* both are there, it will become a problem for them, and gets the *Dwaarakaa Puri* built. And shifts all the people from *Mathura Puri* to *Dwaaraakaa*, so that they are all very safe in the ocean. *Krishna* goes alone to *Mathura Puri*, and when He comes out of the city, *Kaalayavana* sees Him unarmed, and chases Him. *Paraasharar* says that even great yogis cannot catch *Krishna* with their minds, *Kaalayavana* is trying to catch Him. 



*Krishna* runs away as though scared, and enters a huge cave, which is very dark inside. There, *Kaalayavana* sees someone lying down, and thinks that it is *Krishna*, and kicks him with his foot. And it happens to be *Muchukunda* who had helped the gods, during the deva-asura war. They had given him a boon, and he had asked for long rest, as he was very tired, and wanted to take rest for a very long time. They also told him that if anyone disturbs him during his sleep, the moment he sees them, that person will be burnt then and there. When *Muchukunda* was sleeping there, *Kaalayavana* without knowing, kicked him and woke him up, and when *Muchukunda* saw him, *Kaalayavana* was burnt immediately. Thus, *Krishna* gets *Kaalayavana* killed.

*Sri Paraasharar* continues with *Krishna* going after *Narakaasura*, and next is the *Narakaasura vadha prakarana* which comes. We see this next. 



We are studying Chapter 29 of *Amsha* 5. Where *Indra* has just arrived and met *Sri **Krishna*, and tells Him about how *Narakaasura* is troubling everyone, and that he has stolen all valuable things from svarga, *Indraloka. Narakaasura* has stolen the *kundala* of Indra's mother Aditi, has stolen the *chatra* of *Varuna* himself, and the peak of *Meru* *parvata* itself. Now, *Narakaasura* is after the *Airaavata* elephant. Indra requests *Krishna* to do something so that *Narakaasura's* tortures will all stop, all his troubles will stop. 



*Indra* says that he has told all the bad things which *Narakaasura* is doing, and now requests *Krishna* to do whatever is right for this.

Immediately, *Krishna* thought of *Garuda*, and immediately, *Garuda* came there. Taking *Satyabhaama* also along, *Krishna* got onto *Garuda*, and started to go towards *Praagjyotishapura*, where *Narakaasura* was living. 



*Satyabhaama* was *Amsha* of *Bhoomidevi*. *Bhoomi's* son was *Narakaasura*, and *Krishna* had given a word that He would kill her son only with her permission, and since *Satyabhaama* was *Bhoomidevi's amsha*, He took *Satyabhaama* along, as He knew that He would destroy *Narakaasura*. In *Harivamsha* it is also told that *Naarada* brings a *Paarijaata* flower from *Devaloka*, and gives it to *Rukmini*. When *Satyabhaama* sees this, she is immediately jealous of *Rukmini*, that she got such a wonderful flower from heaven, and she did not get it. So, *Krishna* had told here that He would get her the entire tree itself. In order to fulfil this also, *Krishna* took *Satyabhaama* along with Him.

A demon by name *Mura* had created a huge strong net around *Praagjyotishapura*, which was as sharp as a razor's edge, in order to protect the city. So, nobody could enter into that city. *Praagjyotishapura* was covered like this all around.

Having worshipped You, what the people seek is the different things they desire. They do not ask for *samsaara kshaya*. They aspire only for meagre desires. They worship You and seek meagre things from You. But they do not think of escaping from *samsaara*. This is all because of *maayaa*, and this *maayaa* is Your only; it is also Your *shareera*, and You are only controlling it.

If you are dear to your husband Indra, and if your husband is in your control, then my husband is stealing this tree, ask her to try to stop this - *Satyabhaama* tells with lot of arrogance, being very angry.

Knowing all of these, being a human, I am stealing this *Paarijaata*. She tells the people protecting the *Paarijaata* - Go and tell *Shachee* that *Satyabhaama* has told all these things. 



Next comes the description about how the *Paarijaata* tree will be taken, and the fight which ensues, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 30 of *Amsha* 5. In this, the *Paarijaata apaharana **prasanga*, where *Krishna*, after killing *Narakaasura*, comes to *devaloka*, and when they are going around all the wonderful gardens of the gods there, the *Paarijaata* tree, which is there most wonderfully, with bunches of flowers all over, and fragrance spreading many *yojanaas*. Earlier, *Shachee Devi* does not offer *Paarijaata* flower to *Satyabhaama*, thinking that she is a mere human, and does not deserve to be given that flower, that it is only meant for devaas. Seeing all this, *Satyabhaama* tells *Krishna* - "If You really like me so much as You say so many times, take this *Paarijaata* tree to our garden. I want to have it there". Then, all the people protecting that *Paarijaata* tree, warn her, and say that this is only meant for *Shachee Devi*, and *Indra* will not allow them to go free like that, and that they will be in trouble. But then, *Satyabhaama* is very arrogant and gives the message to *Shachee Devi*, and tells them to go and tell their lord *Indra* and also *Shachee Devi*, that *Satyabhaama* is telling like this. She says - "Being a mere human, I am taking it away, and if anyone has the powers, let them stop me. Go and tell *Shachee Devi* that I know her husband *Indra*, and being a human, I am taking it away. Let me see if anyone stops me".

Immediately, *Shachee Devi* tells *Indra* that he should go and stop them.

Usha sees *Aniruddha* in her dream, and her friend *Chitralekha* draws the paintings, and she is able to identify him. *Chitralekha* has the *yogic* powers where she can go unseen, and bring *Aniruddha*, and she says that she will definitely help. And she leaves, and says that she will return very quickly. She asks *Usha* to bear the separation till she comes back, bringing *Aniruddha*. And then she goes to *Dwaaravati*. This concluded the Chapter Thirty Two.

But, *Naarada* cleared that doubt and said that *Chitralekha* had taken him with her *yogic* powers. 



In *Harivamsha*, it is told that because *Devaas* were not happy that the *Paarijaata* was taken by *Krishna*, maybe they had caught and taken *Aniruddha* away.

You are all lowly people compared to us. Even then, with love, we respected you, even though we should have actually disrespected you. Instead of that, we offered you same seat and food.

Respecting the words of the *Brahmins*, the *Rishis, Durvaasa Rishi*, whatever he had told, He stayed in the *yogic* pose, lifting His *paada* on the knee. 



Respecting the curse of the *Brahmins*, and respecting whatever *Durvaasa* had told, He made His legs in the form of a *Svastikaasana*, on His knee, and sat in *Yogaasana*. 



In the *Mahaabhaarata*, it is said that *Durvaasa* asked *Krishna* to smear His entire body with what *Durvaasa* had eaten and left. *Krishna* thought that the food eaten and left by a *Brahmin*, should not be touched with the foot. So, *Krishna* did not smear it for His foot, but smeared it for the rest of His body. *Durvaasa* got very angry and asked "Why did You not smear it on Your feet? You will be hit on the foot itself", and gave Him a curse. Because of this, *Krishna* sat in that position, to respect *Durvaasa's* curse, and also curse of the *Brahmins*.
