*Maitreya* - In the first *Amsha, Paraasharar* told about creation. After *srushti, sthiti* was told in second, third and fourth *Amshaas*. After creation, *Vamsha*, *Vamshaanucharita, Manvantara*, are about the sustenance part. This was told in detail.

Now, I would like to listen about pralaya from you. About the *mahaa pralaya*, and *kalpaanta upasamhruti, kalpaanta pralaya*. About the *pralaya* which happens at the end of the *kalpa*, and also the *mahaa pralaya*, I would like to listen from you.

*Sri Paraasharar - O Maitreya*, do listen. I am going to tell you how *pralaya* happens at the end of the *kalpa*, and also the *praakruta pralaya*, how it happens. 



There are two halves - first *Paraardha* and second *Paraardha*. In this, whatever is the pralaya which is going to be told, that will be at the end of the *dviteeya* *Paraardha* of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. I will tell you that.

And 2000 *deva varshaas* is the *sandhi kaala*, as was told in the earlier *Amshaas*.

By nature, means by their measure, and dharma and adharma, how much is there, and how they are there, the *chaturyugaas* are all very similar. *Harivamsha* is quoted here. *Dharma* is standing on four legs in *Kruta yuga*, and *adharma* is there in one *paada* towards the end of *Kruta yuga*. In *Tretaa yuga, dharma* is standing on three legs, and *adharma* in two legs. In the *Dvaapara yuga, dharma* is standing on two legs, and *adharma* on three legs. In *Kali yuga, adharma* is on four legs. The meaning of this is that in the beginning, at the end of *Kruta yuga* itself, *adharma* is on one *paada*. Then *adharma* gradually increases, becomes two, three, and becomes four at the start of *Kali yuga*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 In the beginning, how *Chaturmukha Brahma* creates, in the same way, at the end of *Kali yuga*, he does *upasamhaara*, dissolution happens by *Chaturmukha **Brahma*. 



*Chaturmukha Brahma* creates means that *Bhagavaan* is *antaryaami* to *Chaturmukha Brahma*. So, *Bhagavaan* Himself, through *Chaturmukha Brahma* does the creation. This is the uniqueness of beginning and end because there is creation and dissolution. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 8: *****मैत्रेयः * - *****कलेः * *****थवरूपं * *****भर्वन् * *****ववथतरात् * *****वक्रुम् * *****अहगमस * | *****र्मगश्चतुष्पात् * *****भर्वान् * *****यस्थमन् * *****ववप्लवमृच्छतत * *****॥ * *****८ * *****॥ * ****Maitreyar* - Please do tell me about the nature of *Kali yuga*, in detail. How the dharma which was on four legs in the *Kruta yuga*, is totally not there in *Kali yuga*, I would like to know. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 9: *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****कलेः * *****थवरूपं * *****मैत्रेय * *****यत् * *****भावाञ्छ्िोततम् * *****इच्छतत * | *****तस्न्नबोर् * *****समासेन * *****वतगते * *****यन्महामुने * *****॥ * *****९ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - This *Kali svaroopa* which you want to know, O *Maitreyar*, I am going to tell you briefly. Do listen to me.

*Varnaashrama dharmaas* which are told in *Smrutis* in detail - are not present in *Kali yuga*, people do not follow them. The *Rig, Yajus, Saama Vedaas* are there - these are *Shrouta*; whatever are told there - *Agnihotra* and other *dharmaas*, which are told there, and by performance of that only is dharma established. This  [[4]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 does not happen in *Kali yuga*. People do not follow *Agnihotra* and other dharma *kaaryaas* which are told in the *Vedaas*, in the *Kali yuga*. So, they are not there. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 11: *****वववाहा * *****न * *****कलौ * *****र्म्याग * *****न * *****मशष्यर्ुरुसंस्थथततः * | *****न * *****िांपत्यक्रमो * *****नैव * *****वस्ह्निेवात्मकः * *****क्रमः * *****॥ * *****११ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****वववाहा * *****इतत * | *****िांपत्यक्रमः * *****िंपत्योः * *****र्मगः *, *****िंपती * *****एव * *****िाम्पत्यम् * | *****वस्ह्निेवात्मकः * *****वह्नौ * *****िेवयज् * *****क्रक्रयात्मकः * | *****क्रमः * *****अनुष्ठानम् * | ***



*Vivaaha* does not happen as told in the *Shaastraas*. Even the order of student and teacher does not exist. The husband-wife system is also not there. Offering *havis* through *Agni* to the *devataas* through *yajnya yaagaas* is also not there. 



*Dharmya* means *dharmaat anapetam*, which is in line with dharma. 



The dharma of husband and wife, offering *havis* to *devataas*, is not there - the *anusthaana* of these does not happen. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 12: *****यत्र * *****कुत्र * *****कुले * *****जातो * *****बली * *****सवेश्वरः * *****कलौ * | *****सवेभ्य * *****एव * *****वणेभ्यो * *****योग्यः * *****कन्यावरोर्ने * *****॥ * *****१२ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****यत्र * *****कुत्र * *****इतत * | *****वणेभ्यः * *****वणागनां * *****र्नी * *****योग्यः *, *****न * *****तु * *****वृत्तववद्यादिमान् * | ***



Whichever *kula* one is born, if powerful, he only rules over, he becomes *sarveshvara*. In all the *varnaas*, one who is rich becomes powerful, and not by his character, education, wisdom. Only one who is rich is sought after for marriage. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 13: *****येन * *****केन * *****च * *****योर्ेन * *****द्ववजाततिीक्षितः * *****कलौ * | *****यैव * *****सैव * *****च * *****मैत्रेय * *****प्रायस्श्चत्तं * *****कलौ * *****क्रक्रया * *****॥ * *****१३ * *****॥ *

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 



The *Brahmins* who take *deeksha*, through *samskaaraas* - the *mukha kalpa* is not followed, only the *anukalpa* is followed. *Anukalpaas* are told for those who are incapable of following the *mukhya kalpa*. In *Kali yuga*, only *anukalpaas* are followed, and *mukhya kalpaas* are not followed. And they do *praayaschitta* by any means, and not as told in the *shaastraas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 14: *****सवगमेव * *****कलौ * *****शाथत्रं * *****यथय * *****यद्वचनं * *****द्ववज * | *****िेवता * *****च * *****कलौ * *****सवाग * *****सवगथसवगथय * *****चाश्रमः * *****॥ * *****१४ * *****॥ *

Everything is *shaastra* in *Kali yuga*. Whoever says anything becomes *shaastra*. *Avaidika* like *Kaali* also become *devataas*. Every god is treated as *devataa*, whoever is worshipped. If *Brahmacharya* is not there also, he can get married. If *vairaagya* is not there also, he can become *sannyaasi*. Like this, anyone can take any *aashrama*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 15: *****उपवासः * *****तथा * *****आयासो * *****ववत्तोत्सर्गः * *****तपः * *****कलौ * | *****र्मो * *****यथा * *****अमभरुगचतैः * *****अनुष्ठानैरनुस्ष्ठतः * *****॥ * *****१५ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****उपवास * *****इतत * | *****आयासः * *****तीथगयात्रादिकायक्लेशः * | *****उपवासादिः * *****थवामभरुगचत * *****अनुष्ठान * *****अनुस्ष्ठतो * *****र्मो * *****भवतत * | ***



*Upavaasa, teertha yaatraa*, giving money in daana, tapas, and others - whoever does it in any way, that is how it is followed. And not as per *shaastraas*. So, *kaaya* *klesha* by *teertha yaatraa* is as they desire. It is not as told in the *shaastraas*, that is not dharma. Whoever does whatever becomes *dharma* in all these aspects. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 16: *****ववत्तेन * *****भववता * *****पुंसां * *****थवल्पेनाढ्यमिः * *****कलौ * | *****थत्रीणां * *****रूपमिश्चैवं * *****केशैरेव * *****भववष्यतत * *****॥ * *****१६ * *****॥ * ***



 [[6]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Even with little bit wealth, they become arrogant that they are very wealthy. Women also become arrogant because they look good, merely through the beauty of their hair. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 17: *****सुवणगमणणरत्नािौ * *****वथत्र * *****चोपियं * *****र्ते * | *****कलौ * *****स्थत्रयो * *****भववष्यस्न्त * *****तिा * *****केशैरलंकृताः * *****॥ * *****१७ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****सुवणगमणण * *****इतत * | *****केशैः * *****प्रशथतैः *, *****सुवणागदिभूषणसहपाठात् * | ***



*Suvarna*, *mani, ratna*, good clothes, become very less in use. They decorate themselves with whatever good is available, and not necessarily with these. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 18: *****पररत्यक्ष्यस्न्त * *****भतागरं * *****ववत्तहीनं * *****तथा * *****स्थत्रयः * | *****भताग * *****भववष्यतत * *****कलौ * *****ववत्तवानेव * *****योवषताम् * *****॥ * *****१८ * *****॥ * ***Women will desert husbands who do not have money. Whoever has money is only accepted as husband. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 19: *****यो * *****वै * *****ििातत * *****बहुलं * *****थवं * *****स * *****थवामी * *****सिा * *****नृणाम् * | *****थवाममत्वहेतुः * *****सांबन्र्ो * *****न * *****चामभजनता * *****तथा * *****॥ * *****१९ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****य * *****इतत * | *****थवाममत्वहेतुररतत * | *****बहु * *****अथगिानादिना * *****संबन्र् * *****एव * *****थवाममत्वहेतुः * *****भावी *, *****न * *****तु * *****अमभजनः * *****थवाममत्वहेतुः * *****संबन्र्ो * *****भववता * *****अमभजन * *****इतत * *****पाठे * *****थवाममत्वहेतुः * *****वसुिानादि * *****संबन्र्ः *, *****स * *****एव * *****अमभजनः * *****न * *****तु * *****महाकुलीनत्वम् * | *****हीनवणो * *****अवप * *****अथगिो * *****महाकुलीनवत्सेव्य * *****इतत * *****अथगः * | ***



Whoever gives more becomes the lord. One who gives a lot of money, only becomes the master or the lord. Not necessarily one born in a good *varna*, a good *kula*, etc. Giving a lot of clothes, doing a lot of donation, one becomes the master. He only is treated as belonging to a very high class, and not one who is born in a good *kula*. Though he is of a lower *varna*, if he has a lot of money, he is treated as belonging to a higher class.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 20: *** [[7]] of 194

Whatever material is collected is all kept in the house, for purpose of maintaining the house only. One's intelligence is used only for earning money, and not for *aatmajnyaana*. All the money earned is only for constructing houses. All the *yaagaas, homaas*, which are performed, the money earned is not used for that purpose. Also, the money earned, used for constructing houses, maintaining, is all for one's own enjoyment, and not for treating guests, not for *atithi satkaara*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 1, Shloka 21: *****थत्रोयः * *****कलौ * *****भववष्यस्न्त * *****थवैररण्यो * *****लमलतथपृहाः * | *****अन्यायािप्तववत्तेषु * *****पुरुषाः * *****थपृहयालवः * *****॥ * *****२१ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****स्थत्रय * *****इतत * | *****लमलतेषु * *****पुरुषेषु * *****थपृहा * *****यासां * *****ताथतथोक्ताः * | ***



Women get interested only in men who talks nicely. They will become highly independent. Men will be desirous of only money which is not earned in the right way.

Though even a close friend requests a lot, they do not give even a little bit. They expect a lot of personal gains only. They do not give even a half handful, and will be interested in keeping it. They do not even part with half handful of anything, and even for that, they expect a lot of personal gains, from their own friends also.

Even the *Shoodraas* who belong to a lower class, they treat the higher classes like Brahmins as though they are equal in intelligence, *tejas* and others. Cows which are respected based on only how much milk they give.

He completely took a dip in the water, and told. *Paraasharar* is telling that his son told like this, after getting up from the water, so that everyone can listen. He took a dip in the water, and again got up. He told " *Shoodrah saadhuh, kalih saadhuh*".

He took a dip again, and again got up. He said that women are all very fortunate. He said - "Who is more fortunate than them?". 



*Kaliyuga* is good. *Shoodraas* are fortunate. Women are more fortunate.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Sri Paraasharar* - Having heard them, *Vyaasa* smiled mildly and said "O great sages, do listen to me. About why I said *saadhu saadhu*". 



"You don't even know this, is also the intended meaning here". He gave the answer himself, and even though he gave the answer, the sages were not aware of that, so he was laughing, that they were not able to understand.

In *Dvaapara yuga*, it can be achieved within one month. In *Kali* *yuga*, it can be achieved in one day and night. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 16: *****तपसो * *****ब्रह्मचयगथय * *****जपािेः * *****च * *****फलं * *****द्ववजाः * | *****प्राप्नोतत * *****पुरुषथतेन * *****कमलथसास्ध्वतत * *****भावषतम् * *****॥ * *****१६ * *****॥ * ****Tapas, Brahmacharya, Japa*, etc., 12 years *tapas* has to be done in *Kruta yuga*, it can be done in one year by *Brahmacharya* in *Tretaa yuga*. And by *japa* and others in *Dvaapara*. And in *Kali yuga*, it can be achieved in one day itself. 



Whatever is done by *Tapas, Brahmacharya, Japa*, it can be achieved in *Kali yuga* in one day. That is why I said that *Kali* is *saadhu*.

In *Kruta yuga*, one has to do meditation, *dhyaana*. In *Kruta yuga*, it is possible for one to achieve purity of mind by meditation only, to get any fruits. In *Tretaa yuga*, people will not have the capability to do that kind of *dhyaana*, meditation. So,  [[22]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 they can perform *yajnyaas* and can achieve the same fruits. In *Dvaapara yuga*, if one is not able to do meditation, or perform *yajnyaas*, they can just worship *Bhagavaan, archanaa, bhagavat poojaa*, and attain the same fruits. In Kali yuga, even if one is not able to do all these *dhyaana, yajnya, archanaa*, etc., mere chanting of *Bhagavaan's* auspicious names, itself, with that one can achieve all the fruits that one can achieve through *dhyaana* in *Kruta yuga*, or through *yajnyaas* in *Tretaa yuga*, or through *archanaa* in *Dvaapara yuga*. In *Kali yuga*, it is very difficult to do all these, by mere *naama sankeertana*, one can achieve all those fruits. That is why I said *Kali* is *saadhu*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 18: *****र्मोत्कषगमतीवात्र * *****प्राप्नोतत * *****पुरुषः * *****कलौ * | *****अल्पायासेन * *****र्मगथतेन * *****तुष्िो * *****अथम्यहं * *****कलौ * *****॥ * *****१८ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****एतत् * *****एव * *****वववृणोतत * | *****र्मग * *****इतत * | *****थवल्पायासेन * *****संकीतगनादिना * | ***



With very little effort, they achieve great dharma, they get all the fruits. And they become *dhaarmikaas, dharmajnyaas* in *Kali yuga*. That is why I am very happy with *Kali yuga*. By mere *Bhagavannaama sankeertana*. 





*

Till now, how *Kali* is *saadhu* has been told. Because, by mere *naama sankeertana*, one can achieve anything that needs to be achieved through dhy *aana, yajnya, **archanaa* in other *yugaas*. Now, *Vyaasa* explains why he said that " *shoodrah* *saadhuh*". Performing all the *vrataas*, if one has to do *Veda adhyayana*. In a proper way, they have to do *yaaga* and other things as per *vidhi*. And they have to earn money through the right way, virtuous means, and with that only, they have to perform *yajnya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 20: *****वृथा * *****कथा * *****वृथा * *****भोज्यं * *****वृथेज्या * *****च * *****द्ववजन्मनाम् * | *****पतनाय * *****ततो * *****भाव्यं * *****तैथतु * *****संयमममभथसिा * *****॥ * *****२० * *****॥ * *** [[23]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 The *Brahmins* have very strict guidance from *shaastraas* and other things, they should not be talking about unnecessary things. They cannot eat whatever they can lay their hands on. There is a lot of niyama for what they should speak, what they should not speak, what they should eat and not eat. And also for performing *yajnyaas*, there is *adhikaara*, who can perform what *yajnya*, how he has to perform, there are many conditions, *niyamaas, vrataas* for *Brahmins*. If they do not follow all of this, they will fall down from dharma. And they will be subjected to *Bhagavaan's nigraha*. They have to be always controlling the senses. They have to do all these as told in the *shaastraas*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 21: *****असम्याक्करणे * *****िोषः * *****तेषां * *****सवेषु * *****वथतुषु * | *****भोज्यपेयादिकं * *****चैषां * *****नेच्छाप्रास्प्तकरं * *****द्ववजाः * *****॥ * *****२१ * *****॥ *

If they don't do properly whatever is told in the *shaastraas*, they will be subjected to punishment. For whatever they do, they have to follow the *shaastraas* and do it properly. Like what to eat, what to drink, etc. They cannot do whatever they desire. They have to strictly follow the *shaastraas*. They have rules for everything. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 22: *****पारतन््यं * *****समथतेषु * *****तेषां * *****कायेषु * *****वै * *****यतः * | *****जयस्न्त * *****ते * *****तनजांल्लोकान् * *****क्लेशेन * *****महता * *****द्ववजाः * *****॥ * *****२२ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****अत्र * *****हेतुः * *****पारतन््यम् * *****इतत * | *****पारतन््यं * *****ववगर्पारतन््यम् * | ***



They have *vidhi paaratantrya* in everything that they do, depending on what is ordained in the *shaastraas*. They have to follow very strictly in every act that they do. With that only, they can go to svarga and other *lokaas* with great difficulty. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 23: *****द्ववजशुश्रूषयैवैष * *****पाकयज्ागर्कारवान् * | *****तनजाज्जयतत * *****वै * *****लोकान् * *****शूद्रो * *****र्न्यतरः * *****ततः * *****॥ * *****२३ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *** [[24]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 **द्ववजशुश्रूषयैवेतत * | *****पाकयज्ागर्कारवान् * *****शूद्रथयाप्यमन्त्रकपक्वहोत्मादिषु * *****अगर्कारः * | *****अथमै * *****सार्ुचररतममतत * *****शेषः * | ***



Whereas for *Shoodraas*, all these *niyamaas* are not there. These rules are there for the *traivarnikaas - Braahmanaas, Kshatriyaas* and *Vaishyaas*. Whereas for *Shoodraas*, they have to serve the other three *varnaas*. They also have to do the *yajnyaas* without *mantraas*, without *pranava*. And they can also participate in other things like cooking. Just by this only, by serving the *Brahmins*, and other *Vedaadhikaaris*, by participating in cooking and others, and performing the *mahaa yajnyaas* without *mantraas*, they can earn the *svarga* and other *lokaas*. Which other *Brahmins* can earn by strict rules and with great difficulty. *Shoodraas* can earn this very easily. *Shoodraas* can do *homa* and other things without *mantra*. This also came earlier in Vishnu *Puraana*. That is why *Shoodraas* are told to be very fortunate. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 24: *****भक्ष्याभक्ष्येषु * *****नाथयास्थत * *****पेयापेयेवष * *****वै * *****यतः * | *****तनयमो * *****मुतनशािगूलाः * *****तेनासौ * *****सास्ध्वतीररतः * *****॥ * *****२४ * *****॥ * ***There is no niyama about what they can eat and not eat for *Shoodraas*. They can eat and drink anything they like. That is why I said that they are *saadhu*. It is very easy to earn the *punya lokaas*, just by merely serving the other classes, and also by doing *amantraka yajnya* and other things. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 25: *****थवर्मगथयाववरोर्ेन * *****तनरैलगब्र्ं * *****र्नं * *****सिा * | *****प्रततपािनीयं * *****पात्रेषु * *****यष्िव्यं * *****च * *****यथाववगर् * *****॥ * *****२५ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****थवर्मगथय * *****इतत * | *****थवर्मगथय * *****इतत * *****थत्रीसार्ुत्वथय * *****प्रथतावः * | ***



Now, why women are *saadhutara* is going to be told. Men have to earn whatever they want, and it should not be against their *dharma* - they have to follow dharma and earn money in the righteous ways. They have to also give it to others, and have to perform *yajnya* as ordained in the *shaastraas*. They have to do *daana* for the right person, all these *niyamaas* are there for men. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 26: *****तथयाजगने * *****महाक्लेशः * *****पालने * *****च * *****द्ववजोत्तमाः * | *** [[25]] of 194

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****तथय * *****इतत * | *****र्हनं * *****क्लेशः * | ***



Earning money is itself very difficult as they have to earn money in the righteous way. They cannot go against what is told in the *shaastraas*. And maintaining that money is much more difficult. And how to distribute it among the deserving, is very difficult. Knowing the inner secrets of all these, the *sookshma amshaas*, is very difficult. Who is the right person for daana, how to give daana, is all difficult, as told in the *Bhagavad Geeta*. It is difficult to know the intricacies of how to perform the *daana*, how to earn money, how to maintain it, etc. But they have to follow all of this. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 27: *****एवमन्यैः * *****तथा * *****क्लेशैः * *****पुरुषा * *****द्ववजसत्तमाः * | *****तनजाञ्छ्जयस्न्त * *****वै * *****लोकान् * *****प्राजापत्यादिकान् * *****क्रमात् * *****॥ * *****२७ * *****॥ * ***Following all these *niyamaas* with great difficulty, they earn all the various *lokaas*, *praajaapatya*, where they can go and enjoy later on. But it is very difficult and tough. One has to be very controlled, and careful in following all of these rules. If, at any time, they transgress the rules of the *Vedaas*, what is ordained, then they will be subjected to punishment. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 2, Shloka 28: *****योवषच्छूश्रणात् * *****भतुगः * *****कमगणा * *****मनसा * *****गर्रा * | *****तद्गर्ता * *****शुभमाप्नोतत * *****तत्सालोक्यं * *****यतो * *****द्ववजाः * *****॥ * *****२८ * *****॥ * ***Whereas, the women, by merely serving her husband, through *kaayaa, vaachaa*, *manasaa*, body, speech and mind, and always doing good to the husband, she will earn all the *lokaas*, which her husband has earned with so much difficulty, following so ,any *vrataas, niyamaas*, as per the *shaastraas*. By merely serving her husband, she will earn all those *lokaas*. 





*

With very little effort or difficulty, she will learn all those things. Whatever men learn with great difficulty. That is why I said " *Yoshitah saadhu*". 



Whatever *lokaas* men get - *Praajaapatya* and others - which men get with so much difficulty and following tough *niyamaas, vrataas* as told in the *shaastraas*, women get by merely serving them, the same thing which the husband gets.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 3, Shloka 1: *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****सवेषामेव * *****भूतानां * *****त्रत्रववर्ः * *****प्रततसञ्छ्चरः * | *****नैममवत्तकः * *****प्राकृततकः * *****तथैवात्यस्न्तको * *****लयः * *****॥ * *****१ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - For all the beings, there are three types of *pralaya*, dissolution. One is *naimittika pralaya*, another is *praakrutika pralaya*, another is *aatyantika **pralaya*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 3, Shloka 2: *****ब्राह्मो * *****नैममवत्तकथतेषां * *****कल्पान्ते * *****प्रततसञ्छ्चरः * | *****आत्यस्न्तकथतु * *****मोिाख्यः * *****प्राकृतो * *****द्ववपरार्गकः * *****॥ * *****२ * *****॥ *

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Naimittika pralaya* is at the end of the *kalpa* of *Brahma*, it is called *Braahma* *naimittika*. Another is *aatyantika pralaya*, which is called *moksha*. The third one is *praakruta pralaya*, which is at the end of *dviparaardha*, the full life of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 



*Paraardha* is one half of *Chaturmukha Brahma's* life. Two *paraardhas* is the two halves together, the complete hundred years of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. At that time, the entire *prakruti mandala*, with all the effects will get merged in *Paramaatman*.

By doubling it, by *dviparaardha*, we have to understand that time duration when the *praakruta pralaya* happens.

*Sri Paraasharar* - From one position to another, as in units, tens, hundreds, each one will be ten times the previous. If we go on counting like that, ten times, and ten times, etc., eighteen times, whatever number is got, that is said to be the *paraardha*. 



First is one, then ten, then hundred, then thousand, then ten thousand, then a lakh, then keep multiplying by ten, we get *prayuta, koti, arbuda, abja, kharva*, *nikharva*, then *mahaasaroja*, then *shanku*, then *samudra*, then *madhya*. The last  [[30]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 one is *paraardha*. The *dviparaardha* of *maanusha* years, whatever count comes for *dviparaardha* is said to be *mahaasamhaara, praakruta* *pralaya*.

Now, the measure of time is told. The human *nimesha*, the measure of that is *maatraa*. The *nimesha* is said to be *maatraa*, as it is of the measure of a *maatraa*. The *laghu akshara*, like *a, ka*, is one *maatraa* time measure, this is called *nimesha*, in human measure. Fifteen of that is called *kaashtha*, and thirty *kaashthaas* form one *kalaa*.

How a *naadikaa* is measured, is told with the measure of a water, 12.5 the measure of a fluid. 



In *Maagadha raajya*, it is called one jalaprastha. 12.5 is the measure of fluid, such a measure of water. From this, the duration of a *naadikaa* is found out. Five *gulaganji* seeds measure is said to be one *maasha*. There is a vessel called *prastha*, which is used in *Maagadha desha*. This vessel is filled with 12.5 measure of water. When it is four times, it is said to be *naadi*. There is a *Naadikaa ghata*, which is a pot of *Naadikaa*, which is four times this jalaprastha. 1.5 measures of water, with a measure called *pala*, when this is made four times, it becomes 50. Fifty measures of water, is taken in a pot. Taking four *maasha* equivalent of gold, and making a pipe out of that, which is four inches long. The pipe is put to that vessel. And 50 measure of water is poured into that. Whatever time is taken for the water to go out, to empty fully, is said to be one *naadi*. Or, there is a pot which holds 50 measure of that water, where *pala* is one measure. 50 measures of that is filled into that pot. In the bottom of that vessel, a hole is made, and a small tube made of gold, which is four inches. This empty vessel is placed, in stable water. The time taken for the water to fill this vessel completely, when the vessel dips completely inside water, that time is said to be *naadi*. So, the measures are either water filling into this pot, or the time taken for the water to go out. This is how a *Naadikaa* is measured.

After that, I will also tell you about *praakruta pralaya*. Listen to me. *Paraasharar* starts to describe the frightful nature, very fierce, nature of that *Naimittika pralaya*. And then, I will also tell you the *Praakruta pralaya*. 



From here, *Paraasharar* continues to explain the nature of *Naimittika pralaya*, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 3 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Paraasharar* has started to describe the *Naimittika pralaya*, and *Praakruta pralaya*. He tells when the *Naimittika pralaya* will happen, and starts to describe that *Naimittika pralaya*.  [[33]] of 194

Then, *Bhagavaan Vishnu*, who takes on the form of *Rudra*, immutable in His nature, starts to do the pralaya, so that they all merge in Him. He Himself, being *antaryaami* of *Rudra*, takes on the form of *Rudra*, and starts to do *pralaya*, where all the beings are going to merge in Him. For withdrawing all the beings, He takes on the form of *Rudra*.

It is told in *Vaayu Puraana*. Those who have performed specific *yaagaas*, and are supposed to enjoy some more fruit, the *Saadhyaas, Pitrus, Manus, Saptarishis*, along with them, they go to *Maharloka*, leaving all this, having left the three *lokaas*. Having left the *Maharloka* also, the fourteen groups of people like *Pitrus*, Manus, etc., along with the same body, the *shareera*, they go to *Janaloka*, along with others. They go above, along with all of them, and again they come back. From *Janaloka*, for ten *kalpaas*, again and again, they come and go, for every *kalpa*. They go to *Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka*, and after that, they go to *Satyaloka*. Having gone to the *Satyaloka*, they do *tapas, yoga*, and they have  [[38]] of 194

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 From *Vishnu's* face, there will be a huge forceful air which comes out, *Vaayu*, from His breath, and it blows so heavily that all the clouds will get dispersed. For more than 100 years, His breath which comes out will disperse all the huge clouds.

When all the clouds are dispersed, and there is no rain, there will be one huge ocean, when all the three worlds are filled with water, there will be an *Ekaarnava*, He will sleep there on *Aadishesha*, taking on the form of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 



*Brahmaroopa dhara* was explained in *Amsha* 1 itself. *Brahma* and others do not have the *shubhaashrayatva*, only *Bhagavaan's Divya Mangala Vigraha* is called as *Shubhaashraya*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Those *siddhaas* who go to *Janaloka*, who cannot even stay in *Maharloka*, being eulogized by *Sanaka* and others, and those who have gone to *Satyaloka*, which is *Brahma loka*, are all meditating upon the *Brahmaroopa dhara*. Being meditated upon by those who desire to get liberated, *Vishnu* who has taken the form of *Chaturmukha Brahma* is sleeping on *Aadishesha*. 



How is this possible, is explained in the Commentary. *Chaturmukha Brahma* and others do not have *shubhaashrayatva* as they are all *karma vashyaas*, being born here. How can *mumukshus*, those who desire liberation, meditate upon this *Chaturmukha Brahma*, is explained here. In *yoga*, we have *dhaarana, dhyaana* and *samaadhi*. The object to be meditated upon is to be firmly fixed in the mind. This *dhaarana* has to be done. In order to achieve this *dhaarana, shubhaashraya* was told. But, those who attain the *samaadhi* state after *dhaarana*, for them, meditating upon *Bhagavaan* who is in the form of the whole world, is not against the *Shrutis*. This is also possible, they can meditate upon Him like this. *Prahlaada* was meditating like this, he was meditating upon himself as *Bhagavaan*, and that everything is created by him only. This is called *Ahamgrahopaasane*, where they meditate upon the *Brahma, aatman* who is the inner self. So, *aham* goes up to the inner self, who is the *Paramaatman*, who is actually the one who is told by every word. So, *aham* goes up to that, this is called as *Aparyavasaanavrutti. Aham* extends up to the *antaryaami Paramaatman*. This is *shareera vishishta*, *jeevaatma vishishta Paramaatman*. They meditate upon the *Paramaatman* who is the inner self of the self. This is not against what is told in the *Shrutis*. When someone meditates upon *Parashuraama, Kalki*, there is *anupravesha* of *Paramaatman* in them, for some time, they are not *Poornaavataara*, but *anupravesha avataaraas*. Whenever *Bhagavaan* enters into them for some particular time, to achieve extraordinary things, at that time, they are *Paramaatma avataara*, it is not a *Poornaavataara*, but *anupravesha avataara*. He does all His exceptional acts during that time. At that time, He is meditated upon like that by *mumukshus*.

The *shabda tanmaatra* will get merged into *bhootaadi. Bhootaadi* is the creator of *Pancha bhootaas*, which is *taamasa ahamkaara*. Along with all the *bhootendriyaas*, it goes and merges. By *bhootaadi* here, the *trividha ahamkaara* is meant, as *indriyaas* are also getting merged. From *saatvika ahamkaara, indriyaas* are created. From *taamasa ahamkaara, tanmaatraas* and *pancha bhootaas* are created. All these get merged in the reverse order during *pralaya*. Only *ahamkaara tattva* will be there.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 comes, *aham aham*, which is the feeling of I, I, *ahamkaara* is responsible for that. This is *bhootaadi*, which is the cause of the *tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. This is known as *taamasa ahamkaara. Bhootaadi* goes and merges into *mahaan, mahat*, which is also *buddhi*. 



All the manifest things get merged into the *pruthivi tattva. Pruthivi tattva* merges into the *gandha tanmaatra*. This goes and merges into *ap tattva*, which merges into *rasa tanmaatra*.

This merges into *sparsha tanmaatra*, which merges into *aakaasha*, which merges into *shabda tanmaatra*. Which merges into *ahamkaara tattva*. *Indriyaas* also merge into *ahamkaara tattva*. The three *ahamkaara tattvaas* merge into *mahat tattva*, which is also told as buddhi. This merges into the *moola* *prakruti*, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 4 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is describing the nature of *Naimittika pralaya* and *Praakruta pralaya*. In the *Praakruta pralaya*, everything happens in the reverse order of creation. In creation, the order is *prakruti, mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. In the reverse order, everything merges in its respective cause. In this, how the *bhootaadi*, the cause of the *bhootaas*, which is *taamasa ahamkaara*, which goes and merges into the *mahat tattva*, is told. This *ahamkaara* is a tattva, a *dravya*. This goes and merges in *mahat*, which is also known as *buddhi*, as it influences the mind while making decisions. In some *darshanaas*, it is taken as an *antahkarana* also. ***

When there is any disturbance in that proportion, one of them becomes more or less, immediately, at that time and place, creation starts. Moola *prakruti* is like a huge ocean, and in that, in some parts, the sattva, rajas, tamas get imbalanced; immediately, at that place, one *Brahmaanda* is created, and creation starts - *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. So, these are like the waves in a huge ocean. *Brahmaandaas* are getting created and dissolved. When there is *guna saamya*, then pralaya happens. When there is a *guna vaishamya*, creation happens. When the *gunaas* are equal, when nothing is less or more, the *pradhaana* which is the *moola prakruti*, which is the cause of all the *praakruta* substances.

This *prakruti* which is having *vyakta* \(the manifest part, which is having name and form, what we see in this world, the millions of things we see around\) and *avyakta* \(the *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhoota tattvaas*\), all of them will go and merge in *avyakta*. 



How can *vyakta avasthaa* go and merge in *avyakta*? Normally, something goes and merges in its cause only. So, can *vyakta* be an effect of the *avyakta*? Yes, because it is all *praakruta*, it is the same substance. Everything that we see in this world has name and form, is all *praakruta*, it is all *prakruti parinaama, avyakta **parinaama*. Everything is having *sattva, rajas, tamas*, these three qualities, which are there in *moola prakruti*. Everything is *prakruti dravya* only, but they are getting modified every moment and present in various states. Same *prakruti **dravya* goes into a different state, called *mahat*, then it changes into another state called *ahamkaara*. The *dravya* is same, it is not a new substance which is created. Everything is *trigunaatmaka prakruti* only. Even the *avyakta avasthaa* is *prakruti dravya* only. Therefore, *vyakta* goes and merges into *avyakta*.

This tells about the sentient part, the *chetanaas. Chetana* does not undergo modification in his essential nature. He is not told like *prakruti* which gets modified into many forms. There is no *vaichitrya*. All are *jnyaana aananda* *svaroopaas* only. In *svaroopa*, there is no difference among all the sentients. Because the differences and multitude happens because of the sattva and other *gunaas* only. Which is absent in the *chetana*. He is not *trigunaatmaka*, he is consciousness, *jnyaana svaroopa*. Though there are many *chetanaas*, they are not like *prakruti*, where *svaroopa* itself gets modified, and it is present in different states. That is why he is called as *eka, akshara, nitya* - all are similar in *svaroopa*. 



He is *sarvavyaapee*. How is he told as *sarvavyaapee*? Because he can enter into minutest form of *prakruti* also. He is very *sookshma*. He is very subtle. This is told as anu also in *shaastraas*; but *anu* is more a material measure, which cannot be used for a spiritual entity, which is *jeevaatman*. The meaning is *sookshma*. He is so subtle that he can enter into *prakruti* in any state. He can pervade into *prakruti* also, because he is so *sookshma*. He is also *Paramaatman's amsha* only, just as *prakruti* is *Paramaatman's amsha. Amsha* means part, which means that He is *visheshana amsha. Prakruti* and *Purusha* are *shareera* of *Paramaatman*. That is why there are *visheshana amsha*, and *visheshya amsha*. 



The *laya sthaana* is told as *prakruti* here, and incidentally the *Purusha* and *Paramaatman* are going to be told. 



*Chetana* is also an *amsha* of *Paramaatman* only. 



Next, *Paramaatman svaroopa* is going to be told.

*Paramaatman* is *niravayavi*, and how can there be a part in *Paramaatman*? Can we break into parts? Where one part becomes *chetana, achetana*, etc. It is not like this. It is not *Paramaatman ekadravyatva*. It is through *shareera shareeri* *bhaava* only - the *visheshana amsha*, and *visheshya amsha*. And it is inseparably associated as attribute, both the *Purusha* and *Prakruti*. They are supported by Him, they are controlled by Him, and meant for His purpose only, all the time. They can never exist independently by themselves. Just because *amsha* is told, it does not mean that it is *dravya* only, but it is *Bhagavadaatmaka*.

Having known and meditated upon, the impeller who is *Paramaatman*, and the *jeevaatman* are different; then only he will attain Him. *Purushottama* is different, not the same as *Prakruti* and *Purusha*.

He is very different and distinct from everything else. How can we say that *jeevaatman* and *prakruti* are *amsha* of *Paramaatman? Sootrakaara* says by *shareera shareeri bhaava*, by giving different examples, *prakaasha, jaati, guna, deha. Prakaasha* is *prabhaa* and *prabhaavat, prabhaavat* is the source of light, and *prabhaa* is the light which comes out; they are different. The light spreads everywhere in brightness, whereas the source is in one place. The light is also *prakaasha*, its *prabhaa* is also *prakaasha*. Both the light and its brightness are light only, but they are different substances, the attribute moves away from it, though it is inseparably associated, and the other, the substance stays there. They are said to be parts, though they are different. Similarly, *jaati*, class. *Jaati* resides in a *vyakti*, a person. *Manushya*, *manushyatva jaati* is there in a person, like *Devadatta*. If we say that *Devadatta* is a man, then *manushyatva* is there in *Devadatta*. It is different, but is inseparably associated. *Jaati* is the attribute of the *vyakti. Guna guni* - the quality and the substance which has that quality. Similarly, *deha* and *aatman*, the body and soul. In the same way, both *prakruti* and *Purusha* are present as His *shareera*. When we say *Devadatta*, we mean *Devadatta* with the *manushyatva jaati* included, though the *jaati* is different from the person. The person itself is not *manushyatva*, and *manushyatva* is itself not the person. They are two different things, but present as person, substance and attribute. But they are told as one entity, when we say *Devadatta*, both are included. In the same with *Paramaatman*, one body, told with *amshaas*. This is the way that *Baadaraayana, Krishna Dvaipaayana* has told in the *Brahma Sootraas*. This is told as " *Amsho naanaa vyapadeshaat*". *Brahma **Sootraa* s explain how *prakruti* and *Purusha* are part of the *Paramaatman*. They are called by the name *amsha* as they are *shareera* to *Paramaatman. Shareera* does not mean having hands and legs, eyes, etc. but it is by means of the three kinds of relationship, it is *aadhaara-aadheya bhaava, niyaamaka-niyaamya **bhaava, shesha-sheshi bhaava*, these three. These are called as *shareera shareeri*. That which is *aadhaara, niyaamaka* and *sheshi*, is *shareeri*. That which is *aadheya* \(supported\), *niyaamya* \(controlled\), *shesha* \(subservient\) is called as *shareera*.

The non-sentient and sentient are both said to be *shareera* to *Paramaatman. Aatma* and *prakruti* are told to be *shareera* to *Paramaatman*. The word *aatma* shows that the varieties of *aatma* are included. There are three kinds of *aatmans, baddha, mukta, nitya*. He is different and distinct from all because all are His *shareera*.

He has to experience the fruits of the *karma, sukha, dukha*, the *phalaas* which have accrued through the *punya* and *paapa roopa karmaas* which he has done from *anaadi kaala*. He has to experience the fruits of all that. He gets a body because of *karma. Karma* is the *kaarana* for that. But, *Paramaatman's shareera* is not like that. *Prakruti* and *Purusha* are naturally *shareera* to Him. He has not got it because of *karma*. 



*Prabhaa* and *prabhaavat* are naturally associated. If the source is not there, then *prabhaa* will not be there. Similar to this, the *jagat* and *Brahman, shareera* *shareeri bhaava* is natural. It is not because of *karma*. There are many *pramaanaas* told. This is how *Paramaatma svaroopa* is explained.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Subaalopanishad* says that *avyakta* merges into *akshara*, here merging means that they stay together and cannot be differentiated that this is *avyakta*, this is *akshara*. They are merging in such a way. They are staying together, but they don't lose their essential nature. There is no *svaroopa naasha* in this *laya*. They will be in such a subtle state. That *akshara* which also has *avyakta*, goes and merges into *tamas*. It becomes a substance called *tamas. Tamas* stays in *ekee **bhaava*, the *tamas* which is a *dravya* which contains *avyakta* and *akshara*, goes and unites into *Paramaatman*, as though it is one with *Paramaatman*, cannot be differentiated. It will be in such a very very subtle state. 



The manifest and unmanifest of *Prakruti*, which have merged into the *avyakta*, moola *prakruti*, and the *Purusha*, the collectivity of all sentients, both go and unite into *Paramaatman*. This is *pralaya*.

In the *poorva kaanda* of the *Vedaas*, the *Samhitaa, Braahmana, Aranyakaas*, where *yajnya yaagaas* are all told primarily, and *Paramaatma svaroopa* is also told, but not very directly. Upanishads focus mainly on *Paramaatma svaroopa*, *aatma svaroopa*, directly and completely; this is said to be *Vedaanta. Veda* and *Vedaanta* both are known as *Vishnu*, who is none other than *Paramaatma*, Supreme Self. He is support of everything, and is Supreme Lord, Supreme Ruler, known by the name *Vishnu*. In *Vedaas*, He is known as Vishnu, and by other names also. Even *Agni, Varuna, Indra* all names stand for *Paramaatman* only in the *poorva kaanda*. This is told so in *Yaaska's Nirukta*. In *Vedaanta*, it is told by the names of *Tat, aatmaa, Brahma, aakaasha, jyoti*, used synonymously.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 The *Vaidika karmaas*, everything told in the *Ve* d *aas, yajnya, yaagaas, nitya **naimittika karmaas*, can be divided into two, as *pravrutta* and *nivrutta*. Both these *pravrutti karma* and *nivrutti karma; pravrutti karma* for *aihika* and *aamushmika* *phalaas*, fruits obtained here itself, or svarga or other kinds of fruits, various *yajnyaas, yaagaas*; and those who have the *Vedaantic* knowledge, worship *Paramaatman* only, who is inner self of everything, and this is the *nivrutti **maarga*, they are not interested in these fruits, but they want liberation, the ultimate goal. Both are told in the *Vedaas*. Both of them worship only *Vishnu*, who is having everything as His *shareera*, and is only present as everything, as the inner self of everything. He is *sarvaantaryaami*, He is only worshipped by all these. 



Because He is *Sarvamoorthi*, present as inner self of all, everything, even gods, those who worship *Indra* and other *devataas*, also worship *Vishnu* only, as He is only *Sarvamoorthi*. He is present as inner self of Indra and other *devataas*.

The *Rug, Yajur, Saama Vedaas*, whatever means they are telling, to attain various fruits, He is worshipped through those *karmaas* told in these *Vedaas*.

Those who are not interested in the fruits which are not permanent, they take up the *nivrutti maarga*, and they worship as *Jnyaanaatmaa, jnyaana svaroopa*, whose *divya mangala vigraha* is said to be *jnyaanaatmika*, one who has the *divya* *mangala vigraha* which is *jnyaanaatmika* is *Jnyaanamoorti*, is worshipped through *jnyaana yoga. Karma* which has *jnyaana yoga* as the main part, He is worshipped by that. But *nivrutti maarga* one who worships Him, he gets *moksha*.

He is *avyakta shareeraka **Paramaatman*, in the causal state. He is the *vyakta shareeraka Paramaatman*, in the state of effect. He is the *mukta* also. *Avyakta, vyakta, mukta* are all *Vishnu* *roopa* only. They are all having *Bhagavaan Vishnu* only as their inner self, and they are all the *shareera*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 What was told earlier, this is verily a statement of that only. With different qualities. The *prakruti* of *vyakta* and *avyakta* goes and merges into Him. And also *Purusha*. He is the one who is pervading everything.

One night of *Paramaatman* which is also *dviparaardha kaala*, equivalent to 100 years of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, is one day, and one night also for *Paramaatman*. One night period, they all will be united into *Paramaatman*. 



Why is it again told - *vyakta prakruti, laya* with *Purusha*? In order to tell about *nishaa*, night, which is also the same time period. At that time, the *vyakta* and *avyakta* will be united into *Paramaatman*.

This *dukha* is itself like a bright sun burning, and one who is suffering because of that heat, of the nature of the sun, which is nothing but the grief of *samsaara*. He has to take the shade of a tree which is nothing but liberation, *mukti*. There will be no *sukha* otherwise for him.

There is no happiness which is greater than *aatyantika sukha, moksha*. This is extremely pleasant - that kind of happiness he gets. He will not tolerate experience of any other *sukha* other than this *moksha sukha*. The happiness, bliss which he experiences there in moksha is so huge, that there is nothing beyond that. He cannot tolerate any other kind of happiness. Attaining this kind of *sukha* is unparalleled, and this kind of bliss, is the nature of attaining *Bhagavaan*. This bliss is never mixed with even an iota of grief there. It is beyond end, it is eternal. 



After this, *Sri Paraasharar* is going to tell the *Bhagavat shabda nirvachana*, the meaning of the *Bhagavat shabda*. The *ubhaya linga* of *Bhagavaan*. He is  [[76]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 indicating that here. This is the speciality of *Bhagavat praapti*. This is the medicine in order to get cured of the disease of *samsaara*. It is eternal and unparalleled. There is not even an iota of grief.

Because it is of unparalleled bliss, one has to put effort to attain it. One who has the *viveka*, who knows what is right and wrong, has to put effort to attain that kind of bliss. The means to attain that is said to be *jnyaana* and *karma*. 



The three kinds of *taapatraya - aadhyaatmika, aadhidaivika, aadhibhoutika*, to overcome them, He has to be attained. Attaining *Bhagavaan* only is that which destroys all these *taapaas*. Because of this, one has to put efforts to attain it. Those who say that just *vaakyaartha jnyaana* is itself moksha, this is refuted here. *Jnyaana* and *karma* are the means told here. *Karma* is not the main, in *jnyaana*, or also *jnyaana-karma samucchaya* is also not told here. Both being equal means to attain moksha, is also not true. What is told here is that *jnyaana* is only the main means, to attain *Paramaatman*, and *karma* is the *anga* to that. So, it is not without any *karma. Nitya naimittika karmaas* are all *angaas* to that. Later on, it will be told that *Brahma vidyaa* only is to be attained, through *jnyaana*, and performing *karmaas* as *anga*.

*Karma* is there as *anga* to *jnyaana. Jnyaana* is said to be of two types. From yoga, that *jnyaana* which comes through *viveka*. 



That which comes through *aagama*, which is *shabda brahma. Vivekajaa* is *Parabrahman*, the knowledge which comes out of *viveka* is *Parabrahman*. That which comes in *aagama* is *shabda brahma*. These are *shaastra janya jnyaana* and *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana. Viveka jnyaana* is *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. First, *shaastra jnyaana* is obtained by study of *shaastraas*, and then through *upaasanaa, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana* is obtained. *Shabda brahma* is that which comes from *aagama, shaastra janya jnyaana. Vivekajaa* is *upaasanaatmaka* *jnyaana*.

Both these are *Brahma vidyaa* only. The differences between these two kinds of *jnyaana* are told here. In order to refute all those who give the wrong meaning. *Ajnyaana* is before one studies the *shaastraas*, before *shaastra janya jnyaana* comes, it is ignorance. The souls are all covered by *karma*, which is also known as *avidyaa*. The knowledge is covered by *avidyaa*. Because of this, they do not know the real nature of *aatma* and *Paramaatman*. Or, they have understood it wrongly. This is opposed to *jnyaana*, and it is not *jnyaana*. This is like *andha tamas*,  [[78]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 darkness. That *jnyaana* which arises out of *shaastra shravana*, is heard through our ears, and it is *aagama janya*, and is *indriya udbhava*, as it comes through *shaastra shravana*. This is opposed to *ajnyaana*, so it is like a *deepa*. So, when we do *shaastra shravana* through an *aachaarya*, then our *ajnyaana* of *aatma* *Paramaatma yaathaatmya jnyaana* gets dispelled. So, it is said to be a *deepa*, like a light, which reveals things. It is like a light in darkness. This is *aagama janya* *jnyaana*. It also has a little bit of *anyathaa jnyaana*, and it is less only. The comparison between the sun and just a lamp, a lamp has very less brightness compared to the sun, which lights the entire world, so the light of the lamp is *alpa*. The light of lamp, can have a little bit of *anyathaa jnyaana*. The lamp dispels some amount of darkness. *Viveka janya jnyaana*, which is *upaasanaatmaka* *jnyaana*, completely dispels the ignorance and cause of ignorance, which is *avidyaa*, which is like a darkness. Compared to *aagama shaastra janya jnyaana*, it brings in a vivid perception of the Lord. That is why it is said to be like the sun. *Vivekaja* is said to be like *soorya. Aagamaja* is said to be like *deepa*, and this is *indriyodbhava*. 



This is further explained in many *shlokaas*, the two kinds of *jnyaana* as told by *Manu*, by *Mundakopanishad* - all these things are going to be taught by *Sri* *Paraasharar*. Which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 5 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is describing the *aatyantika pralaya*, which is *Moksha*, liberation. Before telling that, he tells about the various kinds of sufferings, which one goes through during birth, death, staying in the womb, in *naraka*, hell, so that one can get *virakti*. One should feel that we do not want any more of all of these, and put an end to these. And then, they seek an *aachaarya*, and adopt the means for liberation. After this, *Sri **Paraasharar* tells about the means for liberation, and also describes the *Bhagavat **svaroopa*, while describing the *upaasanaa*. 



Initially, *shaastra janya jnyaana* is to be got, by studying the *Vedaanta*, the *Upanishads* in detail, and the *Brahma Sutraas*, where one understands the meanings of the teachings of the *Upanishads*, without any contradictions and doubts. Then they can proceed to perform the means. There are two steps - \(i\) to attain the *shaastra janya jnyaana*, \(ii\) to do the *upaasanaa*, which is what leads to *Paramaatma saakshaatkaara*. These are told as *shabda brahma* and *Parabrahma*. *Shabda brahma* is *aagamamaya*, which is *shaastra janya. Parabrahma* is *vivekaja*, through *yoga, upaasanaa*. Both steps are useful. In the first step, one gets the *tattva jnyaana*, and understands the nature of the realities, and understands the means, and how to adopt the means, and what are the fruits which one gets. Then they can perform the *upaasanaa* to attain *Brahman*. However, the first step, *shaastra janya jnyaana* itself will not yield the ultimate fruit, but it will give the  [[79]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 basic knowledge required, the *jnyaana*. This also destroys some of the ignorance with respect to the knowledge of the realities; this is told as a lamp. The *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana* is told as the Sun. The lamp also dispels darkness, but there may be still some doubts, we may not be able to perceive very clearly, and it may not be very bright. And the lamp is dull compared to the Sun. The Sun dispels all the darkness and the cause of the ignorance. 



The first step is *tattva jnyaana* by listening to an *aachaarya*, which is *shravana* *janya*, by listening to the *upadesha* of *Vedaanta vaakya arthaas*. This is *shravana* *janya*, by listening to the *aachaarya*, so it is called *indriyodbhava*. 



*Vivekaja* is like the Sun, the *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*.

*Manu* has told about these things. What *Manu* has told also, I will tell you, please listen to me. *Manu* has told the messages of the *Vedaas*, the *upadesha* of the *Vedaas*. This is called as *Manu Smruti*. He is telling the means to *Moksha*, the *saadhana*. I will tell you what *Manu* has told in his *Smruti*, as the teachings of the *Upanishads*, the *Vedaas*.

*Sri Paraasharar* is telling *Manu's* words also as *pramaana. Sri Paraasharar's* words themselves are *pramaana* to us, and he is quoting *Manu*, so we can understand how valid *Manu's* words are. 



 [[80]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Kevala karma jnyaana* cannot give ultimate *purushaartha*. One who has performed *karmaas* as *anga* to *upaasanaa* is different. He will have Brahma *jnyaana*. Mere *karmaas* which are performed without *jnyaana* of *Brahman*, will only yield very meagre results, svarga and other *phalaas*. If one does not have *Brahma jnyaana*, they will do it for their own purpose, and by worshipping only the deities. They don't know that *Paramaatman* is *antaryaami* to everything, and that everything we worship is *Paramaatman's* worship only. *Paramaatman* is the one who is worshipped through all the *karmaas*; this when they do without the desire for *karma phala*, then only it can lead to liberation. 



One has to know two *Brahmas - Shabda brahma* and *Parabrahma*. Through *upaasana* only can *purushaartha* be obtained, and not by mere *karma*. This is told by *Manu* also. One who has acquired the *shaastra janya jnyaanna*, by the *Vedaanta vaakya vichaara*, without any doubt, without any contradictions, without *samshaya, viparyaya*, will be able to perform the *upaasanaa*, and get the *vivekaja jnyaana, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. He will get vivid perception of the Lord. *Viveka* is *yoga* or *upaasanaa* here.

After quoting *Manu Smruti*, *Sri Paraasharar* gives *Shruti pramaana*. In the *Mundakopanishad*, in the very beginning, *Shounaka* approaches *Aachaarya* *Angirasa*, and asks him about knowing which everything is known. *Angirasa* gives him the knowledge - " *Dve vidye veditavye - paraa cha aparaa cha*". And he says that *Aparaa vidyaa* is *Rigveda, Yajurveda, Saamaveda, Atharvaveda*, and all those things through which *tattva jnyaana* is obtained. So, *Aparaa vidyaa* is not inferior knowledge, it is foundational knowledge. *Paraa vidyaa* is about that *Akshara* *shabdita Paramaatman*, who is attained by that *vidyaa*, which is *upaasanaa*. This is told here as *Aatharvani shruti, Atharva Veda* to which *Mundakopanishad*  [[81]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 belongs. *Smrutis* are all *upabrahmanaas* of *Shruti*, and now, the *Shruti vachana* is being told. Two *vidyaas* are told in the *Aagamaas*. The *Paraa* is *vivekajanya*, that *upaasanaa, yoga* through which *Brahman* is attained. *Parabrahman* is told as *Akshara* here. 



Those who say that mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* is sufficient for attaining *moksha*, they are put aside here. Mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* alone is not sufficient. That is only *aparaa vidyaa*, foundational knowledge, and one has to start with that only. After that, one has to perform *upaasanaa*, in order to attain *Parabrahman*. *Poorva meemaamsakaas* say *karma* alone, and they don't believe in *upaasanaa*, and even *Upanishads* are *arthavaada* for them; that is all refuted here. Those who say that *Parabrahman* can be obtained by mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana*, it is said clearly that this is not possible in the *shaastraas*; because by mere *vaakyaartha* *jnyaana* if one can attain, here itself one should not feel any sorrow or suffering; because anyone can get *vaakyaartha jnyaana* and attain *moksha*. This is against the *Brahma Sutras*. This is also against the *Pratyaksha*, because we can see that so many people study the *vaakyaarthaas*, but all their sufferings are still continuing. *Manu vachana* is most trustworthy, as he was an expert in *Vedaas, **Vedaarthaas*. *Sri Paraasharar* is telling that this is *pramaana*; and *aagama* and *viveka* mean *shaastra janya jnyaana* and *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*, respectively.

This is also taken from the *Mundakopanishad* *shruti*. This is the *svaroopa* of *Akshara*, one who is attained through *Paravidyaa*. When we split the words, it becomes *Paraa* and *vidyaa*, when we *combine*, it becomes *Paravidyaa*. One who is the object of meditation, through *Paravidyaa*, the ultimate goal who is attained, that *Brahman's svaroopa* is told here. *Avyakta* means that He can be known only through *Shrutis*. None of the other *pramaanaas* can help us to know *Brahman*. *Pratyaksha*, and *Anumaana* are not *pramaanaas* for knowing Brahman.  [[82]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Baadaraayanar* established in the *Brahma Sutraas* that " *Shaastrayonitvaat*", that " *Shaastraika samadhigamyatvam*", this is told as *Avyakta* here. It is only through Shruti that one can know the *Parabrahma svaroopa*. * *



*Achintyam* means that He is beyond thought, that one cannot think of His *svaroopa* completely. One cannot even think or imagine completely. One has to do *chintane*, but cannot do it fully. *Ajaram* and *Ajam* tell about the *vikaara* *raahitya* of *Brahman*, the absence of six-fold modifications which happen to every object, substance, being. The six-fold modifications are *asti, jaayate, vardhate*, *viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati* - the *shat bhaava vikaaraas*. These *vikaaraas* are not there for Brahman. 



Speech and mind cannot perceive fully the nature of *Brahman*, or the qualities or attributes of *Brahman. Avyaya* means that He is without any *vyaya*, He is *vikaara* *rahita. Achintyam* and *anirdeshyam* are telling about *vaang-manasaa*-*agocharatvam; achintyam* is through mind, and *anirdeshyam* is through *vaak*. 



Aroopa means that He does not have *karma kruta shareera* like *deva, manushya*. Or, He has a divine auspicious form, *divya mangala vigraha*, which is *nitya*, eternal. This is called *shubhaashraya. Aroopa* means absence of *deva, manushya* *roopa* which come through *karma*. 



He does not have *paani, paada* \(hands and legs\), which are *praakruta*, as we perceive here.

He is all pervading, He is everywhere. He can move anywhere, He is eternal. He is the cause of the whole world. He does not have a cause. He is existing by Himself. 



He pervades everything. *Vibhutva* can also be told as controllership, *niyantrutva*. He does not have a cause Himself. He is eternally present by Himself. Whatever is  [[83]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 present in this world, in pervaded form, all this is Him only. He is the cause of a *jeeva* to get connected, to get association with a body. 



From whom this whole world consisting of pervaded and pervading, is created. By Him, *Akshara*. There are many attributes told for *Brahman, vibhu, sarvagata*, *nitya, bhootayoni, akaarana, vyaapya vyaaptam yatah*. The *nitya sooris*, who are eternally present, in the *Paramapada*, they always see Him. He is seeable, He is not *adrushya*. He cannot be seen like the *praakruta* objects. 



All these clearly establish that the object of *Paravidyaa*, who is *Akshara*, who has all these attributes, is *saguna* and that this *Paravidyaa* is not about *nirguna* *Brahman*, but about *saguna Brahman*. Those who say that *Paravidyaa* is about *nirguna Brahman* are refuted here. It is about *saguna Brahman* only. This is very clear here.

That which is very subtle, and who is *tejomaya*, is to be meditated upon, by those who are desirous of *Moksha*. 



*Paramapada* has three meanings, told by *Bhagavad Ramanuja* in *Vedaarthasangraha*, and other works - \(i\) *Paramapada* means *Parabrahman* Himself, because *padyate* is *gamyate*, one who is attained, \(ii\) *Paramapada* is the place where *Paravaasudeva* is there all the time, which is *Vaikuntha*, this is also told in the *Shrutis*, \(iii\) *Jeevaatma svaroopa* is also told as *Paramapada*. The one who is meditated upon by those who desire Him is *Parabrahman* only.

The *nirvachana* of *Bhagavaan shabda* is going to be told here. The *Parabrahman* who is qualified by all these wonderful attributes, *saguna Brahman*, is the one who is known by the word *Bhagavaan*. This word denotes *Parabrahman* only. He is the essence of all the *Vedaanta*, and *Sri Engal Aalwaan* quotes many *pramaanaas. Sarvavyaapi* is *Bhagavaan, Naaraayana* is *Bhagavaan, Vaasudeva* is *Bhagavaan*. One should offer self as *havis* by reciting *pranava*. Those who meditate with the *mantra dvaadashaakshara*, is what is told here, the *mantra* *vishesha* meaning. *Om namo bhagavate vaasudevaaya*, is the *dvaadashaakshara* *mantra*. 



The word *tadeva*, is very clearly stressing on the meaning, that the *Bhagavat* *shabda vaachya*, the one who is denoted by the word *Bhagavaan*, is none other than *Parabrahman*, who is the one who can be attained through *Paravidyaa*, and who is the cause of all the worlds, the *jagat kaarana*, and who has the *ubhaya* *linga, sakala heya pratyaneekatva*, and *kalyaana gunaatmakatva*. He is opposed to everything which is defiling, and He is abode to innumerable auspicious qualities. 



*Manu's* words are also quoted here by *Sri Engal Aalwaan*. One who is known by the word *Bhagavaan* is none other than the sole cause of the entire universe. The *Bhagavat shabda* is capable of denoting the complete meaning, *svaroopa, guna*, *vibhava* of *Paramaatman* who is *ananta*, all pervading. The word *Bhagavaan* is capable of denoting the complete *yaathaatmya*, complete real nature of *Parabrahman*.

Thus, the *jnyaana* by means of which the nature of *Brahman* which was so far taught is known 'as is', is told as *parajnyaana*. The other is merely *trayeemaya* - *Vedic* knowledge, or *shaastra janya jnyaana*. 



Thus, what was told as the meaning of *Bhagavat shabda* as *bhootayonitva* \(cause of all beings\) and others, that Brahman's tattva or *Svaroopa* is known by means of which *jnyaana* 'as is' \(directly perceived\), that *jnyaana* which leads to vivid perception of the Lord, is *Parajnyaana*. The other which is indirectly the means is told as *aparajnyaana*. 



The meanings of *Paravidyaa* and *Aparavidyaa* are concluded here.

*Bhagavat shabda* is used in the primary sense in the entire universe, only for denoting *Paramaatman*, who is the cause of this entire universe. In other places, it is only in the secondary sense, as told here, with respect to a *mukta*. For a *mukta*, the bondage of karma is destroyed. So *mukta* is not known by *deva*, *manushya*, and He is *ashabda gochara*. He is not denoted by the words *deva*, *manushya*, etc. The liberated self attains similarity to *Brahman* in *moksha*, and that is why he is told as *Brahma* itself, that he is similar to *Brahman*, he will have  [[86]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Brahma gunaas*. He is told in *poojyaartha*, in the secondary sense. This *shloka* does not explain the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan* can be known very clearly. *Bhagavaan* is told only with respect to *Paramaatman* in the primary sense. When it is used in the sense of respect, *Poojyaartha*, it is applicable to others, in the secondary sense, as used for *mukta* here.

He is the cause of all the causes in this universe. He is opposed to anything that is defiling. He has all the *aishwarya* so told as *mahaavibhooti*. For *Parabrahman*, the cause of everything who is without any blemish, the *Bhagavat shabda* is used in the primary sense.

Now, the *Bhagavat shabda nirvachana* is going to be done - *bha, ga*, the letters are going to be explained. To establish the *Bhagavat shabda* clearly that this  [[87]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 applies only to *Parabrahman* in the primary sense, the derivation of the word *Bhagavaan* and the meanings of each letter are explained very clearly here now. *Sambharana* is making the *prakruti* capable of modifying into its various effects. *Prakruti* becomes *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc. by mere willing of the *Paramaatman*. *Paramaatman* makes some part of *prakruti* into *sattva, rajas, tamas*, into imbalance. *Bhartaa* means *swami*, the Lord of everything. 



*Bhakaara* has two meanings - *sambhartaa* and *bhartaa*. Neta means one who protects, *goptaa. Sambhartaa* means that He makes everything go and reach Him. In dissolution, He does *samhaara*, He takes back everything so that everything comes and merges unto Him, as though it is one. He is the one who makes everything come and merge into Him, so that there is no name and form differentiation. 



*Gakaara* is both *gupti artha* and *gati artha*. Even *jnyaana artha* can be told. In this sense, He willed that to become many, and created everything. He Himself became everything. The *Ekaayana Shruti* is told here - *Bha* has two meanings - *bhartaa* and *sambhartaa*. One who has all these qualities is only *Bhagavaan*, and He is only none other than *Parambrahma, Sriman Naaraayana*. The *Atharva* *shiras pramaana* is also told here. 



All these clearly establish the meaning of *Bhagavaan* as the meanings of the letters *bha, ga*.

The meaning of *'bhaga' * in *Bhagavaan* is also told like this. He is everywhere. The word *samagra* is to be added everywhere. *Samagrasya aishwaryasya, **samagrasya veeryasya, samagrasya yashasah, samagra shriyah*. The six qualities are told for *Bhagavaan - aishwarya, veerya, yashas, shree, jnyaana, vairaagya*. All these six qualities put together is called as *Bhaga*. One who has this *Bhaga* is *Bhagavaan*.

The meaning of *'va' * is told in this *shloka. Bhootaatmani* means one who has all the beings as His *shareera*. All beings reside in Him, who has everything as His *shareera*. One who is the inner self of everything, in Him, all the beings reside, supported by Him. He is *jagat aadhaara*. He is the support of the whole world. Everything is residing in Him. He lives in all the beings as *antaraatman*, as the inner self, as He has done *anupravesha*. Everything has Him as its self. All these have *Paramaatman* as their inner self, and that is what is true. The meaning of *vakaara* is told here.

The great word - the wonderful word, *Bhagavaan*, told here, denotes none other than *Parabrahma bhoota, Vaasudeva*. It cannot denote anyone else. By the meaning of the word *Bhagavaan*, we can know that He is none other than *Vaasudeva*. This is also the *nirvachana* of *Vaasudeva*, that He *sarvatra vasati*, He lives everywhere. So, *Bhagavat shabda* denotes none other than *Vaasudeva*.

Though it is used in *poojya artha* in the *loka*, in *Nighantu*, and others, where others are also told as *Bhagavaan Baadaraayana*, etc., even there it denotes *Paramaatman* only, *Bhagavaan Naaraayana*, *Vishnu* only, in the primary sense. With respect to *Bhagavaan* in the primary sense, and in other places in the secondary sense. He is the *sarva kaarana*, He is *sarva guna paripoorna*, He is *parama poojya*. So, denoting Him is not in *upachaara*. With respect to any other *jeevaatman*, if it is told, it is only to highlight some quality which is a very minutest part of the *Paramaatman*, it is only *oupachaarika, amukhya*, in the secondary sense. In other places, if the *Bhagavaan shabda* is told, it is only that they have some special knowledge, compared to others.

The *shaadgunya* of *Bhagavaan - jnyaana, shakti, bala, aishwarya, veerya, tejas*. All other *gunaas* are *antarbhoota*, included in this itself, like *satyakaamatva*, *satyasankalpatva*; they are all *vistaara* of these qualities themselves. *Sattva* and other *gunaas* which are opposed, *vyatireka visheshanaas*, here the *nakaara* *vaachyakatva* is told. The *gunaas* of *prakruti, sattva, rajas, tamas* are not there in *Bhagavaan*; their effects such as *klesha, karma*, are included here. *Jnyaana*, *shakti, bala, aishwarya, veerya, tejas*, are those included in *sakala kalyaana* *gunaakaratva*.

The meaning of *pranava* was told earlier, where the division into *Veda shaakhaas* by *Vyaasa* was told.

All other *kalyaana gunaas* like *satyakaamatva, satyasankalpatva*, *sarvajnyatva*, are all included here. That which applies to Him, the other qualities, attributes of *Bhagavaan*, are all included in all these, they are all the *vistaaraas* of these *gunaas* only. All the *heya gunaas*, the *praakruta gunaas* of *sattva, rajas*, *tamas*, the letter *na* indicates that He does not have any of the *heya gunaas*. The other *gunaas* are the expansion of the different modes of these qualities only. *Na* *kaara* indicates *akhila heya pratyaneekatva*. The *trigunaas, sattva, rajas, tamas*, and the effects of these like *klesha*, are not there. It is very clear that the *ubhaya* *linga* of *Bhagavaan*, which is told as *akhilaheyapratyaneekatva* and *sakala* *kalyaana gunaakaratva*, we have to *anusandhaana* of these in the name *Bhagavaan*. Thus the *dvaadashaakshara*, the *Vaasudeva dvaadashaaksharee*, the *Bhagavat shabda* is told with this mantra. The *dvaadashaakshara* is the means to attain *Bhagavaan* as an accessory to *Brahma vidyaa*. The meaning of the *Bhagavat shabda* in this *Vaasudeva dvaadashaakshara mantra* is explained thus. 



With this, the *nirvachana* of *Bhagavat shabda* is concluded. 



We are studying Chapter 5 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is telling about the *Paramaatma svaroopa*, and the *nirvachana* of *Bhagavat shabda*. The word *Bhagavaan* is used in the primary sense with respect to only *Vishnu*, and wherever it is used with respect to others, it is only *oupachaarika*, in the *poojya*  [[91]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *artha*. Even in *poojya artha*, in the primary sense it has to be *Bhagavaan* only. Whereas for others, it is only *oupachaarika*. 



Another meaning of *Bhagavaan* is One who knows the creation, sustenance, and dissolution, which is happening for all the beings - where they come from, where they go to, One who knows all these things, and *vidyaa, avidyaa*, He only can be told as *Bhagavaan*. Only *Vishnu*, being the *Jagadekakaarana*. *Shruti* also tells very clearly in the *Naasadeeya Sookta*. If anyone knows, it will be only *Vishnu*. Nobody else knows. 



Now, *Bhagavaan's guna paripoornatva, shaadgunya, akhilaheyapratyaneekatva*, is being told.

The name *Vaasudeva* indicates that all the beings reside in Him, and He also resides in all the beings as *antaryaami*. He is the support, and they are all supported by Him. Everything is *shareera bhoota* to Him. This is told as the *nirvachana* of the *Vaasudeva shabda. Bhootaas* means the *jeevaas*. In the *Udyoga* *parvan* of *Mahaabhaarata*, it is said that He has all the *aishvarya*, and this is how He is to be known. He is the *jyoti svaroopa*, and is also the cause of creation, as told in *Mokshadharma*. There are two meanings given here - one is that He is *jyoti* *svaroopa*, and the other that He is the cause of creation. *Divu kreedaayaam*, says that *srushti*, etc. are His *kreedaa* only. In the *Ekaayana smruti* also it is told like this. *Vaasuscha asou devashcha* is *Vaasudeva*.

*Sri Paraasharar* is telling what *Keshidhvaja* taught *Khaandikya Janaka*. This story is going to follow in the next chapter. *Khaandikya Janaka* asked *Keshidhvaja* to teach him about the *Bhagavat svaroopa*. The meaning of the name *Bhagavaan*, who is *Ananta, Vaasudeva*. This is explained to him. This *Janaka* is a grandson of *Janaka Mahaaraaja*. They were all *Brahmavits* and *Brahmanishthaas*. They were all great, knowledgeable wise people.

He lives in all the beings as the *antaryaami*, this is also told in the *Antaryaami* *Braahmana*. All the beings are supported by Him only. They reside in Him, they cannot exist independently. Their *svaroopa* cannot exist without Paramaatman. They are ever associated with Him, through *apruthaksiddhi sambandha*. He is the one who creates, and He is the Lord of all the worlds. This is the meaning of deva.

These *shlokaas* are very well known. These are also commented upon by *Bhaashyakaarar* in *Sribhaashya* and other works. What was explained so far is the meaning of the *dvaadashaakshara*, and in this the *Bhagavat shabda*. The *nirvachana* of this was told so far. For the two *vidyaas - Paraa vidyaa* and *Aparaa* *vidyaa*, this is the *vishaya* for both. The meanings told here is such that it remains firmly in our mind. This is only explained further by four *shlokaas*. He is *avyakta*, the *moola prakruti, moola kaarana*. The effects of this moola *prakruti*, are *mahat*, *ahamkaara. Gunaas*, qualities of *prakruti* are *sattva, rajas, tamas*. Aadi means *dukha, ajnyaana*, etc. which are the effect of *prakruti*. He is beyond all that, different and distinct from all that, beyond all that. For *baddha jeevaas, prakruti* *sambandha* comes because of the *karmaas*, in order or experience the fruits of *punya* and *paapa karmaas*, they get associated with *prakruti*. This is not there for *Bhagavaan*, He is the *karmaadhyaksha*. It is clear that *Bhagavaan* is different and distinct from the matter, and also the *jeevaatman* who is associated with this matter. 



In *samsaara dashaa, mukta* was once upon a time a bound self only, then he got liberated and became a *mukta*. At that time, when he was in *samsaara*, he was covered by *avidyaa*, etc., so he had *jnyaana sankocha*. This makes *Bhagavaan* different and distinct from a *mukta*. There is no *jnyaana sankocha* for *Bhagavaan* at any time at all. He is inner self of all, and is different and distinct from *nitya* also. He is the one who controls everything. 



Even *nityaas*, though they are never associated with *samsaara* at any time, they are supported and reside in *Paramaatman* only. They are controlled by *Paramaatman*, and are also *shareera* of *Paramaatman*. They are *nityaas* because of *Bhagavaan's sankalpa* only. 



He is pervading inside and outside, all over. This is told as *aattam*. That which is inside the *prakruti mandala*, all the objects, are all pervaded by *Bhagavaan*, inside and outside, completely.

He has all the divine auspicious qualities. This is His nature itself. By the minutest part of His *sankalpa* itself, He has pervaded everything. He is supporting them, He is doing the *dhaarana*, by the very minute part of His *sankalpa*. He is pervading all the beings inside and outside, by the minutest part of His *shakti*. All His *avataaraas*, whatever body He takes, are taken by His own will. It is suitable to Him. He takes such a body. His *deha* is *poojya*, most worshippable, divine auspicious form. During His *avataara*, He takes by His own will. His *avataaraas* are most beneficial to the world. By His *avataaraas*, He also shows what is the form of the Lord to be meditated upon, otherwise we will never come to know about how to meditate the Lord. For this, He has to come Himself and reveal Himself. He reveals as *Vibhavaavataara, Archaavataara*, so that we know the form of the *Bhagavaan* to meditate upon. He reveals His form for us to do *aaraadhanaa*, *poojaa*, etc., for doing *jagat hita*, for doing good to the whole world. Out of His own will He takes *avataara*. Whatever He wants to accomplish in those *avataaraas*, whatever is good to the world, He takes that form.

He is the *raashi*, He has got innumerable *ananta kalyaana gunaas, shaadgunya* and other *kalyaana gunaas, teja, bala, aishwarya, jnyaana, veerya, shakti*, He is an abode to only innumerable auspicious *kalyaana gunaas*. It is told clearly what is not there, the meaning of the *nakaara, klesha, \(avidyaa, asmita*, etc.\), *karma*, *vipaaka, aashaya \(vaasanaa\), * which are told in the *Yoga sootraas* are not there in Him. He is away from any defect. It is not that He had some defect and it got removed, but His nature is totally opposed to anything which is defiling. Just like light and darkness. Light cannot tolerate any darkness. He does not have any of the *heya gunaas*. He is *paraanaam parah*. Even *Brahma* and other gods, He is Supreme to them also. He is the ruler of *para* and *avara*, the *devaas* and *manushyaas*. He is the Lord of both.

He is the Lord of all, *Eeshvara*, the Supreme Ruler. He has these forms - *Vyooha*, *Vibhava*. His *Vaasudeva para roopa* is *avyakta*, cannot be seen - this is *avyakta*. The *Vibhava*, and Archaa roopa are all seen here - these are *vyakta*. These can be told as *Vyashti* \(differentiated\), *Samashti* \(collective\) *roopa*. *Para roopa* is *avyakta*. The *Vyooha* and other forms are revealed. He is *avyakta svaroopa* and *prakata svaroopa* also. With all these, in any form, He is *sarveshvara* only, Supreme Lord. He does not have anyone who is superior to Him. He is not under the control of anyone else. He has *sarvajnyatva*, He sees everything. *Sri* *Aalavandaar* says " *yugapat sarvam pratyakshena sadaa svatah*", as told by *Sri* *Naathamuni* himself. *Sarvajnya* means that He knows everything. *Sarvavit* means that He knows the *prakaaraas* of everything. He can know directly. He does not need any *indriyaas*, and other means. He can also know through *indriyaas* if He wants. These are all *apraakruta* only for Him. Or, this is all for His benefit only. He is superior to all the powers. All *shaktis* are residing in Him.

The *para vidyaa, paraa yayaa tadaksharam abhigamyate*, which was told, is being concluded here. There is another *paatha, sa jnyaayate yena*. This *sah* means *Purushottama* only. This is told - *jnyaatum drashtum cha tattvena praveshtum cha **parantap* a, as told in the *Bhagavad Geeta*. Three things are told here - *Parabhakti*, *Parajnyaana, Paramabhakti. Bhagavatpraapti* only is the cure for *taapatrayaas*. Only then, one can attain moksha, eternal communion with *Bhagavaan*. First comes *jnyaana, aagamottha jnyaana, vaakya janya jnyaana, **shruti, shaastra janya jnyaana*, He is known through this. Through *upaasanaa*, *darshana samaanaakaaratva*, He is attained, He is seen. The *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan* is told, *ubhaya lingatva*, He has no defects, etc. He is known through *vivekaja jnyaana, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. He is attained through *darshana* *samaanaakaara, bhakti roopaapanna, upaasanaa, dhruvaa anusmruti, **tailadhaaraavat avicchinna smruti santati roopaa*, and then only can one attain *Bhagavaan*. The *phala* also will be similar to that. All of this is told as *jnyaana*. From *shaastra janya jnyaana*, *tattva jnyaana* comes, then through *vivekaja* *jnaana*, one can see; when this becomes *darshana samaanaakaara*, and *bhakti* *roopaapanna* also, then *Bhagavaan* is attained. This is actually *jnyaana*, the real knowledge. Everything else other than that is said to be *ajnyaana* with respect to that. Anything other than *Bhagavat vishaya*, that which is opposed to *Bhagavaan*, is all *bandhaka, avidyaa roopa*. That which gets *svaroopa vikaara* itself, the *achit*, He is different and distinct from that. He is different and distinct from *prakruti* *samsrushta chetana, baddha chetana*. He is always *shuddha*, not like *muktaas*, who were at one time associated with *prakruti*, and were *ashuddha. Bhagavaan* is different and distinct from *muktaas*, this is shown by *nirmala. Ekaroopam* shows that He is different and distinct from *nitya sooris* also; based on *Bhagavaan's* *sankalpa*, they can take many forms. Where is this told, means that this is told in the *Shrutis*. It is told in the *Shrutis* that there is no other way. We have to do *upaasanaa* on Him, it has to be *darshana samaanaakaara roopaapanna*. 



Whatever *Keshidhvaja* taught to *Khaandikya Janaka*, that *Sri Paraasharar* is telling here, the *Bhagavat svaroopa*. 



This completes Chapter Five.

*Sri Paraasharar* - The *Bhagavat svaroopa* which is the object of meditation, *upaasanaa, upaasya*, was told. Now, the *upaasanaa* itself is told, with all the *angaas, upaangaas*, accessories and other things. *Svaadhyaaya* is told as the study of all the *Veda vaakyaas*, along with the *meemamsaa*, the *vichaara roopa* *meemaamsaa shaastra*, so that there is no *samshaya, viparyaya*; those *vaakyaas* which are directly telling about the *tattvaas*, the *Bhagavat svaroopa*, etc., the *Vedaanta vaakyaas* which are teaching *tattva*, the *dvaadashaakshara, pranava*, and others which teach about the *svaroopa* of *Paramaatman*, along with *meemaamsaa, poorva meemaamsaa* and *uttara meemaamsaa* is told here. This is told by the *svaadhyaaya shabda* here. *Sah* means *Purushottama*, with all the *shaadgunyaas*, the *vibhooti*, the *divya mangala vigraha*. One who has all these, the *Purushottama* is being told here by *sah*. The knowledge which arises out of *svaadhyaaya samyama*, is nothing but Brahman only. The topic, subject matter of this *svaadhyaaya* is *Brahman* only. So, it can be told as Brahman itself. This is the cause of attaining *Paramaatman*. Not only does this help to get a vivid perception of the Lord, but also one can attain Him with this.

*Meemaamsaa shravana* is extremely important because once one does the *svaadhyaaya samskaara*, as *Vedaadhyayana* is only *akshara raashi grahana*, where meanings are known *aapaatatah*, whereas one has to understand the meanings without any doubt, without any contradictions, without *samshaya*, *viparyaya*, and these doubts will be completely destroyed through *meemaamsaa*. So *meemaamsaa shravana* is a must. Having studies the *Vedaas*, the *Poorva* *kaanda*, then *Poorva meemaamsaa* is to be studied. And then the *Uttara kaanda*, and the *Uttara meemaamsaa*, where one comes to know that there is *niratishaya* *phala praapti*, that *Parama purushaartha* can be attained. Therefore, *Uttara* *meemaamsaa adhyayana* is also to be done. One has to know clearly the meanings, what is required, what is important, and then one has to do meditation, *upaasanaa*. When one is engaged in *upaasanaa*, because of association with *prakruti*, where *sattva, rajas, tamas* have their effects, the mind can get disturbed. Such *upaasanaa* should not get disturbed, or should not become faulty. In order to avoid that, again, *svaadhyaaya* is to be done. *Svaadhyaaya, upaasanaa, svaadhyaaya, upaasanaa*, like this, one has to do. *Sri* *Engal Aalwaan* gives an example here. A child sees the *aksharaas*, and then he will write himself, and practice so that he can understand. Again he will refer to the book, and then again he will write. This is the way he learns. The *Saankhya* and other *darshanaas* by *Kapila Maharshi*, those who follow that, they resort to yoga only, and don't do *svaadhyaaya* and *yoga* both, they say that *pradhaana* is the *jagat kaarana; Vaisheshikaas* say that *paramaanu* is the *jagat kaarana*, and they don't accept *Eeshvara*. Those which are against the Shruti, are seen in the other *darshanaas*, as they resort to only yoga. Their meditation of knowledge is because they don't accept Brahman, it is *kevala yoga*, without *Paramaatman*. Whereas *Vedaanta*, those who are *Vedaantis*, those who follow the *Vedaanta* properly, they understand that for the entire world, Brahman is the creator, and  [[99]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 everything is *Brahmaatmaka*. That He is *antaryaami* in everything, He has done *anupravesha*, and done *naama roopa vyaakarana*, so everything is *Brahmaatmaka*. This *Brahmaatmaka naanaatva* is *shruti siddha*. Whereas *Brahmaatmaka* and *Abrahmaatmaka naanaatva* is *shruti nishiddha*. Everything is *Brahmaatmaka* and *Brahman* only is *jagat kaarana*. Those who follow the *shrutis*, they are able to follow it properly like this. When this becomes mature, when this fructifies, there will be a vivid perception of the Lord.

In order to see the *Paramaatman, svaadhyaaya* is also an eye. *Yoga* is said to be the *parama chakshu*, the *pradhaana chakshu*. Through *upaasanaa* only, the *saakshaatkaara* of *Paramaatman* happens. *Svaadhyaaya* is also an eye, means that it also helps us to understand the nature of *Paramaatman*. Through *upaasanaa*, one can have vivid perception of the Lord Himself. This is said to be the Supreme eye. He cannot be seen with our *maamsa chakshus*, the *praakruta* *chakshus*, material eyes.

In the meantime, *Keshidhvaja* did many many *yaagaas. Svaadhyaaya* is said to be an accessory to *upaasanaa*. Now, *yajnya* and others are also told as accessory to *upaasanaa. Braamhanaah vividishanti yajnyena daanena tapasaa ... Keshidhvaja* had *aatma jnyaana*, being a *brahmopaasana nishtha*, he performed many *yajnaas* as an accessory to that *brahmopaasana*. Why did he do all the *yajnya* and other *karmaas*? *Karma* is required to get rid of *praacheena karma* which is obstructing the rising of knowledge through *upaasanaa. Praacheena karma* which is opposed to *para vidyaa utpatti* is called *mrutyu* here. To start the *upaasanaa*, he has to get rid of the obstruction first. Through *karmaas*, he got rid of the *praacheena* *karmaas* which are obstructing the start of *upaasanaa*.

The story continues. This is a wonderful story highlighting the greatness of *Brahma vidyaa*. We will next see the rest of the story. 



We are studying Chapter 6 of *Amsha* 6. When *Maitreyar* asks *Paraasharar* to teach about the *pralayaas*, when telling about *aatyantika pralaya*, he tells about all the grief that a *jeevaatman* undergoes, and then tells about the *Bhagavat **svaroopa*. Now, he tells about what *Keshidhvaja* who was a *Brahmavit*, taught *Khaandikya Janaka*. They were both grandsons of another Janaka by name *Dharmadhvaja*. They both fight, and *Keshidhvaja* wins over the war, and *Khaandikya Janaka* goes and vanishes into the forest. *Khaandikya Janaka* is a great expert in *Karma kaanda*, and *Keshidhvaja* in *Adhyaatma shaastra*. *Keshidhvaja* is performing many *yaagaas*, while he is also doing *upaasanaa*; once while performing *pravargya yaaga*, he will have a cow from which the *havis* is collected for the *yaaga*. A tiger kills that cow, and for that, the *ritwiks* say that he has to do a *praayaschitta*, without which the *yaaga* will not be complete. *Keshidhvaja* goes and asks many sages, *Kasheru, Shunaka*, and others; none of them know the *praayaschitta* for this; and they all point him to *Khaandikya* *Janaka*, who is an expert, and only he can tell what is the *praayaschitta*. *Keshidhvaja* then decides that he will approach *Khaandikya Janaka*, in the forest, and requests him to tell the *praayaschitta* for this. Being his enemy, in case he kills him, even then he will get the fruits of the *yajnya*. If he, by chance tells him  [[104]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 what is the *praayaschitta*, then he can come and complete his *yaaga* by doing the *praayaschitta*. And then, he would have completed the *yaaga*.

Having told this, he asked what was the *praayaschitta* for this.

*Khaandikya Janaka* being an expert in *karmakaanda*, told him properly as it is, as told in the *shaastraas*, the complete *praayaschitta* for this, what is ordained as *praayaschitta*. 



Whatever is told in the *Vaajasaneya Samhitaa*, he told, that *praayaschitta* is known as *Sprunomi Homa*. It is told in the *Vaajasaneya shaakhaa*, by *Keshigruhapati*, about how the tiger killed the cow, and about how he has to do certain *homaas* as *praayaschitta*, with the specific *mantraas*. They can select another cow, and continue the *yaaga*, is told by *Aapastamba* also.

*

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 As told in the *Veda vidhis*, he completed all the *yaaga*, and did the final ritual, the *avabhruta snaana*. Having done what was ordained to be done, he started to think thus - 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 37: *****पूस्जताश्च * *****द्ववजाथसवे * *****सिथया * *****मातनता * *****मया * | *****तथैवागथगजनोऽप्यथषयोस्जतोऽमभमतैमगया * *****॥ * *****३७ * *****॥ * ***All the *Brahmins* were properly worshipped by me. All the people who had come to attend the *yaaga*, were all given proper *dakshinaas* and other things. They were treated well. In the same way, whoever was wanting donation, I have given all of that. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 38: *****यथाहगमथय * *****लोकथय * *****मया * *****सवं * *****ववचेस्ष्ितम् * | *****अतनष्पन्नक्रक्रयं * *****चेतथतथावप * *****मम * *****क्रकं * *****यथा * *****॥ * *****३८ * *****॥ *

Whatever is possible for this world, I have done everything as per that. Even in this case, though I have treated everyone properly, given proper *dakshinaas*, and worshipped all the *Brahmins*, done whatever is to be done, treated everyone well, given all the donations, even then my mind says that something is still left out, missing. He starts thinking about what he has left out. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 39: *****इत्थं * *****चांगचन्तयन्नेव * *****सथमार * *****स * *****महीपततः * | *****खास्ण्डक्याय * *****न * *****ित्तेतत * *****मया * *****वै * *****र्ुरुिक्षिणा * *****॥ * *****३९ * *****॥ * ***When he was thinking about what he has left out, at that time, he remembered immediately that he had not given the *gurudakshinaa* for *Khaandikya Janaka*, who had told him the *praayaschitta* for the cow being killed. He had still to give the *gurudakshinaa*, and that's why he was worried.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Immediately, again, he got into a chariot, and went into the deep forest where *Khaandikya Janaka* was living. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 41: *****खास्ण्डक्यो * *****अवप * *****पुनदृगष््वा * *****तमायान्तं * *****र्ृतायुर्ः * | *****तथथौ * *****हन्तुं * *****कृतमततः * *****तमाह * *****स * *****पुननृगपः * *****॥ * *****४१ * *****॥ * ***When *Khaandikya* saw him coming again, he immediately took his weapons, and got ready to kill him. He had decided that he is going to kill *Keshidhvaja*.

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****भो * *****इतत * | *****तनष्क्रय * *****िक्षिणा * | *****तनस्ष्क्रय * *****इतत * *****च * *****पाठः * | ***



O *Khaandikya*, I have not come to hurt you in any way. Don't get angry. I have come here in order to give *gurudakshinaa*. Please know that I have come here to offer you *gurudakshinaa*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 43: *****तनष्पादितो * *****मया * *****यार्ः * *****सम्यक् * *****त्विुपिेशतः * | *****सो * *****अहं * *****ते * *****िातुमेच्छामम * *****वृणीष्व * *****र्ुरुिक्षिणाम् * *****॥ * *****४३ * *****॥ * ***With your *upadesha*, whatever you told, the *praayaschitta* for the problem that I had, I have completed all the *yaagaas* in a proper way, as told in the *vidhis*, and now, I am wanting to give you the *gurudakshinaa*. Please tell me what is the *gurudakshinaa* that you want. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 44: *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****भूयः * *****स * *****मस्न्त्रमभः * *****सार्ं * *****मन्त्रयामास * *****पागथगवः * | *****र्ुरुतनस्ष्क्रयकामो * *****अयं * *****क्रकं * *****मया * *****प्राथ्यगताममतत * *****॥ * *****४४ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - Again, *Khaandikya Janaka* gathered all his ministers, and started to discuss with them, and wanted to know what is in their mind. He said that *Keshidhvaja* has come in order to give *gurudakshinaa*, what is it that I am supposed to ask him? 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 45: *** [[110]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 **तमूचुमगस्न्त्रणो * *****राज्यम् * *****अशेषं * *****प्राथ्यगतामयम् * | *****शत्रुमभः * *****प्राथ्यगते * *****राज्यमनायामसतसैतनकैः * *****॥ * *****४५ * *****॥ * ***They all suggested that he should ask for the kingdom, as *gurudakshinaa*. With enemies, that is what is asked always, without waging any war, and without any killing, he would get the entire kingdom. They told him that he had to ask the kingdom. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 46: *****प्रहथय * *****तानाह * *****नृपः * *****स * *****खास्ण्डक्यो * *****महामततः * | *****थवल्पकालम् * *****महीपाल्यं * *****मादृशैः * *****प्राथ्यगते * *****कथम् * *****॥ * *****४६ * *****॥ * ***Immediately, *Khaandikya Janaka* laughed and said "How can I ask for the kingdom, which is impermanent? How long will I do the ruling over this kingdom? How can a person like me ask for that kind of a meagre fruit?" 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 47: *****एवमेतत् * *****भवन्तो * *****अत्र * *****ह्यथगसार्नमस्न्त्रणः * | *****परमाथगः * *****कथं * *****को * *****अत्र * *****यूयं * *****नात्र * *****ववचिणाः * *****॥ * *****४७ * *****॥ *

All of you ministers are only interested in wealth, and you do not know what is *paramaartha*. You do not have the knowledge about what is the ultimate gain, you are only interested in impermanent gains like money, kingdom, etc. 



In this *samsaara*, what should be the ultimate goal of one? You are not aware of how that is attained. He told his ministers thus. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 48: *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****इतत * *****उक्त्वा * *****समुपत्यैनं * *****स * *****तु * *****केमशध्वजं * *****नृपः * | *****उवाच * *****क्रकमव्श्यं * *****त्वं * *****ििामस * *****र्ुरुिक्षिणाम् * *****॥ * *****४८ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - Having thought like this, and told them, *Khaandikya Janaka* came to *Keshidhvaja* and asked him - "What is it that you are going to give me as *gurudakshinaa*? Tell me what you will give. Whatever I want, will you give me that?"

When *Keshidhvaja* said that he will give whatever *Khaandikya* asked, then *Khaandikya Janaka* told *Keshidhvaja* that he knew what is *adhyaatma vijnyaana*, and *paramaartha*. The knowledge of *Paramaatman* will get rid of all our grief, and you have that knowledge. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 50: *****यदि * *****चेद्िीयते * *****मह्यं * *****भवता * *****र्ुरुतनस्ष्क्रयः * | *****तत्क्लेशप्रशमायालं * *****यत्कमग * *****तत् * *****उिीरय * *****॥ * *****५० * *****॥ *

If you really want to give me *gurudakshinaa*, tell me what is that which will help me get rid of this *samsaara*. For getting rid of *samsaara* completely, tell me whatever is required, with which means I can get rid of this *samsaara*. Tell that to me. That will be my *gurudakshinaa*. 



This completes Chapter Six.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 **केमशध्वज * *****उवाच * - *****न * *****प्रागथगतं * *****त्वया * *****कथमात् * *****अथमद्राज्यमकण्िकम् * | *****राज्यलाभात् * *****ववना * *****नान्यत् * *****ित्रत्रयाणाम् * *****अततवप्रयम् * *****॥ * *****१ * *****॥ *

*Keshidhvaja* - O *Khaandikya Janaka*. Why did you not ask for my kingdom? I don't think there is anything more dear for a *Kshatriya* than ruling over a kingdom. All the *Kshatriyaas* always want to rule over a kingdom. How come you did not ask me that? 



*Keshidhvaja* is actually testing *Khaandikya Janaka* whether he has really felt grief in this *samsaara*, and really has *nirveda*. A *Kshatriya* can do *prajaa paalana*, can look after his *prajaas*, by ruling over a kingdom only. As a *Kshatriya*, it is your duty to look after your *prajaas*. And you need to rule over a kingdom for that. If you neglect that, it will be a defect on your part. So, he said - "Why are you not asking me for the kingdom?" 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 7, Shloka 2: *****खास्ण्डक्य * *****उवाच * - *****केमशध्वज * *****तनबोर् * *****त्वं * *****मया * *****न * *****प्रागथगतं * *****यतः * | *****राज्यमेतिशेषं * *****ते * *****यत्र * *****र्ृध्नन्त्यपस्ण्डताः * *****॥ * *****२ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****यतः * *****कारणात् * *****न * *****प्रागथगतं * *****तत् * *****शृणु * *****इतत * *****आह * *****केमशध्वज * *****इतत * | ***



*Khaandikya Janaka - O Keshidhvaja*, do know why I did not ask you for a kingdom, where all the people who do not have the *viveka* go and fight over kingdom and other things. I am not like that. 



*Pandita* means - *panda* means knowledge of what is right and what is wrong. One who has this *viveka*, the mind which can distinguish between what is right and what is wrong, is a *pandita*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 7, Shloka 3: *** [[113]] of 194

And killing over the enemies, through *dharma yuddha*, and those who are enemies of our kingdom, have to be killed by a *Kshatriya* in a *dharma yuddha*. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 7, Shloka 4: *****तत्राशक्तथय * *****मे * *****िोषो * *****नैवाथत्यपहृते * *****त्वया * | *****बन्र्ायैव * *****भवत्येषा * *****ह्यववद्या * *****अप्यक्रमोज्झता * *****॥ * *****४ * *****॥ *

When I am weak and not capable of protecting my country, as I lost to you, and you have taken over my kingdom, and because of that, if I am not looking after my *prajaas*, that is not a *dosha* for me. I have lost the kingdom to you. I do not have the *adhikaara* to rule over now. So, there is no dosha there. When *adhikaara* is there for someone, even then, if they leave the kingdom and do not look after the *prajaas*, then it will be a defect on the part of the king. Whereas I do not have the *adhikaara*. That is why there is no dosha for me.

When others have got all the defects, it is all because of their desire and other things which are not correct. Because of the defects of that nature, they desire to rule over a kingdom. That is not a proper *dharma*. It will only lead to very meagre enjoyment of *bhogaas*. I am not like that. For me, it is not *dharma*. It is only with the desire to enjoy all the things here, which are very meagre, and it will not be dharma for me.

What *Keshidhvaja* wanted to test was - in order to rule over the *prajaas*, you have to request for a kingdom, you have to do *yaachanaa*, you have to beg. I am not supposed to beg. Superior *Kshatriyaas* do not beg, even if they want to rule over a kingdom. I will not beg. A *shreshtha Kshatriya* thinks that one should not beg for a kingdom. Ruling over this kingdom, and all of that, I did not ask you.

What was told earlier, that those who do not have the *viveka* go and run after a kingdom, they are always after possession, wanting more and more. This is not correct, they are all *avivekis*. They are not wise. They are as though intoxicated with the drink of *ahamkaara*, and I am not like that.

*Keshidhvaja* - In order to do my *varnaashrama dharma*, to get rid of this *praarabdha karma* which is obstructing the *upaasanaa*, I do various *yaagaas*, and rule over my kingdom. So, this is my *varna dharma*. With all this, I will get rid of my *praarabdha karma*, and my *paapa, punya*, and everything. Whatever punya I have accumulated, that has to be experienced also, all the *bhogaas*, enjoyments have to be done without any attachment; then that will also get exhausted. I am doing that. 



In this *shloka*, in order to tell the *yoga svaroopa*, and what is necessary as a part of that *yoga svaroopa*, in order to do *upaasanaa, bhakti yoga*, one has to know the *aatma svaroopa jnyaana, aatma saakshaatkaara* is also required, one should know the difference and distinction between *prakruti* and *aatma, purusha*, and then have *aatma saakshaatkaara*, and then go and do *bhakti yoga*. Shruti tells about *aatma saakshaatkaara. Avidyayaa mrutyum teertvaa vidyayaa amrutam **ashnute* is told in *Eeshaavaasya Upanishad*. By performing the *varnaashrama* *vihita karma*, the *praarabdha karma* which is obstructing the start of *upaasanaa*, one can get rid of that, and then *upaasanaa* can be started. So, one has to perform *varnaashrama dharma* properly.

*Viveka* itself is *aishwarya*. The wealth of a wise person should be the *viveka* *jnyaana* itself, they should be able to differentiate between what is right and wrong. You are fortunate that your mind is now getting this *viveka*, of what is right and wrong. You did not desire for the kingdom, but are asking me to teach this *adhyaatma vijnyaana*, so you are a *viveki*. You know how to differentiate between what is right and wrong. You are very fortunate to have such a mind. Listen to me about the *svaroopa* of *avidyaa*, I am going to teach you now. *Avidyaa* means the *varnaashrama dharma*, which I am going to teach you its nature.

This is a very important shloka which says what are the two main causes for *samsaara*. These are the two causes for the seeds for the tree of *samsaara*. In order for the tree of *samsaara* to grow, these two are like the seeds for that. \(1\) That which is not *aatma*, thinking that it is *aatma. Deha* is not *aatma*, it is *anaatma*, thinking that *deha* is *aatma*, this is *dehaatma bhramaa*. \(2\) That which is required to nurture and grow the body, that is what is required for me, if one thinks like that, they will only look after their body, and not their *aatma*. Thinking that it belongs to me. *Kaamya karmaas* which are having some fruits, for the enjoyment of the individual self, performing those, they get impermanent fruits, and benefits which will not last long. This will only make one to be more and more in *samsaara* only. This is the cause of the tree of *samsaara*.

*Ahamkaara* and *mamakaara*, thinking that what is not mine is mine, all the things needed to look after the body, thinking that they are all belonging to me, near to me. This body which is made of *pancha bhootaas*, this body belongs to me, it is mine, he thinks wrongly. 



Four *shlokaas* explain this *ahamkaara* and *mamakaara*. This *dehi*, who is the *aatman*, this individual self, thinks that this *panchabhootaatmaka shareera*, body made up of five elements, thinks that the body is mine, that I am the body. He has the idea that he is the *aatman*, in the body, the *dehaatma bhramaa*. He thinks that the land and other things, that they all belong to him, that he is the owner, that he owns this, and this is all mine. He is covered by *poorva karma vaasanaa*, the impressions which have come from earlier births.

This body is made of *pancha bhootaas*, five elements, so it is separate from the *aatman*.

House, land and other things, are enjoyed by the body only. Because he is endowed with this body, this *panchabhootaatmaka deha*, and it is not in *aatma* *svaroopa*. These kind of enjoyments are not there in *aatma svaroopa*. In this *aatma*, which is not the body, how can he even think that this is mine. House, land, are for the purpose of enjoyment of the body only, not the *aatman*. In *aatma svaroopa*, these are all not there. He thinks that these are all mine, which are all connected only because of this body. In this *samsaara*, he is born as a  [[118]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 human or deva, and gets different enjoyments because of all these births. They are all because of the body with which he is associated. Thinking that the body itself is the *aatman*, and thinking that all these house and land which do not belong to him, which are not connected with the *aatman*, as *aatma svaroopa* is *parishuddha* and these are not connected, as belonging to him - no wise person will think like that.

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****इत्थं * *****च * *****इतत * | *****अनात्मतन * *****आत्मनो * *****अन्यस्थमन् * *****सतत * | ***



*Kalebara*, body is different from the *aatman*. The son, grandson, and others, who are all born of the body only, how can a knowledgeable, wise person think that these are all mine? All these are related only to the body, the *sambandha* is *shareera sambandha*, it is not *aatma sambandha*. The relationship of son, grandson, are not there in the *aatma svaroopa*; they are all because of the body, which is associated with *prakruti*. How can someone think that he is the owner of this, the master of this, that this thing belongs to him, etc., when the body is different from the *aatman*?

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 7, Shloka 16: *****सवं * *****िेहोपभोर्ाय * *****कुरुते * *****कमग * *****मानवः * | *****िेहश्चान्यो * *****यिा * *****पुंसः * *****तिा * *****बन्र्ाय * *****तत्परम् * *****॥ * *****१६ * *****॥ *

Because of the twofold ignorance, thinking of what is not belonging to him as belonging to him, that he is the master, owner of all that, when it is not really so, and thinking of the body as the *aatman*, when they are very different from each other, will only bind him more and more into *samsaara*. Because of this, if he does all acts only for the enjoyment of the body, he will be bound in the *samsaara* only. Because of these two kinds of misconceptions, wrong understandings, if he does all the *karmaas* only for the enjoyment of the body, that will only bind him more and more. All acts he does only for the enjoyment of the body. It will be  [[119]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 again, for bandha, for giving birth to more bodies only. He will have more children, grandchildren, etc. which will put him more and more into *samsaara*.

Mixing water and mud, the house is smeared and made of mud only. Similarly, this body is also *paarthiva*, a modification of *pruthivi* only, and it is also made of mud and water. Here, out of five, only *pruthivi* is told here, there are different opinions like that. After *pancheekarana, pruthivi* itself has all the five elements in different proportions.

And the body is also *panchabhootaatmaka*. The body which is made of five elements is pleased with the objects of the senses which are also *panchabhootaatmaka*. What is this enjoyment for the *aatman* who is there, who is very different and distinct from the *panchabhootaatmaka* body? 





The next two *shlokaas* tell how this kind of a wrong understanding or *ajnyaana* can be got rid of. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 7, Shloka 19: *****अनेकजन्मसाहस्रीं * *****संसारपिवीं * *****व्रजन् * | *****मोहश्रमं * *****प्रयातो * *****असौ * *****वासनारेणुकुस्ण्ठतः * *****॥ * *****१९ * *****॥ * ***This is also an often quoted *shloka*. Thousands and thousands of births are coming in this path of *samsaara*, the cycle of births and deaths and births and deaths. He is extremely tired, and there is *moha*, because of the ignorance and wrong understanding, and all the delusion. He has the *vaasanaas*, the reminiscent impressions, from birth to birth to birth, where he is repeatedly doing some actions, and engaging in worldly enjoyments, related to body and senses, and  [[120]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 because of that, he has developed these *vaasanaas*, impressions, continuing from birth to birth. He is suffering great grief because of his ignorance. 



An individual self has taken thousands of births, and he is treading the path of *samsaara*, and he has got tremendous amount of grief, because of the ignorance, which is *mohashrama*, and because of the *vaasanaas*, which is *ajnyaana* *karma* *ubhaya vaasanaa*, which is ignorance, and *karma*, the reminiscent impressions getting passed on from birth to birth. And this is causing him all the grief and suffering. He has been suffering for innumerable births like this. 



This further continues, and there is description of *aatma svaroopa, yoga*. Which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the *adhyaatma jnyaana* that he has to *Khaandikya Janaka*. This starts with the teaching of the nature of the individual self, and the body, this *tattva jnyaana*, and then he goes on to teach the nature of the means, the *yoga*.

When this ignorance is destroyed, when the grief is destroyed by proper knowledge, *tattva jnyaana*, the ignorance is dispelled, then he will be experiencing his real nature, he will get the *aatma svaroopa jnyaana*, which is incomparable, and there is nothing which can exceed this. This is the supreme  [[121]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 bliss he will experience. There is no grief at all there. He will experience the joy of supreme bliss. When he gets the proper knowledge, his ignorance is dispelled.

The nature of the self is told here. This is the nature of bliss. The nature of the individual self is pure consciousness. He is without any defect. Grief and ignorance, these are qualities of *prakruti*, are all belonging to matter, in association with matter; this is not in the real nature of the individual self; is because of the association with matter that he is getting this. 



The fruits of various acts, *karmaas* which we do, are all due to the karma, whereas the *aatma svaroopa*, is always *aananda* only. The nature of *aatman* is bliss and pure consciousness, without any defect. It is like this - there is a gem which is covered with dust, and it is not shining, we don't see a shine as it is covered with a lot of dust; if the gemstone is cleaned, and the dust is removed, it shines forth with its natural radiance; this radiance is not created newly, but it is just covered with dust; that radiance always existed in the gem; when the dust is removed, the gem shines in its original state of radiance. In the same way, the individual self, who is of the nature of supreme bliss and consciousness, *jnyaana* and *aananda*, and whose attributive consciousness, *dharma bhoota jnyaana* which is always infinite, is covered and contracted because of the association with matter; these have come because of the *karmaas* that he has been doing forever. He has to experience the fruits of that. When he attains liberation, the veil of karma is removed, and then he will be in his natural state. His knowledge is not newly created, but he will be in his natural state. He is the knower, and his  [[122]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 knowership is never lost. His *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is always infinite, but it is covered and contracted because of association with *prakruti*. When he attains liberation, he goes and reaches *Parabrahman*, in *Paramapada, Vaikuntha*, and his original form will be coming into force at that time. This is not newly created, it always existed, and now the veil of *karma* is removed. His *dharma bhoota **jnyaana* is always associated with him inseparably, and this is eternal. Just as the *aatma svaroopa* is *nitya*, his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is also *nitya*. The logicians, and the *naiyaayikaas* say that the *jnyaana* is not *nitya*, that it comes and goes, that we acquire new knowledge, and we forget it; but this kind of argument is against the *Shrutis*, the *Vedaas. Ajnyaana* and *dukha*, ignorance and grief are not experienced by matter as matter does not have knowership, as it is *achetana*, not having *jnyaana*. Because of the association with matter, he experiences grief, and it is not in his original state because the association with matter is coming in order to experience the fruits of karma, which he has been doing forever. When did the karma start, it is *anaadi*, beginningless; because of this, he has been accumulating *punya* and *paapa*, and then to experience the results of *punya* and *paapa*, he has to take different births, and so he is taking births again and again. But, in his real nature, there is no grief; in his nature, there is only bliss, *sukha*, and *jnyaana*. As he is experiencing the grief and ignorance due to association with *prakruti*, these are said to be the qualities of *prakruti* itself. The body cannot experience *sukha*, as it is *achetana*, it does not have knowledge. It is told in *Bhagavad Geeta* that he is associated with prakruti, and he experiences *sukha, dukha*. If it is taken that *prakruti* itself is experiencing these, then it is against the *pramaanaas. Prakruti* does not experience as it does not have knowership.

There is an example given here. When water is put in a pot and then heated, because of being there in the pot and getting heated, the association with the heat, it starts to boil and make noise. These are all not the natural qualities of water. This is all happening because of its association with heat, and coming in contact with heat, being inside the pot, which gets heated; because of this, the  [[123]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 water gets heated, and because of this, it is having these qualities. The original quality of water is being cold, *sheeta*; it does not have bubbles, and does not make noise, having bubbles and making noise are not the natural qualities of water. In the same way, the *aatman*, in its essential nature is without any defect, and is *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*. By the association with matter, *aatma*, the individual self starts to think that this body itself is the self, and starts to experience grief. Just as water is coming in contact with fire, and it is inside the pot, in a similar way, *prakruti* is associated with *jeevaatman*, and the *jeevaatman* experiences *aadhyaatmika, aadhibhoutika, aadhidaivika taapaas*. Because of the association with matter, he gets all these *taapaas*, and he thinks that these are all in his original nature, whereas they are not in his real nature. His real nature is pure *jnyaana* and *aananda svaroopa*, and he does not have any defects like grief.

Because of this, he experiences grief which is not in his real nature. He is unchangeable, does not undergo any modification. In his real nature, he is pure. He is different from *prakruti*, as told here.

Like this, I have told you the nature of *avidyaa*. I have told you the root cause of *avidyaa*. The means to getting rid of *klesha, karma*, is *yoga*, and there is nothing else. *Khaandikya Janaka* had asked a question - what is the means to get rid of all these difficulties, grief, *karma*. The answer is that *yoga* only is the answer to this. *Yoga* means the meditation upon the *Paramaatman*.

*Keshidhvaja* - O *Khaandikya*, do listen to me, I am going to explain to you the nature of *yoga*. One who is practicing *yoga*, will attain unity with *Paramaatman*, and he will never fall back from that, he will never come into this *samsaara* again. 



*Brahma laya* does not mean merging into *Brahman*. This does not mean losing one's identity. There will be two substances only - *jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman*. *Jeevaatman* will not get destroyed. It will be *Brahmabhaava* - *jeevaatman* will get similar characteristics as *Brahman*. His *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will be exactly same as *Parabrahman*. Even in *Karma kaanda*, the various *karmaas* are told; when they perform the *karmaas* and worship *Indra* and other *devataas*, it is said that they go and merge with those *devaas*; this is not so; they go and attain their worlds and enjoy there. Or also as *Prahlaada's* experience, where he thought of himself as *Achyuta*, he had that experience; he experienced the *Parabrahman* who was the inner self of himself, this he addressed as *'Aham' *, the *deha vishishta **aatma vishishta Paramaatman*, the *Paramaatman* who is *aatman* to him.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 For *manushyaas*, humans, mind only is the cause of getting bound in the *samsaara*, as well as getting liberated. With the same mind, one can get attached to everything here and stay in *samsaara*, or, one can practice *yoga* and get liberated. When one is attached to the sense objects, then he will always be bound in *samsaara*. When he takes away his mind from the sense objects, when he controls the sense objects and does not go under their sway, he can get liberated. From these *shlokaas, Keshidhvaja* is going to explain the nature of *yoga*, and the causes, *angaas* or accessories, the *vishaya* or object, and *phala* or fruit.

One has to withdraw the mind from the sense objects. And concentrate it on the individual self. And then, he has to meditate upon the *Parabrahman* for liberation. He has to attain the distinctive knowledge among *prakruti, purusha* and *Eeshvara*, the nature of individual self, matter and *Paramaatman*, about how they are different and distinct from each other. Then he has to meditate in his mind, and the object of meditation should be *Parameshvara*.

Here, the *phala* is going to be told, the fruit of such a *yoga*. One who meditates upon *Parabrahman* like this, he can realize the self. *Vikaaryatva* is *aatyantika **laya*, which is complete destruction, that he will totally get destroyed; he is currently in the state of *anaadi avidyaa* and *karma* which is coming from beginningless time, and the *vaasanaas* which are coming from birth to birth, and  [[126]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 the various bodies that he is taking, being bound in all of avidyaa, karma, *vaasanaa, deha*, since beginningless time; such an individual self, with the knowledge of *Bhagavaan*, when he meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, that state will be destroyed; and he will not have any of *avidyaa, karma, vaasanaa, deha*; and all the experiences, feelings, emotions, which are due to association with matter will be destroyed; this is called *aatyantika laya*; where all the *karmaas* will get destroyed totally, and he will be freed; and this is *vikaaryatva*.

When he gets moksha, when he gets liberated in *Paramapada*, he gets all kinds of enjoyment. Here *Baadaraayanar* quotes the *pramaana* of *Jaimini Rishi*, who says that *jeevaatman* attains the nature of *Brahman* when he gets liberated, that his *dharmabhoota jnyaana* becomes equal to *Brahman*, and he also gets the *apahatapaapmaatvaadi ashta gunaas*. The opinion of *Jaimini* is told by *Baadaraayanar* in this *Brahma Sutra*. What is established in this *Brahma Sutra* is that he will get infinite bliss.

Gold also becomes like fire as it shines, burns like fire, when it comes in contact with fire; when all its impurities are removed, it shines like fire. When gold is impure, it will not shine forth. When it is put into fire, all the impurities are removed, and it shines forth like anything, and fire causes the gold to shine forth similar to itself. In the same way, when we think about *Parabrahman*, when a *yogi* meditates upon *Parabrahman*, his mind becomes pure and he gets liberated, and all his sins are destroyed completely, his *punya* and *paapa* and everything. And he attains *Brahmabhaava. Paramaatman* makes him to attain a nature similar to him with respect to his attributive consciousness.

In these three-four *shlokaas*, the nature of *yoga*, the object of meditation, the fruit are all told. Now, is told in detail the nature of *yoga*, till the end of this chapter. From beginningless time, the self is always associated with matter, and always after experience of the sense objects. The impressions are continuing from birth to birth forever. And it is very difficult to attain *Paramaatman*. One has to put a lot of effort to attain him. That requires the *aatma prayatna*, the efforts of the individual self, because the individual self is always associated with *karma*, *vaasanaa*, etc. That meditation which is constant, continuous, and without any break, when it is done, leads to vivid perception of the Lord. It is of the nature of unparalleled bliss. Whatever are the stored defects of the mind, that mind has to be associated with *Brahman*, should be focussed on Brahman. This is called *yoga*. There is another thought, where the meaning of *yoga* is *laya*, where *aatma* and *Paramaatman* become one; there will be no two objects, only one will exist; this thought is refuted here, not accepted here. Because *yoga* is told as meditating upon the *divya mangala vigraha* of *Brahman*, which will be told later. One substance cannot become another substance. When the two are merged, the nature of both will remain as it is. One cannot lose its identity completely, there is no *svaroopa naasha*. So, *laya* is not accepted here.

Whatever was explained, with all the attributes, with associated accessories, etc., that kind of *yoga* which is the *dharma*, one who has all this kind of *yoga*, who is practicing this, is said to be a *mumukshu, moksham icchuh mumukshuh*, one who is desirous of attaining liberation. The means to attain *moksha* is *yoga*. And that is a form of *dharma*. It is a *dharma* means that it has to be practiced, to be put into practice. Its *anusthaana* has to be done. Mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* does not lead to *moksha*. Just a knowledge of the *Upanishadic* sentences will not give *moksha*.  [[129]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 One has to learn that, and has to meditate upon what is told in the *Upanishads*. The first step is understanding the Upanishadic statement, but after that, it has to be put to practice. One has to do *upaasanaa*, meditation. It is not an *avidheya* *jnyaana*, it has a *vidhi*, it is simply not *vaakyaartha jnyaana*. It is beyond *vaakyaartha jnyaana*. The other arguments are refuted here. 



It has got many special characteristics, and it is a *dharma*. It has to be practiced.

When one practices *yoga*, in the initial stages, when still practicing *yoga*, he is said to be a *yogayuk*. And one who has attained *samaadhi*, having passed through all the stages of *yoga*, and attained the final stage of beatitude, he will attain *Parambrahma*, he is said to be *vinishpanna samaadhi*. 



Based on the state in which a *yogi* is, the names are different. One who has started on *yoga* and is still progressing, is called *yogayuk*. One who has realized *Paramaatman*, is called *vinishpanna samaadhi. Samaadhi* comes after *dhyaana*. Up to *dhyaana*, the seven stages told - *yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, **pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa, dhyaana* - whoever is in all these stages is called a *yogayuk*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 One who is *vinishpanna samaadhi*, he gets liberated in the same birth itself. With the fire of *yoga*, all his *karma* will be destroyed.

Up to that, it may take many many births for him. Whereas one who has gone into the *samaadhi* state, will get liberated in one birth itself. *Antaraaya* are the various obstructions which come in the practice of yoga before attaining the perfection in yoga. Up to the state of *dhaaranaa - yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, **dhaaranaa* - there are ten *antaraayaas* like *aalasya*. In *Patanjali Sutraas*, these are told as those which distract the mind from concentrations - *vyaadhi, **sthyaana, samshaya, pramaada, aalasya, avirati, bhraanti darshana, alabdha **bhoomikatva, anavasthitatva* - these are the *chitta vikshepa* causes, *antaraayaas*. They cause the meditation to be not steady. In *Patanjali Sutraas*, nine such obstructions are told. *Sri Engal Aalwaan* quotes from *Vaayu Samhita* as ten obstructions.

These are told in the *Yoga Sutraas*. These are told similarly here. For the one who is practicing yoga, these are all the obstructions which come in the way.

*Bhadraasana, Svastika*, the various *aasanaas* are all told by *Yaajnyavalkya*. Endowed with all the qualities, one should sit in a proper *aasana, sthiram sukham* *aasanam*. With *Yama* and *Niyama*, whatever was told, endowed with all of this, one should practice *yoga* and meditate upon *Brahman*. 



Next, will be told about *Praanaayaama*. Which is explained in detail, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the nature of *yoga* to *Khaandikya Janaka*. In this, he told about *Yama, Niyama, Aasana*, the initial three *angaas* of *yoga*. Now, he is going to teach about *Praanaayaama* and further stages.

There are two types of *Praanaayaama - Sabeeja* and *Abeeja*. With practice, one who controls the *praana*, through *Praanaayaama, Sabeeja* is with an *aalambana*, doing the *Praanaayaama* with the *dhyaana* of either *Bhagavaan's divya mangala * [[134]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *vigraha*, or chanting a *mantra*, or *mantra japa* - this is *Sabeeja. Sagarbha **Praanaayaama*. Without any of these is *Abeeja*, simply doing the *Praanaayaama*.

*Rechaka, Pooraka, Kumbhaka* are the three parts of *Praanaayaama. Rechaka* is *ucchvaasa, nishvaasa, abhibhava* - where *ucchvaasa* is taking in, *nishvaasa* is leaving out, and controlling and stopping it, this is *Rechaka*. The opposite of that is *Pooraka*, is said to be of two types. The *ucchvaasa* and *nishvaasa* are told together, and they join together in *Kumbhaka*, when the breath is controlled inside. These three are again of three types, by the difference in duration, *maatraa bheda*, the number of *maatraas* during which it is done. 



**यथा * *****उक्तम् * \* *****मात्राद्वािशको * *****मन्िश्चतुववंशततमात्रकः * | *****मध्यमः * *****प्राणसंरोर्ः * *****ष्त्रत्रम्शन्मात्र * *****उत्तमः * *****॥ * ***When *Praanaayaama* is done for 12 *maatraas*, it is said to be *manda*. When it is for 24 *maatraas* in duration, it is said to be *madhyama*. When it is done for 36 *maatraas*, it is said to be *uttama*. 



**प्रथवेिकम्पनोत्थानजनकाथते * *****यथाक्रमम् * | ***When *Praanaayaama* is done for 12 *maatraas* and is practiced continuously for a period of time, then the *yogi* who is practicing *Praanaayaama*, will feel perspiration. This is one sign that he is mastering the Praanaayaama. The second stage is *kampana*, there will be involuntary tremors in the body, and this is felt in the *madhyama*, when he practices for 24 *maatraas*. When he does for 36 *maatraas*, then it is *utthaana*, the *praana* is said to raise and reach the *Brahma* *Randhra*, this is told in *yoga*.

The rotating of the knee joint, when one does with the sound of thumb and middle finger, and makes a round around that, at a normal speed, this duration is said to be a *maatraa*.

And *Aayaama* is stopping, controlling it. This is said to be *Rechaka, Pooraka, Kumbhaka. Pooraka* is filling in, *Rechaka* is leaving out. And *Kumbhaka* is stopping it. First, all the air is left out, then it is filled, and then stopped for some time. These are the three told in *Praanaayaama*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Agarbha*. When *Japa* and *Dhyaana* are included, then it is *Sagarbha*. There are hundreds of types, with different combinations. This is about *Praanaayaama* explained in the Commentary.

One who needs an *aalambana*, a *dhyaana* of *Bhagavaan*, the form of *Ananta*, *Bhagavaan's divya mangala vigraha* which is meditated upon, the *yogis* practice by meditating on that. 



The *moorta roopa* of *Bhagavaan*, the form of *Bhagavaan*, is *sabeeja*.

This is *Pratyaahaara* told here. These two *shlokaas* are telling about *Pratyaahaara*. The *indriyaas* which are always going after *shabda, sparsha, roopa*, *rasa, gandha*, the sense objects, controlling them from that, and withdrawing them is called *Pratyaahaara*. One has to withdraw all the *indriyaas*, and make his mind steady and free from all these sense objects.

Controlling the *praana* with *Praanaayaama*, with *Pratyaahaara*, controlling the *indriyaas*, the sense organs - controlling both of these, he has to meditate upon the *Shubhaashraya* of *Paramaatman*, the *divya mangala vigraha* of *Paramaatman*. 



In the mind, the *sthoola roopa* of *Paramaatman* has to be steadily contemplated upon. This is said to be *Dhaaranaa*.

*Khaandikya* asks a question - Please do tell me what is this *Shubhaashraya* which is to be placed in the mind, and one has to contemplate on that. And meditating upon which one destroys all the *doshaas*, defects. Mala is the *raaga, dvesha*. *Dosha* is any other impurities of the mind. They will all be destroyed by meditating upon the *Shubhaashraya* of *Bhagavaan*.

*Keshidhvaja* - The *aashraya* for the mind, the support for the mind, the mind has to have an object to think about, one has to meditate upon an object only. Without an object, one cannot do meditation. That *aashraya* for the mind, is of two types - the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, and *para roopa* and *apara roopa*. 



Initially, the *ashubhaashraya* is told. *Shubhaashraya* is to be told, before that, first, the *ashubhaashraya* is told, those which are not *Shubhaashraya*. The *Baddha* *jeevaas, Mukta jeevaas* are all not *Shubhaashraya*, as they are either *ashubha*, or they do not have *aashraya*. Only *Bhagavaan's* form is *Shubhaashraya*. Before telling the *Bhagavaan's* form, which is *Shubhaashraya*, the *ashubhaashraya* which are not fit for meditation, are told now with *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*. These are the *Kshara* and *Akshara* told in *Bhagavad Geeta **- Ksharah sarvaani bhootaani kootastho akshara uchyate*. And *Para* and *Apara* are told. *Moorta roopa* is the *Chaturmukha Brahma* and all the bound selves, who are in the *prakruti mandala*, and are having a body; they are associated with matter, *prakruti*, and they have a *praakruta shareera*; starting from *Chaturmukha* down to all the beings in this *prakruti mandala*, the bound selves. *Amoorta* is without a *shareera*, the *mukta* *roopa*, the liberated selves. One is *Para*, and another is *Apara*. 



How can they be told as *Brahma dvidhaa*? Because they are all *Brahmaatmaka*. *Moorta roopaas* and *Amoorta roopaas* are also that of *Parabrahman* only as they all have *Brahman* only as their inner self. This *Brahmaatmaka naanaatva* is told in the *Shrutis* only. *Abrahmaatmaka naanaatva* is what is negated. *Moorta* and *Amoorta* are said to be *Brahman* only, as they are *Brahmaatmaka*. They are also forms of *Bhagavaan* only, as told in *Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma*. But can they be meditated upon, if a question arises, they are not fit for meditation. In order to tell this, this has been told by *Keshidhvaja* initially. First, he tells about the *baddha* *svaroopa*, and the *muktaas*. He says that both are not fit for meditation. And then he tells about *Bhagavat roopa*, which is *Shubhaashraya*.

There are three *bhaavanaas* told. In this whole world, in this *prakruti mandala*, everyone is having these three *bhaavanaas* - they are *Brahmabhaavanaa*, *Karmabhaavanaa, Ubhayabhaavanaa*. It will be explained who have all these things.

*Sanaka, Sanandana*, and others who are the *maanasa putraas* of *Brahma*, are all having *Brahmabhaavanaa* only. From *Devaas* up to the *sthaavaraas*, including *manushyaas*, which are all *avara*, all of them are having *Karmabhaavanaa*. It is told that the *sthaavaraas* are the last in that category - it is told as *deva*, *manushya, tiryak, sthaavara*. Even for *Himavat parvata*, some *karma adhikaara* is  [[140]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 told in the *Puraanaas. Bilva*, the trees are also said to be having some *karma* *adhikaara*, they also do some *karmaas*, there is a *chetana* in them also. That is why it is told as *avara* here.

*Adhikara* is thinking that whatever *karma* one does, is for my purpose only, and for me to gain whatever fruits I want. If one wants *svarga phala*, then this *karma* is for me to attain this *svarga phala*. Like that, if one thinks that it is for them, and for attaining whatever desires they have, and this is said to be *adhikaara*. Whoever in this *samsaara dashaa*, thinks that the *karmaas* are for fulfilling various desires for them, are meant for them, is told here. Hiranyagarbha and others have both *Brahmabhaavanaa* and *Karmabhaavanaa*. Anyone performing *karmaas* for their own purpose, they have all these *bhaavanaas*.

Whatever is there in this world, having *deva, manushyaadi aakaara*, etc., for them, till the *tattva jnyaana* is not yet arisen, and they are still engaged in *karmaas*, here the *vishesha jnyaana* is the differences existing in *deva, manushya*, and others, that only is the *aatma*, thinking that the body itself is the *aatman*,  [[141]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 getting a liking for that, and thinking that "I am only this body", and then performing all the acts according to that. When he gets into the body of a *deva*, or *manushya*, or *krimi* or *keeta*, they get *abhimaana* in those *dehaas*, and do all the acts according to that - this is said to be *vishesha jnyaana*, and the *karma* is said to be *vishesha karma*. 



In this *shloka*, we have to stop one sentence at *vishvametat*. This whole world is made of those who think that the body itself is the *aatman*, and they are engaged in those acts only according to whatever body they get. 



Up to *vishvametat* is told the *baddha svaroopa*. After that, from the word param onwards, to *paramaatmanaH* in *shloka* 54, the *para roopa* is told, which is *amoorta*, which is the *mukta svaroopa*. These are also commented in the *Shreebhaashyam* by *Bhaashyakaarar*. *Druk* is *jnyaana*, and *bhedabhinnadruk* means seeing the various differences in the bodies itself as differences in the *aatman* - one who thinks that the *aatman* is itself having all these differences and varieties. Those who are different from that, and those who are other than *Brahma, Sanaka, Sanandana*, etc., are said to para.

*Para* and *apara* - two forms are told, which are *moorta* and *amoorta*. *Para roopa* is *amoorta roopa*, and *apara roopa* is *moorta roopa*. The *para roopa* is being told now. 



*Para svaroopa* is *mukta*. They do not have this *praakruta shareera*. They do not have *jaati, varna*, etc. There is no difference like *manushya jaati, deva jaati* - this difference does not exist in the liberated self. That is why, they are beyond words, because we cannot call them as *deva, manushya*, etc., as we see in terms of the bound selves who belong to various classes. Among the *muktaas*, these classes do  [[142]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 not exist. So, they are said to be *vachasaam agocharam*. The *muktaas* cannot be called as *deva, manushya*, etc. 



There are six *bhaavaas* told, *shat bhaavaas - asti, jaayate, vardhate, **viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*. Out of these *shat bhaavaas*, five are not there for *muktaas*, and only *asti* is there. *Jaayate* \(gets born\), *vardhate* \(grows\), *viparinamate* \(undergoes changes\), *apaksheeyate* \(declines\), *nashyati* \(perishes\) are not there for the *muktaas*. 



They know themselves, they have *pratyaktva. Jnyaanam* means the *mukta* *svaroopa* can be established only with *jnyaatrutva, jnyaana guna*. One who has the *jnyaana*, but is said to be the *jnyaana* itself. This is the most essential characteristic of the nature of the *aatman*. This is told in a *Brahma sootra - Tat* *gunasaaratvaat tat vyapadeshah praajnyavat*. Because it is the *saarabhoota guna* of *jeevaatman*, the *jnyaatrutva*, it is said to be *jnyaana* itself. Just as *Paramaatman* is told *Aanando brahma. Niratishaya aananda svaroopa* is *aananda* *guna*. So, He is said to be *aananda* itself. 



The *jnyaana svaroopa* is also told to be *aatma samvedya, svayam prakaasha*. This itself says *jnyaana svaroopa. Jnyaana svaroopa* and *guna* are both established here. 



Because it is *Brahmaatmaka*, it is said to be *Brahma samjnitam*. It is said to be *Brahma*.

*Aroopa* is that which is different from *vishvaroopa. Vishvaroopa* is all the *baddha* *jeevaas*. That which is different from them, is *amoorta*. This is also a form of *Bhagavaan* only, as they are all *Brahmaatmaka*. This is said to be *amoorta* and *aroopaakhya*. And it is different from *moorta roopa*. This is said to be the *para* *roopa* of *Paramaatman*. 



 [[143]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Two *roopaas* of *Paramaatman* are told - *para roopa* and *apara roopa. Para roopa* is *amoorta*, and *apara roopa* is *moorta*, which is the *baddha svaroopa*. *Para roopa* is *mukta svaroopa*. Both are the forms of *Paramaatman*. Because they are also *Bhagavadaatmaka*, they are also forms of *Paramaatman*. However, the *baddhaas* and *muktaas* do not have *Shubhaashraya*; they are not fit to be object of meditation for a *mumukshu*, for a *bhagavat yogi*. This will be told now.

... all of these which have the *trividha bhaavanaas, brahma bhaavana, karma **bhaavana, ubhaya bhaavana*, this gross form of *Paramaatman*, though it can be meditated upon as it has a gross form, it has this *bhaavanaa traya*. Because of that, it is *ashuddha*, it is impure and not fit for meditation, it is not said to be *Shubhaashraya*, it is *ashubhaashraya. Idam vishvam* is the conclusion of whatever is told in this world. From *Jagadetat charaacharam* is a separate sentence. This is all said to be the *shakti* of *Vishnu* only. *Shakti, amsha, tanu, vapu, shareera* - all of these are *paryaaya padaas*, synonyms. This is controlled by *Paramaatman*, supported by Him, and meant for His purpose. He is the master of that. It is all *shakti* because it is supported by His *sankalpa shakti*. Just like our *shareera*, as our *Jeevaatman* is pervading the whole body, and is controlling by his willing only. In the same way, *Paramaatman* controls the whole world of sentients and non-sentients. There is another way of commenting on this, as told by some people.

The third *shakti* of *Paramaatman* is also going to be told. The first two are *paraa* *shakti*, and *aparaa shakti*, and the third is *avidyaa*. This is also called *karma*. The *paraa shakti* is the *mukta svaroopa*. The *kshetrajnyaas* are told as *aparaa*, told as *Hiranyagarbha*, etc., the bound selves. *Avidyaa* is the *yaaga* and other *karmaas*, performing which one gains all the fruits, and they are bound here. *Prakruti* *sambandha* is continuing because of this *avidyaa* for the sentients. The cause of this *prakruti sambandha* is said to be the third *shakti* of *Paramaatman*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 This *aparaa shakti* which was told as *kshetrajnyaas*, the bound selves, their knowledge is covered by *avidyaa*, which is the third shakti, karma. Their *dharmabhoota jnyaana* is contracted, covered. And it is relative in all the beings. For some, the *jnyaana* is more, and for some, it is less. The order in which the *jnyaana* varies is going to be told. 



**सिवभूिेषु** * ***भूपाल** * ***िारिम्येन** * ***लक्ष्यिे** * ***॥** is a *pramaana*. The *dharmabhoota jnyaana* gets contracted and expanded. There is a difference in *dharmabhoota jnyaana* among the various beings. It is less for *manushyaas*, and more for *devaas*. For *muktaas*, it is in its original natural state, which is *ananta*, all pervading. Here, because of *avidyaa*, it is covered, and there is a relative difference among all the beings.

The *taaratamya*, the relative differences are told here. In mountains, in wooden pieces, it is very very less. The *jeevaatmans* who are there in all these are of the same nature. and they are all very subtle, *sookshma*; and there is no *vikaara* in their *svaroopa* at any point of time, either in the bound state or any state. There is no *vikaara* in the essential nature of *jeevaatman*. It is only in the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaana* that the contraction and expansion happens, and differences exist among the *jeevaatmans*. Being less and more is not in the *svaroopa*, but in the *jnyaana* *aananda dharma* only; they experience less happiness, and their knowledge is limited. In serpents and other beings, it is a little more than stone, wood. In birds, it is still more.

Compared to the birds, deer and other animals have more. *Pashus* like cow and others have still more. Humans have more than the *pashus*, with the *jnyaana* shakti which they have. The *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of humans is much more expanded, compared to cow and others.

Compared to all the *devaas*, the *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of *Indra* is much more. More or less means that it is covered by *avidyaa*. It is always in its original state, and in *moksha* also, it is not newly created. It is like a diamond or gem being covered by dust. When the dust is removed, it shines in its original state. The shine is not newly created. In the same way, the *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of all the sentient beings is covered with more or less dust, so that the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaana* is less or more expanded. The difference is only in this. *Indra* has the maximum *dharmabhoota jnyaana* compared to all the *devaas*. *Prajaapati* has more than *Indra. Hiranyagarbha* has much more. These are the relative differences in *dharmabhoota jnyaana*.

*Bhagavaan's moorta roopa* is the *apara roopa, apara shakti*; and *amoorta roopa* is *para roopa*. The *moorta roopa* was told so far, how the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaanaas* are varying, and though it is *sthoola*, it is *ashubhaashraya*, and is not fit for meditation by a *bhagavat yogi*, this is the *bhaavanaa trayaatmaka roopa*; all the *baddhaas* have *bhaavanaa traya*. The second one, is called *Vishnu Samjnyaa*, *Vishnu*, and it is told to be fit for meditation by a *yogi*, and is said to be *amoorta* *roopa* of *Paramaatman. Muktaas* do not have the *bhaavanaa traya*. 



Now, the *mukta, amoorta roopa* is being told here. This is told as *sattaa **maatram*. This can be meditated upon by a *nishpanna yogi*, one who has come to the *dhaaranaa* stage. This is also called by the name *Vishnu*, as it is all *Brahmaatmaka*. This form will be told now, and *Bhagavaan's divya mangala* *vigraha* is going to be told in detail, which we see next. This *divya mangala **vigraha* only is fit for meditation by *bhagavat yogi*. The *para* and *apara roopaas* are not fit for meditation by a *bhagavat yogi*. 



From *Chaturmukha Brahma* to the lowest beings in this world, all are having this *bhaavanaa traya* - the *Brahma bhaavanaa, Karma bhaavanaa, Ubhaya * [[149]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *bhaavanaa*. So, they are all *Bhaavanaa trayaatmaka*. The one without *Bhaavanaa* *traya* is called *amoorta roopa*, and it is *mukta roopa*. 



One who is still in any of the *angaas* of *yoga* is said to be a *prakraanta yogi*, who is professing his *yoga*, who has not reached the final stage. Only a *nishpanna yogi* can think of the *mukta svaroopa*. So, the *moorta, amoorta* are both told. 



Now, will be told the *Bhagavat roopa*. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the nature of *yoga* to *Khaandikya Janaka*, the *bhagavat yoga, bhakti yoga*. First, he described about the various *angaas* of *yoga - yama, niyama, aasana*, etc. Now, for *dhaaranaa*, he is talking about the object of meditation. Before telling about the *Bhagavat divya mangala vigraha*, as the *upaasya*, he is telling about the two forms of *Paramaatman, moorta* and *amoorta*. 



Where the *moorta roopa* is all the forms seen in this world, having *chetanaas* and *achetanaas*, which are all *shareera* to Him - *roopa* is also told as *shareera, shakti* - He is all pervading through His *sankalpa*. Just like a *jeevaatman* pervaded this body, *Bhagavaan* is pervading the entire world, consisting of the sentients and non-sentients. He is controlling and supporting all of them. 



Then, he tells about the *amoorta roopa*, which is said to be *sattaa maatra*. *Sattaamaatram agocharam vachasaam* was told earlier. This is the form being told here. This is the *mukta svaroopa*. And it is said to be *yogi dhyeya* in the sense that it can be meditated upon only by a *yogi*, who has already perfected his *yoga*, a *nishpanna yogi*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 It was told about three *shaktis* of *Paramaatman* - *para roopa, apara roopa* and *karma/avidyaa. Para shakti* is the *muktaas, aparaa shakti* is all the *baddhaas*, and *avidyaa/karma* is another *shakti* because of which *jeevaatmans* get associated with *prakruti*. All these three *shaktis* are established in *Bhagavaan's roopa*, which is very different from all these. This is told here. 



After having told about the three *shaktis* which are all residing in *Bhagavaan's* *divya mangala vigraha*, in the form of *astraas, bhooshanaas*, all the weapons, dress, ornaments, etc., which are all the various *shaktis*, the *abhimaani devataas* of various *tattvaas*. They are all eternally supported by Him, under His control. And *Bhagavaan* who is told as the sole cause of this world, only He is *Shubhaashraya* is being told in this shloka. 



*Bhagavaan's divya mangala vigraha* is *apraakruta*, different from the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, and it is *vilakshana* compared to the world form, *vishvaroopa*. The *pramaanaas* are told here. The colour is told - *aaditya varna*, and is beyond the *tamo loka, prakruti mandala*. The *Paramapada* is *hiranmaya*, it has got that kind of *jyoti*, lustre. It has got a wonderful robe. His eyes are like the broad and fresh petals of a lotus. When one realizes, and gets a vivid perception, it will be not like a dream. The dream that we get is like a defect when tamas increases, whereas, with effort, with *bhakti yoga*, if one achieves that state, then they get a vivid perception. This is like that. It is a gross form. It is great even from the point of view of the *gunaas*, qualities of *Bhagavaan*. This form of *Bhagavaan* is established through various *shruti pramaanaas*.

That which is abode for all the *shaktis*, that form of *Bhagavaan*, is for the good of the world, and is His own sport. Creation and others are all His *leelaa*. These two  [[151]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *shlokaas* tell about *deva, tiryak, manushya, sthaavara* - the four kinds of creation which He does. He also incarnates in all these forms. He acts as though He is also a deva, He is also a *manushya*, He is also a *tiryak*, when he incarnates in these forms. When He incarnates in these forms, He also acts like them, the *cheshtaas*, the acts He does will be similar to them. These are all His *avataara roopaas*. He does these, it is said in these two *shlokaas*. In every *kalpa*, He does fourteen deva *avataaraas*. In each *Manvantara*, He incarnates as a *deva, Vishnu* is one of His *avataaraas* only, among *Chaturmukha Brahma, Rudra, Vishnu*, He is His own *avataara* only. *Matsya, Koorma, Varaaha* are all *tiryak avataaraas. Raama, **Krishna* are *manushya avataaraas*. He does out of His own sport, and not because of any other benefit for Him, for gaining something. There is another *paatha*.

 ***When He incarnates as a human, He acts like a human. We can see this in *Raama* *avataara, Krishna avataara*. It is only for the good of the world that He does that. It is not because He is experiencing the fruits of *karma* done earlier. Because He is *karmaadhyaksha*, and not *karma vashya*. He is *Sarveshvara*, and not like a bound self. This is there in all the *jaatis - deva, manushya*, etc. He is not born like the bound selves here, He incarnates out of His own will. Whatever wonderful acts He did, *leelaa cheshtitaas*, in *Brindaavana, Gokula*, in controlling the *Kaaliya sarpa*, they are unopposed. Nobody can stop Him or oppose Him, or go against Him. *Raavana, Shishupaala, Baana*, and others - nobody can stop or face Him. He overpowers everyone. The *avataaraas* are said to be not *karma nimitta*, not for experiencing the fruits of the *karma*, like the *baddha jeevaas*; the *leelaas* of the Lord do not come under *bhaavanaa traya*, like the bound selves, Because of this, the *avataara roopaas* are also *Shubhaashraya* only.

The *baddha, mukta* forms are all His own form only. They are all His *shareera*, His *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas. Tat roopa* means all His forms, which are *para*, *vyooha, vibhava, antaryaami* and *archaa* - these are the forms to be meditated upon, by one who is engaged in *yoga*. This destroys all the *karmaas* of one. Cleansing of the self means getting rid of the *karmaas*. One who is engaged in *yoga* has to meditate upon that.

One who is performing *yoga*, can establish this kind of a form in his mind, and then can meditate upon it, and this is the form in which *dhaaranaa* is to be done. This is to be established firmly, steadily in the mind. 



That which is the *aadhaara* of all the *shaktis*, the mind has to be established in that during *dhaaranaa*. This is *shuddha dhaaranaa*. This is in order to get *shuddha* *dhaaranaa*.

 ***The reason why the *Shubhaashraya* is beyond the *tribhaavanaa*, is told here. It can be *Shubhaashraya* or *Shuddhaashraya. Bhagavaan* by Himself is *sarvagata*, He is all pervading, and He moves over everywhere. He is everywhere. He is *vyaapta, ananta*. His *svaroopa* itself is *vibhu*. He also moves around everywhere. With respect to something which is totally different, He is *achala*. His *vailakshanya* is told here. He is different and distinct from everything else. That is why He is said to be *Shubhaashraya*. His *avataara roopaas* are also beyond the *bhaavanaa traya*, and also they bestow liberation, moksha. They are *moksha* *kaarana*. Because of this, *shubha* and *aashraya* are both there. They can be meditated upon, and also they bestow the ultimate benefit, *moksha*. This is told in *Smruti* and other places. *Krishna* says in *Bhagavad Geetha* as "One who knows like this". One who establishes his mind on *Nrusimha, Vaamana* - these *avataara* *roopaas* are also *Shubhaashraya* only. In *Saatvata Puraana*, it is said that a man has ten *indriyaas*, and is compared with *Raavana*, who has got ten heads, the manas itself is the *raakshasa*, like *Raavana* - the mind, with the ten sense organs, and with the bow and arrows which is nothing bur *Viveka*, one can control the mind, and just as *Sri Raama* destroyed *Raavana* with the power of His arrows, a *yogi* with *viveka, upaasanaa*, goes forth and controls all these sense organs. He is the one to be meditated upon, and His hue is like the sea. His eyes are blood red, and like a red lotus. He has got bow and arrows. His *Shubhaashraya* is described, and His *avataara roopaas* are all to be meditated upon by a *yogi* in order to get liberated.

All others are *ashuddhaas*, it is said. The *baddha* and *mukta roopaas* told, the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, are all *ashuddhaas*, are *ashubhaashrayaas*, they are different from *bhagavat roopa*. It is told clearly that from *Chaturmukha* Brahma to the lowest being, which are all there in this *prakruti mandala*, which are having a body, and are *baddha*, are all born because of the fruits of experiencing their *karma*. They are all under the sway of *samsaara*, going in the cycle of birth and death. All the *baddha jeevaas* are not fit for *dhyaana* by a *yogi*. They themselves are having *avidyaa, karma*, and they are in *samsaara*, so they cannot be meditated upon by one who is desirous of liberation, *moksha*. Those who have escaped this *samsaara*, and have got rid of all their *karma*, their *jnyaana* is in its proper full state, original state, they have got the *jnyaana*; they are also not useful for one who is engaged in *dhyaana*; because their *jnyaana* is not natural; they were bound selves at one time, and with *Bhagavaan's **anugraha*, His grace, they got rid of this *karma*, and then they became *muktaas*; so the *jnyaana* was always not there for them. So, the *Brahman* who is eternally having *asankuchita* *jnyaana, Satyam jnyaanam anantam Brahma*, is only to be meditated upon, as told by *Shounaka*. This is also told in the *Mahaabhaarata*, that they are all in this *samsaara* only. *Manu, Mahaabhaarata*, and *Puraanaas* are given as *pramaana* here. They are told as *ashuddhaas* because of *karmayonitva*.

Something has to be established in the mind. The mind needs an *aadhaara* for *dhaaranaa*. One has to establish a form in the mind, and then meditate upon it. Without that, it is not possible. What is the form to be established in the mind for *dhyaana*, is now told as the *Bhagavad roopa*, the *divya mangala vigraha*, the most wonderful description of *Bhagavat divya mangala vigraha*.

First, it is said that he has to meditate *Bhagavaan* with all the *astra, bhooshana*. Now, the second kind of meditation is told here.

Then, he has to think of each *avayava* of *Bhagavaan*. This is the fourth dhaaranaa, with the *angaas* of *Bhagavaan*. The *aayudhaas, bhooshanaas*, the various *angaas* of *Bhagavaan*, with the continuous practice and meditation, when it is firmly established in the mind, and then only one *avayava*, having the *Bhagavaan's* form, this is to be meditated upon. This is giving importance to one *avayava* at a time, and then this is told as *dhyaana*. Till this, it is *dhaaranaa*, and now it is *dhyaana*. The *avayavi* is said to be of *gomukhaakaara*, and one has to do *dhyaana* in that.

This is the form of *dhyaana*. When once *dhaaranaa* is established, this is the same as *tailadhaaraavat avicchinna smruti santati roopaa*, what *Bhaashyakaarar* says, that there should be no other thought coming in between two thoughts. This is *saalambana yoga*. In the *astra bhooshana adhyaaya*, the form that is meditated upon, with *astra, bhooshana*, is said to be *sabeeja yoga*. 



The *dhyaana* is now established with the six *angaas - yama, niyama, aasana, **praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa*. Now is told the *dhyaana. Samaadhi* is next.

This is *samaadhi*, said to be *Nirbeeja yoga*. The meditation with *astra, bhooshana* is *Sabeeja yoga*. That which is realized with the *sapta angaas* of *yoga*, up to *dhyaana*, is called *Nirbeeja yoga*, and this is *Bhagavaan's* essential nature. This means, One who is meditated upon with all the *divya mangala vigraha, astra*, *bhooshana* - thinking that He does not have *naama, roopa* like what we see in this world, and that there are not the *shat bhaava vikaaraas, asti iti kevalam*, who is without any *vikaaraas*, with this, the *svaroopa grahana* has to be done. This is to be achieved through meditation in the mind. This is said to be *samaadhi*. The  [[160]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 previous chapter is told as *para vidyaa* and *apara vidyaa. Apara vidyaa* is *shaastra* *janya jnyaana, para vidyaa* is as told in the *Mundakopanishad*, is the *vivekaja* *jnyaana*, which is *upaasanaatmaka*. This is already established in the *Astra **bhooshana adhyaaya* for one who has all these attributes - *astra, bhooshana*, who is *vishishta* with all these things, such a *Bhagavaan* having the *divya mangala* *vigraha*. One can meditate upon the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan*, starting with the meditation on the *divya mangala vigraha*, with all the *astraas* and *bhooshanaas*, the most resplendent form of *Bhagavaan*, and then thinking without the *astraas* thinking about the same form, without the *bhooshanaas* thinking about the same form, and meditating upon the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan*. Always, *Bhagavaan* is qualified by all these things, but the focus is on the *svaroopa, astra, bhooshanaas*; without this, it is not possible to proceed in this form. Without this, it is not possible to achieve. One should not leave them away, but this is the way to progress. Finally, the one who is to be attained, *Bhagavaan*, is qualified by all of these, *astraas, bhooshanaas, vigraha*, as per *Tat kratu nyaaya - "Yathaa **kraturasmin loke purusho bhavati, tathaa itah pretya bhavati*" - "As one meditates, he attains that only; whatever form one meditates upon, he attains that", so if he meditates upon *jeevaatman*, he attains *jeevaatman* only. If one meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, he attains that. *Bhagavaan's* form is having all of these - *divya mangala vigraha, astra, bhooshana*, so meditation is only upon such a form, and not leaving all those things. However, one can focus more and more on various aspects, as what is told in the four ways of *dhaaranaa*. One who attains *Bhagavaan* in the final stage, the ultimate stage, is the *Bhagavaan* having the *divya mangala vigraha*, and the *astra, bhooshana*, etc.

The attainer is *aatman*, and this kind of *vijnyaana*, which is the *saadhanaa* for attaining *Bhagavaan* is told here. This *vijnyaana*, told up to *samaadhi*, this *yoga*, is the one which helps one to attain *Paramaatman*. Just like *Parabrahman*, he will  [[161]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 also be getting rid of all his blemish, his *karma bandha, prakruti sambandha*; he will get rid of *bhaavanaa traya*, the *bhagavat upaasaka* is the attainer. This is also told in the *Shruti* - one who meditates upon *Brahman* attains *Brahman*. The *pramaanaas* about *upaasanaa* are given here.

It is not only that it will lead one to *Brahman*, but also will make one get liberated. *Kshetrajnya* is the *jeevaatman, upaasaka*, who is meditating, is the *karani*. The *karana, saadhana* is *jnyaana*, the *upaasana*. It will definitely give him the fruit of *mukti*, and then only will it return, it is told here. He has to do until he gets *moksha, aharahah anustheya*, this *bhakti yoga* he has to perform everyday, he will attain *moksha*. The *prakruti*, which is *guna traya*, called *maayaa*, in the form of *kshetra*, the *shareera*, his *svaroopa* is covered by that. *Karani* is one who performs the *upaasanaa. Karana*, the instrument is *upaasanaa*, the *samaadhi* *roopa jnyaana*. It will not end before getting him liberation. He has to perform this till he gets liberation. 



It will get him liberation, and he will never return to *samsaara* again. *Kshetrajnya* is one whose real nature is covered by the veil of *prakruti*, and *maayaa* which is *trigunaatmaka*, consisting of *sattva, rajas, tamas*, since beginningless time. *Karani* means one who performs, executes the means to *moksha*. The *jnyaana* of the form of *samaadhi*, is the instrument, the means. It will not get over before he gets liberation. It will take him up to that. This is the power of *samaadhi*, he says. Now, the *moksha svaroopa* is told in the next *shloka*.

This is said to be the *moksha svaroopa. Tadbhaava bhaavam* means *Bhagavaan's* *svabhaava*, which is *apahata paapmatva, vijarah, vimrutyuh, vishokah*, etc. - these will be *aavirbhaava*, that means that these will not be created, but will be in his natural state, because it was covered, like the dust covered on a gem; if the dust is removed, it will shine forth in its original form. He will be not different from *Paramaatman*, he will be in the same form as *Bhagavaan*, He will attain similarity with *Bhagavaan*, is the meaning. *Bheda* is the *deva, manushya* and other forms, which he was in the bound state, because of the ignorance in the form of *karma*, because of which he thought he was *deva, manushya*, etc.; having got rid of all his blemish, he attains similarity with *Paramaatman*, he will be in his original form. Having attained *Paramaatman*, he will get *samaana dharma*, *saadharmya*, with *Bhagavaan. Svaroopa aikya*, identity cannot be told here, because *bhaava bhaava* is told, and the second *bhaava* will be futile in this case, it will not be meaningful. That would again become repetition. One *dravya* cannot become another *dravya*, even when they are mixed together. Though they may be like a river merging into the sea, both are called as sea, as the river leaves its name and form; but the particles of the river are still present, and there is no *svaroopa naasha* or *svaroopa* *aikya* with *samudra*. It becomes one with *samudra* means that it will also have the same form, similarity, that is what is meant here also. These are all explained here. *Abheda* does not mean *svaroopa naasha* and identity with *Bhagavaan*, but it means similarity, *saamya* with *Bhagavaan, guna **saamya*. 



This tells about the *mukti svaroopa*. This is explained in detail by *Sri Engal **Aalwaan. Tadbhaavabhaavan* means the *bhaavaas* of *Parabrahman*, which are *apahata paapmaa, vijarah, vimrutyuh, vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, **satyakaamah, satyasankalpah*, the *ashta gunaas* which are told, which are present in the *jeevaatman* also, in the *upaasaka*, but are covered by the veil of *prakruti*. When the cover is removed, it will be in its original natural state; this is called *aavirbhaava*. So, the *jeevaatman* will also get the *ashta gunaas* like  [[163]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Paramaatman*. He gets *abheda* with *Paramaatman*, his *svaroopa* will also be *jnyaana aananda*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will be equal to that of *Paramaatman*. The *abheda* told here is to be interpreted as told in the commentary - that he becomes similar to Him, becomes similar to *Paramaatman* with the forms of *jnyaana* and *aananda. Jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman* - are they identical or are they different, what happens in the *mukti svaroopa*, is explained. Will the *jeevaatman* lose his *svaroopa* and merge into *Paramaatman*, or will he join *Paramaatman* and get the form similar to *Paramaatman*. This is what is explained here. It is said that there is similarity, and he does not lose his essential nature. There is no *svaroopa naasha* in *moksha*; if it were so, then nobody would desire for such a *moksha. Shrutis* say clearly that there is similarity attained by the *jeevaatman* with *Paramaatman*. The *bheda* is explained - *jeevaatman* is also *jnyaana aananda maya, jnyaana aananda svaroopa*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is eternally having all the good qualities, but due to *prakruti sambandha*, it is covered and contracted. Now, when the *prakruti* *sambandha* goes off, the association with matter is removed and destroyed once and for all, he will be in his original state, which is similar to *Paramaatman*. 



The difference is - when he was associated with *prakruti*, he was born as *deva*, *manushya, tiryak, krimi, keeta, sthaavara*, based on each one's *karma*, which is happening from *anaadi kaala*, beginningless time. The *bheda* came because of the *karma, anaadi karma. Karma* is also *anaadi*. Because *jeevaatman* is *anaadi*, *karma* is also *anaadi*. The *karmaas* which a *jeevaatman* does lead to *Bhagavaan's* *anugraha* or *nigraha*, which are called *punya* and *paapa*, and that is going on getting accumulated. When he transgresses the *shaastraas*, there will be *nigraha*, punishment; *Bhagavaan* will do a *sankalpa* that he has to be punished for this. When he follows the *shaastraas* and does all things right, there will be *anugraha*, and *Paramaatman* will grace him, this is *punya*. The *jeevaatman* has to experience the fruits of all the *karmaas* that he has done. For this he gets bodies, and different kinds of bodies based on the *punya* and *paapa* that he has accumulated. Again, he identifies himself with the body, and again gets into all kinds of *karma*. If he gets into the body of a cow, he will act like a cow, he will do all the *karmaas* like a cow, similarly when he gets into the bodies of a human or *deva*. As when *Keshidhvaja* is teaching *Khaandikya Janaka*, when he gets an *aachaarya* and does *upaasanaa*, he gets rid of this body once and for all, and he will be in his liberated state. Then he will be *abhedi* with *Paramaatman*, similar to *Paramaatman*, because he is also *jnyaana aananda maya*. He is *anu*, his *svaroopa* is *jnyaana aananda*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will become equal to that of *Paramaatman. Deva aadi roopa* is the *bheda* here. This *bheda* is due to *karma* *roopa ajnyaana*. 



 [[164]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 This is told in *Shrutis* as he gets *parama saamya*, ultimate similarity with respect to the *dharma, dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and *apahata paapmatva aadi gunaas*. He will not become *vibhu* in *svaroopa*, he will not be all pervasive in his essential nature, he will be atomic. He will be subtle, and his essential nature will be *ati* *sookshma*. He will not have the capability to enter into all the beings, *antaryaamitva*. He will not be capable of *jagat srushti, paalana, samhaara*. He will enjoy the ultimate bliss similar to that of *Paramaatman*. The similarity is with respect to that aspect only. He will not be tainted by *karma, prakruti*. 



He goes near *Paramaatman*, and touches Him, *sparsha*, and the *paryanka vidyaa* is told in the *Upanishads*. He gets evolved in his original form, and the veil of *karma* is removed. Having attained *Paramaatman*, his *svaroopa aavirbhaava* happens. *Baadaraayana* clearly says this in the *Brahma Sutraas. Bhagavaan **Krishna* says in the *Bhagavad Geeta* that he gets *samaana dharmatva. Svaroopa **aikya* does not happen. There is no *svaroopa naasha*. 



The defects in the other proposition are told. If there is *svaroopa aikya*, the words told here *tadbhaava bhaavam*, the second *bhaava* will be meaningless. If there is *svaroopa aikya*, only one *bhaava* would be sufficient. So, there is no identity, there is only similarity. *Abhedi bhavati* would also become repetition. The meaning of *yoga* given in the other proposition is identity, where *jeevaatma* *svaroopa* merges into *Paramaatma svaroopa* and loses its *svaroopa*; that cannot be true, because as told in the *Vishnu Puraana* itself earlier, one object cannot become another object. 



When there is merger of two objects, they maintain their *svaroopa*, but they can become one, as in if we add one-half tumbler of water into another half-tumbler of water, both will become water only. If a river merges into the sea, they will both be called sea only, we say that they merge into each other; but the particles, atoms of the river will still remain there only, and will not get destroyed in the ocean. But, it may lose its name and form which was there earlier. Similarly, *jeevaatman* also loses his name and form which *deva, manushya*, etc., and will attain a state similar to *Paramaatman* with respect to his *jnyaana aananda* *gunaas*. There will be contradictions with the *Shruti* statements if we don't say so. This is the *mukti svaroopa*. 



There are some more important *shlokaas* coming next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching *Khaandikya Janaka* about *Bhagavat yoga, upaasanaa*, how *dhyaana* is to be done to attain *samaadhi*. He was telling that such a kind of *bhakti yoga*, will definitely get one *moksha*, liberation.  [[165]] of 194

The *moksha svaroopa* is only explained here. The differences with respect to *deva, manushya*, etc., his *karma* gets completely destroyed when he sees *Paramaatman* and goes and joins Him. The *ajnyaana*, ignorance of the nature of *karma*, is the cause of various differences like various forms of *deva, manushya*, etc. When that is destroyed completely with the *darshana* of *Paramaatman*, with the *aatman* being *jnyaanaika roopa* itself, then who will say that he is *deva*, or he is *manushya*, then the *aatma Paramaatma saamya* with respect to *jnyaana* *aakaaratva svaroopa* and in the *jnyaana dharma*, the similarity will be there. That *jeevaatman* is *anu*, and *Paramaatman* is *vibhu* will remain, but both will be of the nature of consciousness. One will not differentiate like *deva, manushya*. *Shounaka's* words are also told as *pramaana* here. The four kinds of *bheda* told here - *deva, manushya, tiryak, sthaavara*, is because of the *ajnyaana* which is happening due to *karma*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Khaandikya* replied - O *Keshidhvaja*, with your teaching of this *yoga*, everything is done. I am happy, there is nothing else I want. With this *upadesha* instruction of yours, all the impurities in my mind are completely destroyed now. I have nothing else to ask of you. 



He shows the indication that he has absorbed the knowledge, which *Keshidhvaja* has taught him. He said that "My mind has become pure".

I said "My, mine, that I have heard everything, my mind has now been cleared". These words "I, mine", without using these words, I cannot convey you these. That is why I told, and not with any other reason. I have lost this *ahamkaara*, *mamakaara*. If I tell that my mind is pure, then it may mean that I still have *ahamkaara*, but that is not what I am meaning here. I am not having any *ahamkaara, mamakaara*. When the impurities are all destroyed, I still have to tell that "My mind". When the complete impurities are destroyed, I should not even be using *aham, mama*, but those who have understood the truth, and are trying to tell, even those who have realized the ultimate, cannot convey this without using those words. That is why I am using that, he says.

*Aham, mama* are *avidyaa jnyaana*, thinking one as something else. He is a man, she is a woman, this is a cow, horse, is also *avidyaa*, it is not the right knowledge, because all are *jnyaana aakaaraas, aatmans* only. All the differences, what I said, are due to *avidyaa* only, *bhramaa*. It is the wrong knowledge. The truth is that *aatman* is eternal, and we cannot express by words. We cannot talk about him. We cannot say that this *aatman* is goat, this is buffalo, etc; we cannot use these words to indicate an *aatman*. Because all *aatmans* are *jnyaana aakaaraas* only. He cannot be told using these words. Because these are all coming due to *prakruti* *sambandha* and not in his real nature.

Concentrating on *Bhagavaan* only, with *yama, niyama, aasana*, etc., having perfected all of that, he merged into *Vishnu*, who is *nirmala, Parabrahman*. 



The meaning of *laya* is told in the commentary. *Laya* is the complete destruction of the *naama, roopa, karma*. He got this when he attained *Vishnu*. This is told in the *Shrutis*. Just like the rivers. The river is called *Gangaa*, and it has a form, that it is flowing like this, and that is *Yamunaa* river, this is *Kaaveri* river, etc., and they all go and merge into the ocean. When they go into the ocean, inside the ocean, we cannot say that "this is river *Gangaa*, this is river *Kaaveri*, this is river *Yamunaa*". They leave their form and name and merge into the ocean. But they don't lose their essential nature. Similarly, *jeevaatman* attains *moksha*, in the same way. 



Just as a horse shakes off its mane, similarly, the *jeevaatman* shakes off all his *punya* and *paapa karmaas* and attains liberation. The knots in the heart, the *raaga, dvesha, karma*, everything gets destroyed. Being untainted by *karma*, he attains ultimate similarity with *Paramaatman*. These are all told in the *Shrutis*. There is no *svaroopa aikya*, it is not identity of nature, *jeevaatman* does not lose his essential nature. This is also seen clearly in the *nitya, naimittika* and *praakruta* *laya*. It is told that in *sushupti*, deep sleep, we go and attain *Paramaatman*, we get *laya*; it is said that *jeevaatman* merges into *Paramaatman* in deep sleep, but he again comes back, he becomes the same thing whatever he was earlier, when he wakes up; and he remembers all the things that he remembered earlier, whatever he had done the previous day; he becomes whatever he was earlier; this is proof that he has not lost his essential nature, because he again comes back. Like this, it can be seen in *naimittika* and *praakruta pralaya*. 



If the *jeevaatman* had lost his nature, what would have happened? When he dies, for example, and gets into another body, when a human dies and gets born as a  [[169]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 horse or cow, he will become the cow or horse only to experience the fruits of his *karma*, and he will get body of a cow or a horse. If the nature of *jeevaatman* itself gets totally destroyed when he dies, and if he gets into the body of a cow, then he will have to experience *karmaas* which he had not done, because his nature would have been destroyed completely and created again. Or whatever good or bad things he would have done in his human life, will not be giving fruit at all if he loses his nature completely. This is called *kruta vipranaasha*, the fruits of the *karma* done will get destroyed if his nature gets completely destroyed; or he will have to experience the fruits of *karmaas* he has not done; this is not as per *shaastraas*, and this is not true. We experience the fruits of acts that we have done only, and not otherwise. 



If this were not true, then *Eeshvara* also will have the defects, because if a *jeevaatman* gets into the body of a cow, and someone becomes a human, someone becomes a *deva*, why should *Eeshvara* create like this, if all of them lost their essential nature, and if it was newly created? This differentiation, *vaishamya*, will be a defect on the part of *Eeshvara*. And also there will be *nairghrunya*, because some of them will experience grief all the time, some of them will experience happiness; why should *Paramaatman* subject someone to grief for no reason, there would be cruelty on the part of *Brahman*. Whereas *Brahman* is told to be without any defects, *akhila heya pratyaneekatva*, His nature is far from any defects. He does not have any defects, as also told in the *Sutraas*. 



So, *jeevaatman's anaadi karma* is only responsible, and *jeevaatmans* are also there from beginningless time. They get their bodies as per their *karmaas*, and they experience grief or happiness, and *Eeshvara* is only a creator. *Eeshvara* does the act of creation, but choosing the body is based on their *karmaas* only. All this will be proper only if *jeevaatmans* do not lose their essential nature. If they lose their essential nature itself, then none of these will be right. There would be a lot of contradictions in the *shaastraas* then. 



In the *Aatyantika laya, moksha*, he will not get another body. This is the difference compared to *nitya, naimittika, praakruta laya*, where he will be again in this *samsaara* and will get another body, again and again, whereas in the *Aatyantika laya, moksha*, he will never return to *samsaara* again.

*Keshidhvaja*, for the purpose of liberation, in order to destroy all his *karmaas* which were there, he performed acts without any desire for fruits therein, and with the *mamataa tyaaga, kartrutva tyaaga, sambandha tyaaga, phala tyaaga*, without any desire in the fruits, and with *Bhagavat aaraadhana roopa*. And he also enjoyed based on the *karma*, without any attachment, because it has to be destroyed. The *praarabdha karmaas*, which have started to give fruits, have to be experienced. But there should be no attachment to any of that. If something bad happens, he will experience it, but he will not have any attachment to the fruits. If something good happens also, he will experience without any attachment. *Keshidhvaja* was doing like this.

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****अकल्याण * *****इतत * | *****अमलः * *****िवपतप्रारब्र्कमगववशेषः * | ***



Having got destroyed all the *praarabdha karmaas*, which had started to give fruit already, and which cannot be avoided, having experienced them, and having got rid of all the *paapaas* having experienced them, which had already started to give fruits, having become *amala*, having got his *praarabdha karma* destroyed fully, then he became eligible for *atyanta siddhi*, liberation. 



This completes Chapter Seven.

Now, Chapter Eight. This is mostly about the *phala*, and what was told in the entire *Vishnu Puraana*, is summarized by *Paraasharar* here. *Paraasharar* also tells  [[171]] of 194

The three groups what I have learnt are those responsible for creation, sustenance and dissolution - 1. *Brahma, Daksha Prajaapati* and others, who are responsible for creation, 2. *Vishnu*, who Himself does His *avataara*, *Manu*, who do sustenance, 3. *Rudra, Kaala* who are responsible for dissolution. I have come to know these three groups.

With your grace, I have learnt everything. This is sufficient for me. There is nothing else to know. What is that I have known is that this entire world is not different from *Paramaatman, Vishnu*.

Nothing can exist separately from *Vishnu*, because they are inseparably associated with Him, and He is the inner self of everything. This is what I have known.

The greatness of *Vishnu naama sankeertana*, without one's knowledge, or in whatever state he is, when the mind is not in control also, if we just chant His names, that itself will make one get rid of all the sins. A comparison is given - the deer which has come near a lion, and which is very terrified, if it is saved from the lion, and taken to safety, how much comfort it feels; like that, we have accumulated sins from beginningless time, all our sins will get destroyed just by chanting the sacred divine names of *Sri Mahaavishnu*. 



The greatness of the *naama sankeertana*, will be told next. The *phala* of listening to this and studying this work will be told. Which we see next. 



With the grace of *Bhagavaan Sri Vishnu* and our *Aachaaryaas*, we have been able to study this work, and now is the concluding session, and *Mangalaacharane*. We will listen to the *phalashruti* that *Sri Paraasharar* is going to tell. 



We are studying Chapter 8 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is telling Sri *Maitreyar* what all he has told so far, what all is being taught in this *Sri Vishnu* *Puraanam* - everything about the sacred land of India, the whole earth *Pruthivi*, the lands, the sacred rivers, the mountains, the stories of lives of great people, great kings and rishis, what all wonderful acts they did during their lifetime, what all we can learn from them, and many people eulogized *Sri Mahaavishnu* as we can see, and the *sarveshvaratva, sarvashaktitva, sarvaniyantrutva* of *Sri* *Mahaavishnu*, how everything is created, sustained, and dissolution also, which happens by Him only, and also about *varna aashrama dharmaas*, about *Vedashaastraas* - how it was one, and then divided into four, and then propagated through the *aachaarya shishya paramparaa* - all this is present here, as *Sri Paraasharar* is telling. He will tell about the greatness of *naama* *sankeertana*, and also the various *phalaas* which come to one who listens and propagates this.

Because of the *varadaana* of *Pulastya*, I also remembered this. I have taught you as it is, O *Maitreya*. 



The story of *Pulastya* and *Vasishtha*, we saw in the very beginning, where *Pulastya* and *Vasishtha* come to *Paraasharar* and they give him the boon of *Bhagavat yaathaatmya jnyaana*, and he will know all the *Puraanaas*. How *Paraasharar* also got this through *sampradaaya*, is explained in the commentary. Earlier, it was told that Saarasvata only taught this. Based on this, he says that he learnt this. In the *Kruta yuga*, all the *Puraanaas* were connected together, and it was called Brahma *Puraana, Brahma samjnyaa. Chaturmukha Brahma* gave this to *Daksha*, and like this, it came up to *Purukutsa. Paraasharar* in *Treta yuga*, collected the *Vishnu* *Puraana*, and there was a lot of time loss, a lot of gap in between, and it got lost in between. Again, *Paraasharar* through his *tapas*, he did *saakskaatkaara* of this, and that was being obtained by *Chaturmukha* *Brahma*, was taught through *Rubhu* and *Jaaturkarna*. This is another *sampradaaya*. Again it was propagated in *triloka*. What is told here, from *Chaturmukha Brahma*, through *Rubhu*, etc., is another *sampradaaya*. In the 28th *yuga*, where *Maitreyar* is asking *Paraasharar*, and in the previous *janma* of *Paraasharar*, he had learnt it from *Saarasvata*, and in this birth, *Paraasharar* through *Vasishtha* and *Pulastya's* *varadaana*, he remembered it again, a small part of it only, and became reduced  [[184]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 in size. So, there is no *sampradaaya viccheda*. Through *Paraasharar* only, it came first, and through *Chaturmukha Brahma*, what *Paraasharar* had done *saakskaatkaara*, that only was taught to *Rubhu* and others. So, there is no *sampradaaya viccheda*, no break in the *sampradaaya. Sri Paraasharar*, when he was in the womb of his mother itself, remembered the *Veda mantraas*. The story says that *Vasishthar* wanted to end his life, as he was feeling very sad that there was nobody to continue his *vamsha*, when his son was killed by *raakshasaas*. At that time, he heard a *Vedamantra*, and his daughter-in-law, his son *Shakti's* wife, said that she was pregnant. *Paraasharar*, when in the womb itself knew the *Vedamantraas*. He remembered the *Vedaas* heard in some other *janma*, in the *garbha* itself. In the same way, he can remember the *Puraanaas* also. How *Puraana kartrutva* is obtained by *Sri Paraasharar* is told as - In the 26th *yuga*, he became a *Vyaasa*, it has come from there, and through *Pulastya vara*, he taught it. That is how he became the *kartaa* of *Sri Vishnu Puraana*.

One who has fixed his mind on *Bhagavaan Vishnu*, who is meditating on Him, the joy of meditation, and thinking of *Bhagavaan*, in front of that, even svarga is an obstruction only, and even the *Brahma loka* is very meagre for one who has established the Lord in his mind, will get moksha itself. There is nothing surprising that when one does the *naama sankeertana* of *Bhagavaan*, all the sins will get totally destroyed. 



The meaning of *mati* is *shravana, manana*, the knowledge out of these. *Chintana* means *dhaarana*, what is told in *yoga. Dhyaana* is also told, controlling the mind inside. Next comes *Samaadhi*. One who does all these will get *moksha* itself. There is nothing surprising that all his sins will get destroyed completely, for one who meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, and does *naama sankeertana*.

Those who are knowledgeable about performing *yajnyaas*, they are *karma* *nishthaas*. They worship *Bhagavaan Vishnu* as *Yajnyeshvara*, all the time with various *yajnyaas*. The *jnyaanis*, the knowledgeable ones, they meditate upon Him, for whom the whole world, *para* and *avara* are His form, or as *Brahman* Himself. One who meditates upon Him, will not be born again, and will not die, and there will be no contraction or expansion of knowledge. Coming into contact with the body is birth, and leaving it is death - these will not be there. No cause and effect will be there; there will be no more birth. This can also be explained for *Bhagavaan*, that there is no cause for Him, just as we see here where the cause undergoes modification and becomes a *kaarya. Bhagavaan* is the immutable  [[187]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 principle. *Bhagavaan* is also the *kaarana* and *kaarya* for the whole world, and He does not undergo any modification like the normal things which we see here. What one should listen to, beyond Hari? There is nothing beyond *Bhagavaan **Hari*, for anyone to even listen to, His *gunagaana* and His *keertana*.

*Bhagavaan* is without beginning and without end. According to *Veda*, whatever is told, in the *vidhi*, they offer *kavya* to *pitrus*, and *Bhagavaan* only receives that in the form of *pitrus*, being *antaryaami* of everything. Whatever is offered as *svadhaa*, whatever is offered to *devataas* by telling *svaahaa*, that *havya*, that also, He only is the ultimate *phalee*, being the *antaryaami* of *devaas* also. He is all pervading, *Vibhu*. The *Parabrahman*, in the actual meaning, in the prime sense, the word *Brahma* denotes *Bhagavaan* only. Because it is *bruhatva* through *svaroopa* and *guna*, and everything *bruhat, Brahma*. He is the one who is abode of all the *shaktis*. One who follows the various *pramaanaas*, the *pratyaksha* cannot show *Bhagavaan*, we cannot perceive Him through *anumaana*, we cannot perceive Him through *shabda* also, because He is *Ananta*, we cannot know fully. All the *pramaanaas* are not sufficient to grasp *Bhagavaan's svaroopa*, and *gunaas*, because they are endless and He is all-pervading. Because of this, only *Hari's* sacred divine name, and all His wonderful acts, are to be listened to, and eulogized by anyone. 





Through the next four *shlokaas*, the conclusion of the *shaastra* is made. Sri *Paraasharar* is doing *namana* to *Bhagavaan* who is present in four forms, in His own divine auspicious form. *

For performing *mangala*, that all auspicious things should happen, Sri *Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan* who is in the form of *Eeshvara* \(His own form\), *Purusha* \(all the *chetanaas*\), *Pradhaana* \(as *avyakta*, unmanifest matter, *achit*\), *Vyakta* \(as manifest matter\). The first *shloka* of these four, is about *Bhagavaan's* divine auspicious form, which was explained wonderfully in the *Astra Bhooshana adhyaaya*, and by *Keshidhvaja*, about how one has to meditate. *Kaala* is also included in Him. 



He is *aadi anta rahita*, without beginning or end. He does not have *vruddhi*, *parinaama, apakshaya* \(growth, modification, decline\) - the *shat bhaava* *vikaaraas*. He is immutable, unchangeable principle. He is the supreme ruler of all. He is one who is worth eulogizing, *keertana, praarthana*. His name itself is *Purushottama*, He is *uttamah purushah tu anyah*. I bow down to Him. * *We have been graced by our *Aachaaryaas* and *Bhagavaan* to study this wonderful sacred work. So, it is *mangala* for everyone. For this, at the end, *Sri Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan*.

Now, *Sri Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan*, who is present in the form of all the *chetanaas*. He is present in the form of *chetanaas*, all *chetanaas* are His *shareera. Anugunabhuk* means *sheshabhoota*, that they are all subservient to Him. He is One, without any differentiation of *deva, manushya*, etc. He is *jnyaanaikasvaroopa*. When He comes into contact with *prakruti, achetana*, He  [[189]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 will be a *baddha jeeva*, a *samsaari*. Though He is in His real nature, pure and untainted, because of the contact with *prakruti*, because of *karmaas*, He looks as though He is *ashuddha*, impure. Because a *baddha jeeva* thinks that whatever body he is in, that itself is the *aatma*, through *dehaatma bhramaa*, so He looks like *ashuddha*. One *asaadhaarana dharma* of *jeevaatman* is *jnyaaatrutva*, that he has *dharma bhoota jnyaana*., and this is also *svaroopa niroopaka dharma* for him. The *srushti* happens because the *chetanaas* have to experience the fruits of their karma, punya and *paapa. Prakruti* modifies to *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc., by *Bhagavaan's sankalpa*. This is told as *tattva vibhooti kartaa*. These are done by *Bhagavaan* only, because of the *punya paapa* of the *purushaas*. One who does all these is the creator of the world. The *chetanaas* of the world are also His *shareera. Bhagavaan*, who is having the *chetanaas*, who have all these qualities, as His *shareera*, to Him, I bow down. 



The *chetana*, who is *sheshabhoota*, who is *shuddha*, but looks like *ashuddha* when he is in contact with *deva, manushya*, and other *shareeraas*, who has *jnyaaatrutva*, and whose *punya paapa karmaas* are all responsible for all this creation, to *Bhagavaan* who is having such *chetanaas* as His body, His *shareera*, and who is immutable, I bow down to Him always.

The *sattva, rajas, tamas kaaryaas* - the *kaarya* of *tamas* is contraction of knowledge, or obstruction; when *sattva, rajas, tamas* are all in one place, and when they are in equal state, they are called as *avyakta*. When in *pralaya*, the *moola prakruti* is *avyakta*, it is said. *Avyakta shareeraka Paramaatman* is the meaning here. *Prakruti* is responsible for the experiences of all the *chetanaas*, of *punya, paapa*, etc. One who is having the *trigunaatmaka prakruti* as His shareera. He is told as *avyaakruta. Karma*, which is the cause of *samsaara*, and He is the cause of this *karma*, because His *anugraha, nigraha* will cause *punya, paapa*. He is  [[190]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 the one who decides the *punya, paapa* for the *chetanaas* based on their *karmaas*. *Brahma sutraas* say " *aatmakruteh*", that "I will become many", " *bahusyaam*". He is without any beginning, He is there all the time, existing all the time by Himself. This is *Bhagavaan's* form of *avyakta*. 



First is told the divine auspicious form, then *chetana-shareeraka Paramaatman*, then *avyakta-shareeraka Paramaatman*. Next comes *vyakta shareeraka **Paramaatman*. There is nothing which is not *Bhagavadaatmaka*.

This is the *vyakta roopa* of *Paramaatman. Aakaasha, anila, agni, jala, pruthivi*, the five elements of the world, He is only present as *antaryaami*. He is present in those forms. Through *shareera-shareeri bhaava*, the words which connote the *shareera* also go up to the *shareeri*. All the words, through *aparyavasaana vrutti*, all connote *Bhagavaan* only. Everything is *Bhagavaan*, being His *shareera*. He is capable of making all the sense objects which are the objects of enjoyment, through the sense organs for the *chetanaas*, the *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, **gandha*, the objects of enjoyment; and He does *upakaara* to all the *chetanaas*, through all the *indriyaas*. This is the manifest form of *Bhagavaan. Sookshma* form is *mahat* and other things which are in very subtle form. *Bruhat* are *pruthivi*, and others which are being seen. He is the *aatma, antaryaami* of all that. All are His form only. 



*Bhagavaan* is having all the manifest forms of all these as His *shareera*. He is present in those forms being the *aatma, antaryaami*. I bow down to Him. 



In the above four *shlokaas*, the four forms are shown. This shows that everything is *Bhagavaan's* form, that everything is Bhagavadaatmaka.

The *chetana, achetana vastu* means that it is a real object, it is real, the reality principle. He is having everything as His *shareera* means the three relationships, that they are all supported by Him, all are controlled by Him, they are all subservient to Him. He is the Lord of all, He is the *Purushottama. Paraasharar* is blessing all the *chetanaas*, that everyone should get *moksha*. This is the greatness of our sages. *Paraasharar*, with so much of *kaarunya*, is blessing everyone that everyone should get *moksha*. He is completing this *Puraana* like this. As told in all these six *amshaas. Prakruti, para, aatma maya - prakruti* is *vyakta, avyakta* - the manifest and unmanifest; and that which is superior to that is *apraakruta, para*, His divine auspicious form; and *aatma* is all the *chetanaas. Bhagavaan* is *sanaatana*. For all the *chetanaas*, let Him give the *siddhi* which is without any birth and death, the cycle of *samsaara* - let Him give the ultimate liberation, moksha. All the *prakruti, vyakta, avyakta*, are the form of Him only, the unborn; they are His *roopa* only, His *shareera*. Everything are told as Him only, through *saamaanaadhikaranya*, because of the *shareera-shareeri bhaava*. There are many *chetanaas*, there is *aatma bahutva*, and there is *paraspara bheda*, and every *aatman* is different from the other, though they are of similar *svaroopa, jnyaana **svaroopa*. Because *Paraasharar* is praying *Bhagavaan* to grant moksha to everyone, this shows that *Bhagavaan Sri Vishnu* only is the bestower of *moksha*, liberation, and He is *moksha prada*. 



He is *sakala itara samasta vilakshana*. All *chetana achetana vastu* is His *shareera*. *Chetanaas* are many, and everything is real. He is *moksha prada*. Because He is *antaryaami* of everything, and everything is His *shareera*, there is *saamaanaadhikaranya* told that everything is Him only. All this is told here. This is the summary of this *shaastra*. 



*Prakruti* and *Purusha* are different from *Parabrahman*.

This completes *Sri Vishnu Puraanam*. 



With this, the *Vishnuchitteeya*, the commentary by *Sri Vishnuchittar*, or *Sri Engal **Aalwaan*, this most wonderful commentary gets completed. We can see from this commentary that all the *Vishnu Puraana shlokaas* given in the *Sri Bhaashya*, the *Mahaasiddhaanta* part, where *Bhaashyakaarar* has not commented on many *shlokaas*, but has given *udaaharana* of these, at all those places, *Sri Sudarshana* *Suri* has explained these *shlokaas* with the help of *Sri Engal Aalwaan's* *vyaakhyaana* only. *Sri Engal Aalwaan's shishya* was *Sri Nadaadoorammaal*, whose shishya was *Sri Sudarshana Suri. Sri Sudarshana Suri*, what he listened in the *kaalakshepa* from *Sri Nadaadoorammaal*, which is *Shrutaprakaashika*. In this *Shrutaprakaashika*, he enlightens all the *Vishnu Puraana shlokaas* by taking from *Sri Engal Aalwaan's vyaakhyaana* only. So, this is a very very important commentary, very important work for us. *Sri Vishnu Puraana* is quoted profusely by *Sri Bhaashyakaarar* in *Sri Bhaashya*, and in *Vedaarthasangraha*. 



We were really fortunate to study this *Sri Vishnu Puraana*. It was a great opportunity to study this work.
