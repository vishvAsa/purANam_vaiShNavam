Similarly *sadaachaara*. This was explained. In the Fourth *Amsha*, those who established this *varna aashrama dharma*, details of those *vamshaas * are going to be told. The *Soma, Soorya vamsha*, will all betold. *

He has got *shubha aashraya, **divya mangala vigraha*, divine auspicious form. He does not have the shat *bhaava vikaaraas - asti, jaayate, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, **nashyati*. How can we know, call Him? He is always existing, in any form. How did *Khatvaanga* unite with the *Paramaatman*, is explained here. This is told in the *Upanishads*, as per the injunction given in the *Shrutis*, that one has to offer oneself to *Bhagavaan*. That *Purusha* is itself the *havis*.

They say that "Our Indra is only *Prahlaada*, and for that reason only, I am fighting the gods, so that *Prahlaada* can become the Indra". They did not accept *Raji's* offer that he wanted to become Indra. They went back being disappointed. After that, the gods approached Raji, and asked him the same thing - "Can you please help us and fight on our side, we want to win over the *daityaas*". The gods agreed to his condition. "We agree to your condition that if we win over the *daityaas*, you will be the Indra". * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 9: रिजना अिप देव सै� सहायेन अनेकैः महा अ�ैः तत् अशेषम् असुर बलम् िनदूिषतम् ॥ ९ ॥ *Raji* helped the army of *devaas*, and using variety of weapons, the demons were destroyed. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 10: अथ िजत अ�र प�ः च देवे�ो रिज चरणयुगलम् आ�नः िशरसा िनपी� आह ॥ १० ॥ After winning, *Indra* went and fell at the feet of *Raji*, and then he says thus. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 11: भय त्राणात् अ�दानात् भवान् अ�त् िपता अशेष लोकानाम् उ�मो�मो भवान् य� अहं पुत्रः ित्रलोके�ः ॥ ११ ॥ He says - "You protected me from this fear of the *daityaas* and have given us food, you are my father, you are the most supreme in all the worlds, I am now your son; I was the *Indra*, and I am now your son". Then the king understood what he meant. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 12: स च अिप राजा प्रह� आह ॥ १२ ॥ The king smiled and said thus. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 13: एवम् अ�ु एवम् अ�ु अनितक्रमणीया िह वै�र प�ात् अिप अनेक िवध चाटु वा� गभा� प्रणितः इित उ�ा � पुरं जगाम ॥ १३ ॥ He said - "Let it be so, let it be so, I understood your tricky words, I understood your trick.

You have to win over kingdoms, but not accept from one who has fallen at your feet. This is the *raaja* *dharma*. So he did not accept. This is why *Indra* fell at his feet, as he did not want to give that. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 14: शतक्रतुः अिप इ��ं चकार ॥ १४ ॥ Shatakratu became the *Indra*, as usual. He retained his position. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 15: �या�ते तु रजौ नारदिष� चोिदता रिज पुत्राः शतक्रतुम् आ� िपतृ पुत्रं समाचारात् रा�ं यािचतव�ः ॥ १५ ॥ Once *Raji* passed away, *Naarada* comes to *Raji's* sons and tells that they are entitled as their father has won over the *Indra* *padavi*, and returned back to him, go and ask him; and they go to *Shatakratu*, *Indra*, and say that "We are the actual sons of *Raji*, we are entitled to this position as he has won over that and has given to you, this is our birthright". They ask Indra to give the position back. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: �या�त इित | आचरात् िपतृदयाद �ायात् | * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 16: अप्रदानेन च िविज� इ�म् अितबिलनः �यम् इ��म् चक्रुः ॥ १६ ॥ They were very powerful. *Indra* did not agree to give. They defeated him and got the *Indra* *padavi*. They won over him. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 17: ततः च ब�ितथे काले िह अतीते बृह�ितम् एका�े �ष्�ा अप�त त्रैलो� य� भागः शतक्रतुः उवाच ॥ १७ ॥ *Indra*, because nobody was offering *havis* to him, whatever *havis* was offered, was going to whoever was sitting in the *Indra* *padavi*, *Raji's* sons; *Shatakratu* was deprived of his *havir* *bhaaga*; when he was roaming around, after a long time, he saw *Bruhaspati* alone. Then he tells him. * * [[122]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 18: बदरीफलमात्रम् अिप अह�िस समा�ायनाय पुरोडाश ख�ं दातुम् इित उ�ो बृह�ितः उवाच ॥ १८ ॥ O *Bruhaspati*, do something so that at least I get a purodaasha, havis, at least of the quantity of *Badari* *phala* \( *elachi* *hannu*, ಎಲ� ಹಣು� in *Kannada*\). Why can't you help me in this.

I will definitely do very soon, within a few days, you will get your position back". Then, everyday he started to do *aabhichaarika* *karma*. These *karmaas* are told in Atharva *Veda*, *Shyena* *yaaga*. These *karmaas* he did in order to get *buddhi* *moha*, in order to do delusion to the *Indra* who was presently there, Raji's son, and also to increase the *tejas* of *Shatakratu*, the *Indra* who was there earlier. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पुरोधसा अिप यजमान चोिदतेन एव का�ं कम� कत��ं न तु अ�था , तत् इ�या अ�ात�ािद�िभप्रे� आह यिद एवम् इित | If *kaamya* *karmaas* are to be done, whoever is the *Bruhaspati*, for the king, he should not do by himself, unless he is asked by the king. *Bruhaspati* has to be requested specifically by the *yajamaana*, that he wants to do this *kaamya* *karma*, otherwise he will not do by himself. *Bruhaspati* did not know this desire, as *Indra* did not explicitly ask him. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 20: ते च अिप तेन बु�� मोहेन अिभभूयमान ब्र�ि�षो धम� �ािगनो वेद वाद पराङ्मुखा बभूवुः ॥ २० || Because of the effect of the *aabhichaarika* *karma*, they \( *Raji's* sons\) had *buddhi* *moha*, they were confused, did not know what is dharma, what is *adharma*, they started hating *Brahmins*, and gave up *dharma*, and were opposed to whatever is told in the *Vedaas*. They gave up *dharma*, and were opposed to whatever *Veda* says. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 21: ततः तान् अपेतधमा�चरान् इ�ो जघान ॥ २१ ॥  [[123]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 Because they lost all the *dharma* *aacharane*, their *tejas* reduced, and *Indra's* *tejas* having increased, he killed all of them. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 22: पुरोिहत आ�ाियत तेजाः च शक्रो िदवम् आक्रमत् ॥ २२ ॥ With the increased *tejas* that *Indra* got, because of the *aabhichaarika* karma which the *purohita* *Bruhaspati* did, he occupied his position back. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 23: एतत् इ�� �पद �वनात् आरोहणं श्रु�ा पु�षः �पद भ्रंशं दौरा�ं च ना�ोित ॥ २३ ॥ One who listens to the story of how Indra lost his position, and again regained it back, such a person will never lose his position. He will also not become wicked. He will always be good. This is the *phala* for one who listens to this story. **

Desire can never be satisfied. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 25: यदा न कु�ते भावं सव�भूतेषु पापकं | सम��ेः तदा पुंसः सवा�ः सुखमया िदशः ॥ २५ ॥ When, in all the beings, one does not have a bad feeling, he will have *samadrushti*, he will be equally disposed towards everyone, and at that time, he will have all round happiness. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: यदा इित | पापकं राग�ेषािद | * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 26: या दु� जा दुम�ितिभः या न जीय�ित जीय�तः | तां तृ�ां सं�जेत् प्रा�ः सुखेन एव अिभपूय�ते ॥ २६ ॥ That which cannot be given up by bad people, wicked people, and even when you become old, that which does not become old, \(as a person becomes old also, the desire does not get old, it remains young\), that desire one has to give up completely.

If he gives up desire, without any difficulty he will become a complete person. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 27: जीय��� जीय�तः केशाः द�ा जीय��� जीय�तः | धन आशा जीिवताशा च जीय�तो अिप न जीय�तः ॥ २७ ॥ As one gets old, hairs become old and they fall; teeth also become weak and old.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 अतः परं ययातेः प्रथम पुत्र� यदोः वंशम् अहं कथयािम ॥ १ ॥ *Sri Paraasharar - Yayaati's* first son *Yadu*, his *vamsha*, I will tell you, *Yadu* *vamsha*. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 2: यत्र अशेष लोक िनवासो मनु� िस� गंधव� य� रा�स गु�क िकंपु�ष अ�र उरग िवहग दै� दानव आिद� �द्र वसु अि� म�त् देविष�िभः मुमु�ुिभः धम� अथ� काम मो�ािथ�िभः च तत् तत् फल लाभाय सदा अिभष्टुतो अप�र�े� माहा� अंशेन भगवान् अनािद िनधनः िव�ुः अवततार ॥ २ ॥ This tells about *Krishna avataara*, this is just a mention here, later on it will come in detail.

He was in His own nature. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 3: अत्र �ोकः ॥ ३ ॥ This is praised in a *shloka*. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 4: यदोः वंश नरः श्रु�ा सव� पापैः प्रमु�ते | यत्र अवतीण� कृ�ा�ं परं ब्र� नराकृित ॥ ४ ॥  [[131]] of 249

The greatness of *Balaraama* is - with his intoxicated eyes rolling, if He immediately looks at the enemy army, immediately all of them will lose their powers and they run away; they cannot face even His eyes rolling with anger. The very look of His eyes will scare away all the enemies. He can destroy enemy armies like an elephant. The *Halaayudha* is such a powerful weapon that it can kill even powerful enemies, like an elephant.

Along with the *Bhojaas, Akroora* went and ran away from *Dwaarakaa*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 112: तत् अपक्रा�� िदनात् आर� तत्र उपसग� दुिभ�� �ाल अनावृि� मा�रकािद उपद्रवा बभूवुः ॥ ११२ ॥ The moment *Akroora* left *Dwaarakaa*, the effect of the *Syamantaka Mani* was not there anymore. All kinds of diseases, famine, fear of snakes, lack of rains, dry season, pandemics, all started to happen in *Dwaarakaa*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 113: अथ यादवा बलभद्र उग्रसेन समवेता म�म् अम�यन् ॥ ११३ ॥ *Yaadavaas*, along with *Balabhadra, Ugrasena*, started to think why such a thing has happened. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 114: भगवान् उरग अ�रकेतनः िकम् इदम् एकदा एव प्रचुर उपद्रव आगमनम् एतत् आलो�ताम् इित उ�े अ�क नामा यदुवृ�ः प्राह ॥ ११४ ॥ Then *Garudadhvaja, Bhagavaan Sri Krishna*, asked all the *Yaadavaas*, - "What is this, we have such calamities, and the whole area is having so many difficulties, what is the reason, let us think about it". There was an old *Yadu* person called *Andhaka*, he said thus. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: भगवान् इित | एतत् िकम् इित अ�यः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 115: अ� अक्रूर� िपता �फ�ो यत्र यत्र अभूत् तत्र तत्र दुिभ�� मा�रका अनावृि� आिदकं न अभूत् ॥ ११५ ॥ *Akroora's* father, *Shvaphalka*, wherever he is present, in those areas, pandemics, rains not being there, famine, never happened.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 In the country of *Kaashee raaja*, there were no rains at all. He took *Shvaphalka* and immediately, rains came pouring down. \(Here, *Andhaka* is explaining the powers of *Shvaphalka* which he had seen\). Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 117: काशी राज प�ाः गभ� क�ार�ं पूव�मासीत् ॥ ११७ ॥ *Kaashee Raaja's* wife was pregnant with a daughter.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 119: एवं च त� गभ�� �ादश वषा�िण अिन�ामतो ययुः ॥ ११९ ॥ 12 years passed like this, and she never delivered. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 120: काशी राजः च ताम् आ�जां गभ�स्थाम् आह ॥ १२० ॥ *Kaashee Raaja* asked that girl child which was in the womb, as - Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 121: पुित्र क�ात् न जायसे िन��तामा�ं ते द्रष्टुम् इ�ािम एतां च मातरं िकम् इित िचरं �ेशियषिस इित उ�ा गभ�स्था एव �ाजहार ॥ १२१ ॥ Why are you not being born, please do come out. I want to see your face. Why are you giving so much trouble to your mother, not coming out of the womb for 12 years. When he asked thus, the girl child in the womb replied. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 122: तात यिद एकैकां गां िदने िदने ब्रा�णाय प्रय�ित तत् अहम् अ�ैः ित्रिभः वष�ः अ�ात् गभा�त् ततः अव�ं िन�िम�ािम इित एतत् वचनम् आक� राजा िदने िदने ब्रा�णाय गां प्रदात् ॥ १२२ ॥ If you give one cow in donation to one *Braahmana* every single day for three years, after three years, I will be born, come out of this womb. He started donating a cow to a *Braahmana* every single day. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 123: सा अिप तावता कालेन जाता ॥ १२३ ॥ 3 years passed like this, and then she was born.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 125: तां च गा��नी ं क�ां �प�ाय उपका�रणे गृहम् आगताया अ�भूतां प्रादात् ॥ १२५ ॥ When *Shvaphalka* had come to *Kaashee Raaja's* kingdom, in order to get rains there, just like offering *arghya* to an *atithi*, he offered *Gaandhinee* in marriage to *Shvaphalka*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 126: त�ाम् अयम् अक्रूरः �फ�ात् ज�े ॥ १२६ ॥ *Akroora* was born from *Shvaphalka* and *Gaandinee*. *Shvaphalka* and *Gaandinee* both had so much powers, and *Akroora* was born to them. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 127: त� एवं गुण िमथुनात् उ�ि�ः ॥ १२७ ॥ So, for people with so much powers, *Akroora* was born. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 128: तत् कथम् अ��न् अपक्रा�े अत्र दुिभ�� मा�रकािद उपद्रवा न भिव��� ॥ १२८ ॥ *Akroora*, who was born to so much illustrious parents with so much powers; if *Akroora* leaves the place, then definitely famine, disease, will happen here. This is the reason as explained by *Andhaka*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 129: तत् अयम् अत्र आनीयताम् अलम् अितगुणवित अपराध अ�ेषणेन इित, यदुवृ�� अ�क� एतत् वचनम् आक� केशव उग्रसेन बलभद्र पुरोगमैः यदुिभः कृतापराध ितित�ुिभः अभयं द�ा �फ� पुत्रः �पुरम् आनीतः ॥ १२९ ॥ So, please go and bring *Akroora*. He has very good qualities, and when a person has got such good qualities, one should not go and search for defects in such a person, though some defects might be there, because he has excellent qualities. *Sri Krishna, Balabhadra, Ugrasena*, all the prominent people of the *Yadu* clan, though *Akroora's* people had killed *Shatrughna*, and these people had tolerated all his mistakes, they gave him *abhaya*, said "Don't get scared, you will not be harmed", and they brought back *Shvaphalka's* son *Akroora* back to *Dwaarakaa*.

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: तत्र च इित | तत्र बभूवुः इित अ�यः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 131: कृ�ः िच�यामास ॥ १३१ ॥ *Krishna* started to think like this. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 132: ��म् एतत् कारणं यत् अयं गा���ां �फ�ेन अक्रूरो जिनतः ॥ १३२ ॥ *Akroora* was born of *Shvaphalka* and *Gaandhinee*, it is true that they have a lot of powers, but that seems to be a very small thing for the kind of powers that he is showing, when he comes back. All the calamities are disappearing, this cannot be due to the simple cause of being born from *Shvaphalka* and *Gaandinee*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 133: सुमाहान् च अयम् अनावृि� दुिभ�� मा�रकािद उपद्रव प्रितषेधकरी प्रभावः ॥ १३३ ॥ This power that he has displayed when he came back, seems to be very great.

The *Syamantaka Mani* is with him only, *Krishna* was very sure of this. He thought of some reason and invited all the *Yaadavaas*, to his house for a meeting. There is one *paathaantara - alpa upaadaanam*. Meaning that he has very little things with him, he cannot do so many *yaagaas* with what he possesses. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: अन� इित | उपादानं जीिवकाद्र�म् | अचीकरत् का�रतवान् | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 138: तत्र च उपिव�ेषु अ�खलेषु यदुषु पूव� प्रयोजनम् उप�� पय�विसते च त��न् प्रस�ा�र प�रहास कथाम् अक्रूरेण सह कृ�ा जनाद�नः तम् अक्रूरम् आह ॥ १३८ ॥ After explaining the purpose for which He had assembled all the *Yadus* in his house, incidentally He started chatting with *Akroora*, and told *Akroora* thus - Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 139: दानपते जानीम एव वयं यथा शतध�ना तत् इदम् अ�खल जगत् सार भूतं �म�कं र�ं भवतः समिप�तं तत् अशेष रा� उपकारकं भवत् सकाशे ित�ित; ित�तु; सव� एव वयं तत् प्रभाव फल भुजः ; िकं तु एष बलभद्रो अ�ान् न आशि�तवान् तत् अ�त् प्रीतये दश�य� इित अिभधाय जोषं �स्थते भगवित वासुदेवे स र�ः सः अिच�यत् ॥ १३९ ॥ O *Daanapati Akroora*, we all know very well that *Shatadhanva* has given the wonderful *Syamantaka Mani* to you in order to keep it safe. That which is helping the entire kingdom, is there with you, we know that. Let it be there with you. We are all enjoying the powers of that *Syamantaka **Mani*. Because of that, this kingdom is so prosperous. But, *Balabhadra* is  [[167]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 always doubting Me, he thinks that I am having the *Syamantaka Mani*. In order to dispel the doubts of *Balabhadra*, can you please show that *Syamantaka Mani* to everyone here. *Akroora* starts to think, because he has the *Mani*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 140: िकम् अत्र अनु�ेयं ? अ�था चेत् ब्रवीिम अहं तत् केवल अ�र ितरोधानम् अ����ो र�म् एते द्र��� अित िवरोधो न �म इित सि�� तम् अ�खल जगत् कारण भूतं नारायणम् आह अक्रूरः ॥ १४० ॥ What should I do now? If I say that I don't have the *Syamantaka Mani*, just by mere searching my clothes, they will find the *Syamantaka Mani*. Then they will start developing enmity towards me, which is not good because they are very powerful. Thinking like this, *Akroora* says. He tells *Sri **Krishna* who is none other than *Naaraayana* who is the sole cause of the world. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 13, Shloka 141: भगवन् मम एतत् �म�क र�ं शतधनुषा समिप�तम्, अपगते च त��न् अ� �ः पर�ः वा भगवान् याचिय�ित इित कृतमितः अित कृ��ेण एताव�ं कालम् अधारयम् ॥ १४१ ॥ O *Bhagavaan, Shatadhanu* gave me the *Syamantaka Mani*, and I have it. After Shatadhanu was killed, I was keeping it with me thinking that You will ask me today or tomorrow or day-after-tomorrow, or some other time. With great difficulty, I am protecting it, thinking that You will ask for it any day.

That is why I was keeping it. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[168]] of 249

He fell from the path of righteousness only for a brief time. Whatever is told in the mantra as यत् देवािपः शंतनवे पुरोिहतम् is applicable to another *kalpa. Devaapi* started to bring out arguments against what the *Brahmins* said. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 27: ततः ते ब्रा�णाः श�नुम् ऊचुः ॥ २७ ॥ Then the *Brahmins* told *Shantanu* thus.

Whatever wrong you had done is all corrected as *Devaapi* has fallen from the path of righteousness, and you will not have any problem. There will be rains in your kingdom. He has fallen from the path of righteousness, because he is talking against the *Vedaas*, which is established from time immemorial.

It was told how the dharma declines steadily in the Kali yuga, and at the end of *Kali yuga*, the *Kalki **avataara* will start. *Bhagavaan Vishnu* incarnates as *Kalki*, in the house of a *Brahmin* by name *Vishnuyashas*. He will destroy all evil forces, and establish all people in their *varna* and *aashrama dharmaas*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 99: अन�रं च अशेषः कलेः अवसाने िनशावसाने िवबु�ानाम् इव तेषाम् एव जनपदानाम् अमल �िटक दल शु�ा मतयो भिव��� ॥ ९९ ॥ When *Kalki avataara* happens, and he establishes all people in their *varna* and *aashrama dharmaas*, the *Kali yuga* ends completely, as though at the end of night, when people wake up in the morning, for the same people, their minds will become so pure and clear just like the *sphatika shilaa*, without any dirt or defects.

When they come together, in the *Pushya nakshatra*, when all are in the same *raashi*, that is when the *Kruta yuga* starts.

At the end of the *chaturyuga*, all the *grahaas* will be in the same position. When all the *grahaas* are in the same *nakshatra* and *raashi* only, the *yuga* starts. Or, it can also be interpreted as only these four *grahaas* are taken, and this is *graha baahulya* - these are the prominent planets which are to be in one position. This is explained in *Bruhat* *Jaataka* of *Varaahamihira, Chandra, Arka, Jeeva, Jnya, Sita, Kuja, Arki* - Moon, Sun *, Bruhaspati, Budha, Shukra, Angaaraka, Shani* are mentioned here - they have to be together. *Chandra, Arka, Jeeva* are said to be *Sattva samjnyaas*, indicating *Sattva. Jnya* and *Sita* indicate Rajas. Kuja and *Arki* are *Tamas*. Every 12 years, in *Karkataka maasa, Amaavaasyaa*, they all go in the same star, that is why the *raashi* is also mentioned, that they should be in the same *raashi*. This indicates the time when *Kruta* yuga starts. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 103: अतीता वत�मानाः च तथा एव अनागताः च ये |  [[236]] of 249

Vaayu Puraana also tells the same thing - 1500 years, from *Pareekshit* to the last Nanda king. Starting with *Nanda* himself, this *Kali kaala* starts, when the *Saptarshis* reach *Poorvaashaada nakshatra*, then adharma will increase.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 111: िवपरीतािन �ष्�ा च िनिम�ािन िह पा�वः | याते कृ�े चकार अथ सः अिभषेकं परीि�तः ॥ १११ ॥ When *Dharmaputra* saw that adharma was getting more and more prominent, at the time when *Krishna* left, he made *Pareekshit* the king, and he left. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 112: प्रया��� यदा च एते पूवा�षाढां महष�यः | तदा न�ात् प्रभृित एष गितवृ��ं गिम�ित ॥ ११२ ॥ When these *Saptarshis* come to the *Poorvaashaada* *nakshatra*, starting with King *Nanda*, this *Kali* will become prominent. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 113: य��न् कृ�ो िदवं यातः त��न् एव तदा अहिन | प्रितप�ं किलयुगं त� सां�ां िनबोध मे ॥ ११३ ॥ The day *Krishna* ended His incarnation and left this world, on the same day, *Kaliyuga* started and became prominent. I will tell you the time duration of that. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[239]] of 249

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: भगव� ानकाल�ेन कलेः प्र�ावात् त�ं�ा प्रथमांश उ�ा अिप इह अनू�ते त्रीिण ल�ािण इित | अत्र सं�ािदिवविज�ता किलसं�ा उ�ा परीि�त् काले किलसं�ािद�ात् | शतािन तािन इित अत्र तु िद� �ादश अ� शतम् इित सं�ािदसिहता सं�ा उ�ा | Earlier itself the *Kali yuga* duration was told. Why is it told again? Between *yugaas* there is a *Sandhyaa kaala*. This is told including that *Sandhyaa kaala*. During *Pareekshit kaala*, the *Kali Sandhyaa* period starts. At the end of a *chaturyuga*, there is a *Sandhyaa kaala*, where there is a gradual change from *Kaliyuga* to *Krutayuga*. These 1200 years includes the *Sandhyaa kaala*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 115: शतािन तािन िद�ानां स� प� च सं�या | िन�ेषेण गते त��न् भिव�ित पुनः कृतं ॥ ११५ ॥ According to the *divya varsha*, 1200 *devamaana*, when this is completed, then, again *Kruta yuga* will start. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 116: ब्रा�णाः �ित्रयाः वै�ाः शूद्राः च ि�जस�म | युगेयुगे महा�ानः समतीताः सहस्रशः ॥ ११६ ॥ In every *yuga*, the *Braahmanaas, Kshatriyaas, Vaishyaas* and *Shoodraas*, thousands of them have come and gone. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 117: ब��ा�ामधेयानां प�रसं�ा कुलेकुले | पौन��ािद सा�ा� न मया प�रकीित�ता ॥ ११७ ॥ *Paraasharar* told about so many *vamshaas* to *Maitreyar*. He is telling that so many have come and gone, and it is not possible to tell all their names. Many names are repeating and similar, and I did not tell you all the names.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: ब��ािद इित | प्रितकुलं ना�ाम् आन� पौन��ा�ां प�रसं�ा प�रतः सं�ा न उ�ा | In every *kula*, so many names are again repeating, it is impossible to tell all the names. So they are not told. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 118: देवािपः पौरवो राजा पु�ः च इ�ाकु वंशजः | महायोगबलोपेतौ कलापग्रामसंिश्रतौ ॥ ११८ ॥ *Devaapi, Puruvamsha*, \(or *Maru*\), *Ishvaaku*, and the descendants of all these *kulaas*, they were very powerful and strong kings. They were all living in *Kalaapagraama*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 119: कृते युगे तु इहाग� �त्र प्रावत�कौ िह तौ | भिव�तो मनोव�श बीजभूतौ �व�स्थतौ ॥ ११९ ॥ In *Kruta yuga*, they all come here and start the *Kshatriya vamsha* again. They are the origin for the *Manu vamsha* in future. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 120: एतेन क्रमयोगेन मनुपुत्रैः वसुंधरा | कृतत्रेता�ापरािण युगािन त्रीिण भु�ते ॥ १२० ॥ By these people, in order, the sons of *Manu* will enjoy this earth, in these three *yugaas - Kruta, Treta* and *Dvaapara*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: एतेन इित | कृत त्रेता �ापरािण इित युगत्रयं भु��वचनं कलेः अ��त्र�ात् | Why only three - *Kruta, Tretaa, Dvaapara* are told. Even in *Kaliyuga*, many *Kshatriya vamshaas* were told by *Paraasharar*. This is because it is a very short period compared to the other three *yugaas*. That is why it is not mentioned here separately. *Kshatriyaas* are very few in the *Kaliyuga*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 121: कलौ ते बीजभूताः तु केिचत् ित��� वै मुने | यथा एव देवािप पु� सांप्रतं समिध�श्थतौ ॥ १२१ ॥ In *Kaliyuga*, these are all the people who will continue this *vamsha*. Some of them will still be there to continue the *vamsha*, like *Devaapi, Puru*, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 122: एष तु उ�ेशतो वंशः तव उ�ो भूभुजां मया |  [[241]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 िन�खलो गिदतुं श�ो न एष वष�शतैः अिप ॥ १२२ ॥ These *vamshaas* I have just told you - some of these kings only. If I have to tell completely, even hundred years is not enough. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 123: एते च अ�े च भूपाला यैः अत्र ि�ितम�ले | कृतं मम�ं महो�ैः िन�ं हेय कलेवरे ॥ १२३ ॥ These kings, and also other kings, in this world, were all covered by *moha*, and then they thought they had this belongingness, idea of possession, that this is mine, in their bodies, in their land, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 124: कथं मया इयम् अचला म�ुत्र� कथं मही | मदंश� इित िच�ाता� ज�ुः अ�म् इमे नृपाः ॥ १२४ ॥ All these kings, how did they spend their time? How can own this land forever, how can my son get this land, my descendants, it should continue in my *vamsha* only, they should only be ruling over all these places, they worried about these things only, and lived their life and passed away. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 125: ते�ः पूव�तराः च अ�े ते�ः ते�ः तथा परे | भिव�ाः च एव या��� तेषाम् अ�े च ये अिप अनु ॥ १२५ ॥ Those who were before them, and those before them, and even in future those who will come, those who follow them again, all these people. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 126: िवलो� आ�जयो�ोगं यत्रा�ग्रान् नरािधपान् | पु�प्रहासैः शरिद हस�� इव वसुंधरा ॥ १२६ ॥ *Bhoomi devi* is laughing at them, looking at them, all their efforts and endeavours in order to win over the land, to win over the earth. The earth itself is laughing at them, like the flower blooms in Sharat kaala. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 127: मैत्रेय� पृिथवीगीता�लोकां�ात्र िनबोध मे | यानाह धम��िजने जनकायािसतो मुिनः ॥ १२७ ॥ *Pruthivi* has told these *shlokaas*. I will tell you, listen to them. Asitamuni has told this to *Dharmadhvaji*, who was a *Janaka*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 128: पृिथवी उवाच -  [[242]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 कथमेष नरे�ाणां मोहो बु��मताम् अिप | येन फेनसधमा�णो अिप अित िव�� चेतसः ॥ १२८ ॥ *Pruthivi* told - Though they are very intelligent, how can they have this kind of a delusion, *moha*, about owning this land. They are equivalent to a bubble in an ocean. They just come and go, are so short lived. They seem to be very confident about what they are thinking. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 129: पूव�म् आ�जयं कृ�ा जेतुम् इ��� म��णः | ततो भृ�ां च पौरां� िजगीष�े तथा �रपून् ॥ १२९ ॥ First, they want to win over themselves, then they want to win over their ministers and servants, and all the people and enemies. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 130: क्रमेण अनेन जे�ामो वयं पृ�ी ं ससागराम् | इित आस�िधयो मृ�ुं न प��� अिवदूरगम् ॥ १३० ॥ Slowly, let us win over the entire world, along with the oceans. Like this, they are all the time interested in winning over the land, and they don't see death which is not very far off. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 131: समुद्रावरणं याित भूम�लमथो वशम् | िकयत् आ�जय� एतत् मु��ः आ�जये फलम् ॥ १३१ ॥ They go till the end of the ocean, and they occupy the entire earth *bhoo **mandala*, and what is this compared to the *indriya jaya*, which will actually lead to *mukti*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: रा� मु�ोः इ��य जय सा��े िकं मु��ं िह�ा अ�ेन रा�ेन इित आह समुद्रेित | Winning over the kingdom, establishing themselves, and winning over their own senses - these two cannot be compared. Winning over the senses will lead them to liberation itself. Winning over the land is so meagre. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 132: उ�ृ� पूव�जा याता यां नदाय गतः िपता | तां ममतेवीव मूढ�ात् जेतुम् इ��� पािथ�वाः ॥ १३२ ॥ Their forefathers, the kings, when they passed away, they did not take the land. Their father did not take it along with him. *Pruthivi* is telling -  [[243]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 "They did not take me". They all passed away without taking me. Out of stupidity, they are trying to win over. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: उ�ृ� इित | यां भुवं उ�ृ� न आदाय एव, िपतामहा�ा याताः िपता च गतः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 133: म�ृते िपतृपुताणां भ्रातॄणां चािप िवग्रहः | जयते अ�� मोहेन मम�ात् ध्रुतचेतसाम् ॥ १३३ ॥ There will be difference of opinion, fights, among father and son, among brothers, in order to win over the land. Thinking that this is mine, the idea of possession is what is leading to all this. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 134: पृ�ी ममेयं सकला ममैषा मद�य� अिप च शा�तीयम् | यो यो मृतो िह अत्र बभूव राजा कुबु��रासीत् इित त� त� ॥ १३४ ॥ Regarding earth, one king says "This is mine". Another king says "This is mine". "This belongs to my descendants forever". Whoever has died and passed away, all those people had this evil thought. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पृ्वी इित | पृ�ी मम इयम् इित िभ�व�ृवा�भङ्�ः | तत्र भूः एषा मम् इित एकः | उयं मम इित अ�ः | अपरो मम इयं शा�ती इित वदन् एव यो यो राजा मृतो लोका�रे जातः , त� त� अिप इह प्रा�रणात् इयं भूः मम इित बु��ः आसीत् | मृते अ�त्रे पाठे , अ�त्र प्राचीन राि� मृते अथ अ�ो यो बभूव राजा त� अिप एवं दुबु���ः आसीत् | Before dying, they all thought that this belongs to me only. Every king thought like this. Every king had the same thought that this belongs to them. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 135: �ष्�ा मम�ात् धृतिच�मेकं िवहाय मां मृ�ुवशं व्रज�म् | त�ानु यः त� कथं मम�ं ��ा�दं म�भवं करोित ॥ १३५ ॥ One king thought that this land belonged to him only. When he passed away, having seen him also, even then, people are not realizing. When he died leaving me here, one who follows him, how can he again have the idea of possession in him, that this belongs to him, even having seen a king who passed away without taking anything. Thus says *Pruthivi*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[244]] of 249

He says to his enemies - "Leave this land and go - this belongs to me only, this is mine". At the same time, they are such stupid idiotic people, that I have pity for them. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पृिथवी इित | इित एवं मम� का�रषु मम अितहासो भवित, दया या�ुपैित मािमित शेषः | दयामुपैमीित वा पाठः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 137: श्री पराशरः - इित एते धरणी गीताः �ोक मैत्रेय यैः श्रुताः | मम�ं िवलयं याित तपित अक� यथा िहमम् ॥ १३७ ॥ *Sri Paraasharar* - What is the *phala* for those who listen to this, understand that they will not have any *mamakaara*. Whoever listens these *shlokaas* told by *Pruthivi*, for them, the *mamatva* will go away. Just as the ice melts away in the burning Sun. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 138: इित एष किथतः स�क् मनोः वंशो मया तव | यत्र �स्थितप्रवृ�� िव�ोः अंशांशका नृपाः ॥ १३८ ॥ Like this, I have told you the *Manu vamsha*. All these are *Vishnu's Amsha*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 139: �नोित य इमं भ�ा मनोः वंशम् अनुक्रमात् | त� पापम् अशेषं वै प्रण�ित अमला�नः ॥ १३९ ॥ Whoever listens to this with a lot of devotion, this *Manu vamsha*, all their sins will get destroyed. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 140: धन धा����म् अतुलां प्रा�ोित अ�ाहते��यः | श्रु�ा एवम् अ�खलं वंशं प्रश�ं शिशसूय�योः ॥ १४० ॥  [[245]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 This *vamsha charita* of *Shashi* and *Soorya* - the *Chandra vamsha* and *Soorya vamsha*, listening to all these with controlled senses, and with great devotion, they will get all the prosperity - *dhana, dhaanya*, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 141: इ�ाकु जह्नु मा�ातृ सगरािवि�तान् रघून् | ययाित न�षा�ां च �ा�ा िन�ाम् उपागतान् ॥ १४१ ॥ When they all passed away - *Ikshvaaku, Jahnu, Maandhaatru, Sagara, **Avikshita, Raghu, Yayaati, Nahusha* and others - knowing that they were all there, and they passed away ... Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: इ�ाकु इित | िन�ाम् नाशम् | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 142: महाबलान् महावीया�न् अन� धन स�यान् | कृतान् कालेन बिलना कथाशेषान् नरािधपान् ॥ १४२ ॥ ... they were all very powerful people, they were very valiant, very strong, they had collected endless money, all these kings, only their story is remaining now. As time passed away, they all passed away, and only their story remains. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 143: श्रु�ा न पुत्र दारादौ गृह�ेत्रािदके तथा | द्र�ादौ वा कृतप्र�ो मम�ं कु�ते नरः ॥ १४३ ॥ If one listens to this, then they will not have the idea of possession, idea of "mine" in son, wife, house, land, wealth - they will not have the idea of possession. They will get the idea of non possession in all of these. They will be detached. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 144: त�ं तपो यैः पु�षप्रवीरैः उ�ा�िभः वष�गणान् अनेकान् | इष्�ा सुय�ैः बिलनो अितवीया�ः कृता नु कालेन कथावशेषाः ॥ १४४ ॥ All these great people have performed tapas for many many years, raising both their hands for thousands of years. They performed lots of good *yajnyaas*, they became very powerful and strong, but as time passed by, they all passed away, and only their name is remaining here. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 145: पृथुः सम�ान् िवचचार लोकान् अ�ाहतो यो िविजता�रचक्रः | स कालवातािभहतः प्रण�ः ि��ं यथा शा�िलतूलम�ौ ॥ १४५ ॥  [[246]] of 249 





www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 *Pruthu* went around the entire world, and unstopped, won over all his enemies. He was hit by the wind of *kaala*, time, and he was also destroyed. As though the cotton is thrown into fire, and it burns. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 146: यः कात�वीय� बुभुजे सम�ान् दीपान् समाक्र� हता�रचक्रः | कथा प्रस�ेषु अिभधीयमानः स एव संक� िवक� हेतुः ॥ १४६ ॥ As *Kaartaveeryaarjuna* who was a great king, enjoyed all the continents, he occupied the whole earth and won over all his enemies; when someone is telling about his story, then they will get a doubt whether he was really there or not. Because he is no more now, and only his story is remaining. People get a doubt whether he was really there or not. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: य इित | संक� िवक� हेतुः संक�� मनसः िवक�ः संशयः , त� हेतुः िकम् एवम् िवधः काि�त् आसीत् न वा इित संशय� िनिम�म् | They get a doubt in their mind. Is it possible for someone to be like this. Was he really there or not? That is the state now. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 147: दशाननािव�त राघवाणाम् ऐ�य�मु�ािसत िदङ्मुखानाम् | भ�ािप िश�ं न कथं �णेन भ्रूभ�पातेन िधक् अ�क� ॥ १४७ ॥ Their wealth was all over, and they had won over all directions, *Dashaanana, Avikshata, Raaghava* and others. Even their ash is not remaining now. Yama, just by the raising of his eyebrows, they all got destroyed. Not even their ash is remaining now. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: दशानन इित | भ�ािप कथं न जातं कथं न ित�ित | यत् वा तेषाम् ऐ�य� िन�ेषद��ात् भ�ावस्थम् अिप न जातम् | इदम् कथम् इित आ�य� | How is it possible?

Only his story is remaining now. He is also gone. Having listened to this, how can, in their own self, think that this belongs to me. They are all dull minded ones. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[247]] of 249

Means that they have *deha aatma* *bhramaa*. They think that the body itself is *aatman*. Even in their body they cannot think that this is mine. How can they think in their land, house, family, son, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 149: भगीरथा�ाः सगरः ककु�थो दशाननो राघवल�णौ च | युिधि�रा�ाः च बभूवुः एते स�ं न िम�ा � नु ते न िव�ः ॥ १४९ ॥ *Bhageeratha* and others, *Sagara, Kakutstha, Dashaanana, Raaghava, **Lakshmana, Yudhishthira* - is it true or false, we do not know whether they were there.

When he cannot make in his own body, how can he think of *mamatva* in his own wife or land, or even in other people who are having embodied souls. How can he say that they are his friends or his relatives? How can one have the idea of possession, how can one have such a thought?
