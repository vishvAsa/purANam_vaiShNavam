Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 2, where *Maitreyar * asks *Paraasharar * to tell him about all the past *Manvantaraas*, and also the future *Manvantaraas*. In the future *Manvantaraas*, details of who is the *Manu*, who are the *Saptarshis*, who is the Indra, who are the *devataas - Paraasharar * tells him. He now starts to tell about how *Vedaas * were divided, and how the *pravartana * of *Vedaas * is being done, in every *Chaturyuga*. 



He told about the past seven *Manvantaraas*. After telling about the seven *Manvantaraas*, which are going to come in the future, when the 14 *Manvantaraas * get concluded, that will be 1000 *Chaturyugaas*, a *kalpa*, one day of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. Each *Manvantara * is roughly about 71 *Chaturyugaas*. After having told about the 14 *manvantaraas*, he again tells about the *Vedaas. Sri **Paraasharar * is going to tell this.

At the end of every *Chaturyuga*, there is no *pralaya*; but at the end of every *kalpa*, there is *pralaya*. At the end of every *Chaturyuga*, there is a *sandhi amsha*, and again the next *Chaturyuga * starts. At the end of the *yuga, Vedaas * will become *ksheena*.

There is nobody who is superior to Him. I have understood all these things. 



He is creator. He does *upasamhaara*, goes and merges into Him. He is *antaryaami * and is responsible for the sustenance. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Jnyaatam iti | Jagat vishnuh iti tat aatmakatvam uktam, vishnou iti laya-****sthityoh sthaanatvam, vishnutah iti kaaranatvam | **Everything is *Vishnvaatmaka, Bhagavadaatmaka*.

Everything is established in Him means that He is responsible for the sustenance, and also *laya*, dissolution; He is the place where everything goes and merges. He is the creator, of this world. 



*Paraasharar * has given an introduction in the previous *adhyaaya*, about how *Vedavyaasa * has divided the *Vedaas * into four. Now, *Maitreyar * gets interested in that particular aspect, to know more about it.

the various *shaakhaas * how they were divided.

Every *Dvaapara yuga, Vishnu * takes on the form of *Vyaasa*. Veda, which is present as one single unit \(during *Krutayuga * and *Tretayuga*\), he divides into four *Vedaas*, and multiple branches.

Looking at the capability, the *tejas*, the *bala *- all these are very diminished and very less in *manushyaas*. Looking at that, for their good, for the good of all beings, he divides the *Vedaas * like this.

Paraasharar * extols the importance and greatness of *Pranava*, which is said to be the beginning of the *Vedaas*, the *prakruti*, that will be told now. " *Yat vedaadou svarah proktah vedaante cha **prakeertitah, tasya prakruti leenasya yah parah sa maheshvarah*", the greatness of that *pranava * is being extolled here. Though the *Vedaas*, which were present as one unit, were divided into four, the *pranava * is *avibhakta*, not divided. *Pranava * is present only as one *akshara*, and is unchanged. It is called *pranava*, is said to be one *akshara*, and is also said to be Brahma. Why is *Pranava * told as *Brahma*, is www.sadagopan.org  [[28]] of 219 



Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



because it itself is very vast, and also makes something else as vast. By doing the *ucchaarane * of *Pranava * itself, it makes one great, and also it expands, and makes one big. 





**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 3, Shloka 23: ****Pranava avasthitam nityam bhooh bhuvah svah iti eeryate | ****Rug yajuh saama athaarvano yat tasmai brahmane namah || **It is said that the three *vyaahrutis, Bhooh, Baahyahuvah, Suvah*, are created, and are eternally established in *Pranava*. The *Rigveda, Yajurveda, Saamaveda, **Atharvaveda*, are all established in this only. I pay obeisance to that *pranavaatmaka shabdabrahma*. 



*Bhooh, Bhuvah, Suvah * are said to be *vyaahrutis*. Just by pronouncing them, the three worlds were created by *Brahma*, it is said. All these three - *Bhooh, Bhuvah, **Suvah * are established in *Pranava*.   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Bruhatva brahmanatve upapaadayati pranava avasthitam iti | Vyaahruti trayam ****ruk aadi chatushtayam cha pranava avasthitam eeryata iti yaavat, tasmaat ****shabda aatmane tasmai brahmane nama iti anvayah | Pranavasya kaarana ****avasthaayaam antargata vyaahruti aadikatvena bruhatvam | Kaarya ****avasthaayaam vyaahruti veda roopena parinaamaat brahmanatvam iti bhaavah ****|**   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 3, Shloka 24: ****Jagatah pralaya utpattyoh yat tat kaarana samjnytam | ****Mahatah paramam guhyam tasmai subrahmane namah ||** From the *akaara, Rigveda * is created; from *ukaara, Yajurveda * is created; from *makaara, Saamaveda * is created. This is why everything is established in *Pranava. Akaara * is said to be *prakruti * of that, and that which is denoted by that *akaara * is *Paramaatman. Akaara * is *vaachaka, vaachya * is *Paramaatman*. The *pralaya, utpatti * of this world, that which is said to be cause of this creation, and dissolution of all these worlds, we pay obeisance to that *Pranava*. Because of the sacred position given to *Pranava*, it is the cause of all the worlds. *Shabda brahma * is thought of as *Pradhaana * itself, *jagat kaarana*. One has to meditate on this as the cause of *jagat*, and also *laya sthaana, pradhaana * which is beyond *mahat*, more subtle than *mahat*, is this *pranava*. One should meditate thus. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Atha pranavam kaaranatayaa pradhaana taadaatmyena stuvan pranamati - ****jagatah ityaadinaa bahudhaatmakam iti antena jagata iti | Pralaya uptpattyoh ****iti | Pradhaanaat hi jagat utpattih, tasmin layah, tasmaat tayoh tat kaaranam | **Because *Pranava * is said to be the *kaarana*, from *Pranama * only, everything is emanating, is told. *Pranava * is the *prakruti * for all the *Vedaas*.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



being one with *Pradhaana * itself, the *Moola prakruti*. All these worlds are *praakruta * only, created from *prakruti, sattva, rajas, tamas*. From the *vikaara * of *prakruti * only, all these worlds are created. The three *lokaas, **Bhooh, Bhuvah, Suvah * are created by the *vyaahrutis*, which are all embedded in the *Pranava. Pranava * is said to be equal to, same as *Pradhaana*; and that is how it is praised. *Pranava * is said to be the cause. *Jagat * is created from *Pradhaana*, is *vikaara * of that. *Moola prakruti * becomes *mahat*, then *ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, **panchabhootaas*, etc. During *pralaya*, this happens in the reverse order. Each *kaarya * goes and merges in the *kaarana*. All the *pancha bhootaas * merge into *tanmaatraas, tanmaatraas * merge into *ahamkaara*, that merges into *mahat*, then *mahat * merges into *pradhaana*. This is also told in the *Upanishads*. Because the worlds are created from *vyaahrutis, pranava * is told in *taadaatmya * with *pradhaana * only. So, it is told to be cause of all the worlds explained here.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 3, Shloka 25: ****Agaadha apaaram akshayyam jagat sammohanaalayam | ****Svaprakaasha pravruttibhyaam purushaartha prayojanam ||** These are all the praises for *Pranava * itself. It is very vast, endless. Characteristics of *pradhaana * are superimposed on *pranava * here. It has *sattva, **rajas * and *tamogunaas. Tamas * creates *moha. Sattva * creates *jnyaana. Rajas * is responsible for *pravruttis*, activities, *kaaryaas. Karma * is the effect of *rajas. **Jnyaana * is the effect of *sattva. Moha * is due to *tamas*. Various *purushaarthaas * can be attained by these. It is very vast, does not undergo any change, *avikaari*; it leads to *purushaartha*. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Agaadha apaaram iti | Jagat sammohanaalayam paapinaam sammohana ****tamoguna aalayam | Sva prakaasha pravruttibhyaam sattva-rajah ****kaaryaabhyaam jnyaana karmaabhyaam purushaarthasya saadhanam | **



Everything is from *Pranava*. It is the cause of the whole world. Some more *shlokaas * are going to explain the greatness of *Pranava*, making it identical with *pradhaana*, and giving it the characteristics of *pradhaana*. We will see them next. *Pradhaana * has three *gunaas - sattva, rajas, tamas*. The quality of *tamas * causes *moha*, illusion, and wrong knowledge. *Rajas * leads to action; one can do the *vaisika karmaas * and attain the *chatur-vidha purushaarthaas. Sattva **guna * leads to *jnyaana * and one can even attain *moksha*, by increasing the *sattva **guna*. The effects of *sattva * and *rajas * are *jnyaana * and *karma*. It leads to all the *purushaarthaas * and is a means for that. By doing *pranavopaasane*, all this can be done.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 3, where *Paraasharar * is telling about the 28 *Vedavyaasaas*, who came and divided the *Vedaas*, every time during the end of the *Dvaapara yuga*. And *Bhagavaan * Himself takes the form of *Veda Vyaasa * and does the *Veda vibhajane*, so that people can actually do *adhyayana*, as their power and *jnyaana * had reduced. After that, *Paraasharar * is praising the greatness of *Pranava*, and this is what we are studying. 



*Pranava * is said to be the *prakruti * of all the *Vedaas*. Which is said to encapsulate all the four *Vedaas*, and everything. 



This is praised in the *Upanishads, Taittiriya Upanishad, Om iti brahma, Om **iti idagam sarvam*, and whatever *mantraas * are started, are started with *Pranava*. All the *ritwiks*, whatever *mantraas * they say, they always start with *Pranava * only. The greatness of *Pranava * is told. It is said to be *Paramaatma vaachaka. **Patanjali * says in the *Yoga Shaastras - "Tasya vaachakah **pranavah". Pranavopaasane * is told in the *Upanishads*. 



*Pranava * is praised here, and equated with *pradhaana * itself. It houses all the worlds and encapsulates everything. Just like *pradhaana * which gets modified by the *sankalpa * of *Paramaatman*, being the *antaryaami*. *Pranava * is said to be like that. It is praised as though it is the cause of all the worlds. 





**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 3, Shloka 26: ****Saamkhyaajnyaanavataam nishthaa gatih shama dama aatmanaam | ****Yat tat avyaktam amrutam pravruttih brahma shaashvatam || ***Saamkhya jnyaana * is the knowledge of *prakruti*. In *Saankhya darshana*, it is said that *prakruti * and *purusha viveka * are important. For those who want to attain the *saankhya jnyaana*, this is the *pratishthaa*. Doing *upaasanaa * of *pranava * only, *yogis * who meditate upon the *pranava*, they can attain *shama, dama*, and all the *gunaas * through this. In the *Upanishads*, it is extolled as *avyakta, akshara * and all these *shabdaas*. It is eternal. 



*Avyakta * is unmanifest, very subtle, one cannot see it.

In the *Upanishads*, it is told as *avyakta, akshara * and these *shabdaas*. It is extolled in the *Upanishads*. It is partless, and pure. It shows itself as several effects of *prakruti*. www.sadagopan.org  [[31]] of 219

It is told as the cause of *Paramaatman. **Pranava * is the *vaachaka * and *vaachya * is *Paramaatman*. Doing meditation on *pranava*, one can attain *Paramaatman*. If we have to know the *vaachya*, it is through *pranava*. This way, it is the cause of *Paramaatman * Himself. It is extolled in the *Upanishads * in many ways, as *avyakta, akshara*. That *shabda brahma * which is the *pradhaana aatmaa*, which is the cause, equal to *pradhaana*. In the state of effect, *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, panchabhootaas*, it exists in many forms, and is *bahudaatmaka*. In the *poojyaa artha*, it is told as *subrahmane **namah*, the *'su' shabda * is used for *poojitatva*.

**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Atha pranavam bhagavat roopatvena stuvan pranamati - parama brahmana iti | ****Parama brahmatvam cha vaasudeva roopatvaat | ***Pranava * represents the *Paramaatman * Himself. It is also *vaachaka * for *Paramaatman*.

It remains as one *avayavi * also, as a whole. *Pranava * itself is one, and can also be divided into *akaara, ukaara, **makaara. Pranava * only is Lord *Vaasudeva*; one *Vaasudeva * who is the Lord is present in all beings. He is the one *antaryaami * in all the beings. There is no *bheda * in the *visheshya*. The *visheshanaas * are many - *chetanaas * and *achetanaas*. We see as so many forms - *deva, manushya, pakshi, sareesrupa*; in that way, He is many also. The *prakaaraas * are many, but the *prakaari * is One only. *Pranava * is said to be the *svaroopa * of *Paramaatman*.

He is present as the inner self of all the beings. He is one only. Because He is the Master, the Lord, He is untainted by the defects of any of these, though He is present as the Inner Self. He is said to be many because of the various forms that we see. All of them are presided over by Him as the Inner Self. This way, He is said to be many. *Sarvam khalvidam brahma*.

What is concluded in this *shloka * is that *Bhagavaan's sarvaatmakatva * is concluded. *Vedaas * which were undivided, and present as one unit; He is present in several forms, *Rig, Yajus, Saama, Atharva Veda*. He only is present as *Veda **Vyaasa*, and all the others who form these *shaakhaas*, He is only present in all those forms. He is only the *antaraatma * of everything; the *sarvaatmakatva * of *Bhagavaan * is told. In each *Veda*, He makes it into endless, innumerable number of *shaakhaas*, branches and sub branches. He is only all the branches, *shaakhaas*. 



This concludes this chapter, establishing the *sarvaatmakatva * of *Bhagavaan*, that He is only everything - the *Vedaas*, the branches, the *Vyaasaas * who created these branches, all are He only. He is *aatma * for everything. This is the *sarvaatmakatva * told.

The word *api * means that initially *Vedaas * were only three. It is told as *Vedaah **trayee, Rig, Yajus * and *Saama Veda*. And *Atharva Veda * was added later. *Brahma * is one who knew all the three. Or, *Brahma * is the one who also knew the *Atharva **Veda*.

|| Atha Panchamo Adhyaayah || ****Yaajnyavalkya’s Story, Shukla Yajurveda** * ** *Now, Chapter 5. 



*Paraasharar * is going to tell the story of how the *saakshaatkaara * of *Shukla **Yajurveda * was done by *Yaajnyavalkya*, and also *Vaishmpaayana's * story. How the *Shukla Yajurveda * was taught by *Surya * to *Yaajnyavalkya*, which we will see next. We are studying about how the *Vedaas * which were existing as one huge unit, were divided into four by *Vedavyaasa*. He accepted four *shishyaas, Paila * for *Rigveda, **Vaishampaayana * for *Yajurveda, Jaimini * for *Saamaveda, Sumantu * for *Atharvaveda*. How the four *Vedaas * were formed was also told. Though it is told as *Veda trayee*, the three *Vedaas*, one explanation given is that three kinds of *mantraas, **Adhvaryava, Houtra*, and *Oudgaatru mantraas*, were all taken from one big unit of *Vedaas * separately. Those which are used by the *Adhvaryu*, for performing the *yaagaas*, those which are used by the *Hotru*, and those which are used by the *Udgaatru*, were all taken out from one single *Veda*, which existed as one unit, and were named as *Yajurveda, Rigveda * and *Saamaveda*. Later on, the fourth *Veda * was also formed, picking up the other *mantraas*, which are used for the various *karmaas * of kings, like *Shaantika, Poushtika, Aabhichaarika*. Though four *ritviks * are there in all *yaagaas, Adhvaryu, Hotru, Udgaatru*, and *Brahma*, three kinds of *mantraas * are prominently used by the three *ritviks *- these are the *Adhvaryu mantraas, Hotru mantraas * and *Udgaatru mantraas*. This is one explanation given for the *trayee. Brahma * is the one who has studied the *Atharva **Veda*, and he also knows the other three *prayogaas*, he is supposed to be one of the *ritviks * for all the *yaagaas*. How the *prachaara * and *pravartana * of *Rigveda * was done, starting with *Paila * and all the *shishyaas, Indrapramiti, Baashkala * and all others, and it grew into innumerable number of branches, through *shishyaas, prashishyaas*, their sons, and it started getting multiple branches. It grew into a huge tree. This was all seen in *Amsha * 3, Chapter 4. In the current Chapter 5, *Paraasharar * continues to talk about how *Yajurveda **prachaara * was done. And then the *Saamaveda * and then *Atharva Veda*. While telling the *Yajurveda shaakhaa*, there is a small story which comes, about *Yaajnyavalkya * and *Vaishampaayana * which *Sri Paraasharar * tells.

27 *shaakhaas*, branches of *Yajurveda*, were done by *Vaishampaayana * who was *shishya * of *Vyaasa*. There are 27 main branches in *Yajurveda*. The tree of *Yajurveda * was divided into main branches. *Vyaasa's shishya, Vaishampaayana*, who was taken as *shishya * for promulgation of *Yajurveda*, created 27 main *shaakhaas*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Yajurveda taroh iti | Saptavimshati yajushah pradhaana shaakhaah | ****Brahmaanda uktah shadasheeti pakshah tat pratishaakhaa vivakshayaa | Taah ****cha kaanvaadi shukla yajuh panchadashakam cha samhatya eka shatam ****adhvaryu shaakhaah aapastambha uktaah syuh |** 27 *shaakhaas * told here are the main *shaakhaas * of *Yajurveda. Brahmaanda **Puraana * tells about 86 *shaakhaas*. Among the 27 main *shaakhaas*, these are the sub-branches. *Shukla Yajurveda * which is going to be told now, how *Yaajnyavalkya * obtained the *Shukla Yajurveda*, that is about *Kaanva * and other *shaakhaas*, and this is 15 *shaakhaas*. 86 and 15 put together, 101 is said to be the *Yajurveda shaakhaas*. This is how *Aapastambha Rishi * says. In the *Brahmaanda Puraana*, it is told that 86 branches are there. That means that these main branches have sub branches. *Shukla Yujurveda*, has *Kaanva * and other branches, totally 15 branches. This becomes 86 \+ 15 = 101, which is said to be the count of *Yajurveda shaakhaas*. It has the *mantraas * used by the *adhvaryu * in any *karma*. Out of these, 27 are the main branches created by *Vaishampaayana. Aapastambha rishi * has told that there are 101 branches in the *Yajurveda*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 5, Shloka 2: ****Shishyebhyah pradadou taah cha jagruhuh te api anukramaat |** He taught it to various students.

Kaashyapa * and others created three *samhitaas, *. The fourth one *Vyaasa * condensed it based on the three samhitaas created by kaashapa and other, into another one called *Romaharshanikaa*. It is so called becaus it was studied by Romaharshana and taught to his shishyas. Romaharshana and Ugrashravas, by both of them it was told to Shaunaka and others. As told in Maatsya purana – ‘Consisting of four lakh slokas this was taught by Vyaasa who has achieved wonders. It was taught to my father and my father taught it to me and I am telling you’. Thus The Puranas are divided into four in Kali Yuga and all of them have the rools in them. They are having different paathaas just like veda shaakhaas as told in Vayu Purana. In Kaurma Purana, this division of kaurma purana itself is told by itself thus – ‘this is the sacred Kaurma Purana which is the 15th one. Divided into four based on the division of samhitas’.

One who studies the *Vedaas * without the support of *Upabrahmanaas, Vedaas * are scared of them because it is said that *Vedaas * say that this person is going to cheat me; he has not understood the meanings of the *Vedaas*, has studied without the support of *Upabrahmanaas. Upabrahmanaas * have to be used in order to understand the meanings of the *Vedaas*. In these, *Itihaasaas * and *Puraanaas * are told. *Itihaasaas * are combined inside the *Puraanaas*, as in the 14 *Vidyaasthaanaas, Itihaasaas * are not mentioned.

*Puraanaas * are *upabrahmana * to *Vedaas*, and are responsible for establishing *dharmaas*. One can know the *dharmaas*, understand the *dharmaas * by studying the *Puraanaas*. These 14 are called *Dharma Vidyaa sthaanaas*. These are all accessories to studying *Vedaas*.

the *Upapuraanaas * only. 



*Meemaamsaa * is one *shaastra*. This is where *Bhaashyakaarar * establishes the *aikashaastrya * of *Meemaamsaa. Meemaamsa * is a *vyaakhyaana * on the *Vedaas. **Vedaas * have got two parts -*Poorvakaanda/Karmakaanda * and *Uttarakaanda/Jnyanaakaanda. Jaimini rishi * has written the meanings of the *Poorvakaanda * in the form of *Sootraas; Jaimini * is also a student of *Baadaraayanar. Baadaraayanar * teaches *Jaimini * the *Saamaveda * and he continues to teach to his students. The meanings of the *Uttarakaanda * are explained in the form of *Sootraas * by *Krishnadvaipaayanar / Vyaasar / **Baadaraayanar*, who is also the creator of these 18 *Puraanaas*. This is told as *aikashaastrya*, one *shaastra * only, that there are 2 chapters of the same book. This is told as one word *Meemaamsa*, and not as two words, as they are same *shaastra*. 



*Nyaayavistara * is by *Goutama Rishi*. 



The *Dharmashaastraas * establish the meaning of the *Karmakaanda. **Puraanaas * establish the meanings of the *Uttarakaanda. Itihaasa * is also embedded in *Puraana * itself.

Gaandharva * is about *geetha shaastra. **Arthashaastra * is about *dandaneeti, Dhanurveda * is about *astraas*. These are said to be *Upavedaas. Vyjayanti grantha * is telling about this.

**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Iti iti | Bheda hetuh manushyaanaam balaadi alpatvam | **What is the reason why these branches were created?

If they are *nitya*, how can there be *paathaantaraas, **shaakhaantaraas*, etc. In one it says *Vijnyaane tishthan*, in another it says *Aatmani **tishthan*.

they are eternal. But there are so many branches with so many variations in the *paathaas*. They look like *anitya*, but in totality there are one only. There may be a difference in which portion of which *shaakhaa * is being studied, because people may be studying different *shaakhaas*. In each *manvantara*, different *shrutis * are being studied. Based on that, in various parts itself, different *shrutis * are being practiced, this does not make *Vedaas * as *anitya*, because in totality, it is eternal. Different parts are being studied at different times. They are eternal, and various branches, *paathaantaraas * are seen.

Sri Engal Aalwaan * says that he is commenting on 6000 *shlokaas * of *Vishnu Puraana*. The 14 *dharmavidyaa **sthaanaas * were told, which are very important for us to study. Also www.sadagopan.org  [[69]] of 219 



Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



the *upavedaas * were told. It was declared that the *Vedaas * are eternal, *nitya*. For creation, sustenance, dissolution, the one responsible God is Lord *Mahaavishnu * only; this is what is declared in all the 18 *Puraanaas*. Though there are different *shaakhaas * of the *Vedaas*, being studied in different *manvantaraas * and different *yugaas*, the eternality of *Veda * does not get affected. As a unit, *Vedaas * are one. Now, *Paraasharar * is going to tell about the means by which one can get liberation, to not come under the sway of *Yama*. We are in *Amsha * 3, Chapter 7, where *Maitreyar * told *Sri Paraasharar * that "You have told me everything that I have asked for, the 14 worlds in the *Brahmaanda*, the *sapta dveepaas*, and whatever is there inside this *Brahmaanda*, and all the kinds of beings who are here, starting with the most subtle to the most gross. I also understand that there are innumerable beings, in this *Brahmaanda*, who are all caught here in this *samsaara*, due to their past *karma*; and there is not even one-eighth of an inch, where we cannot find one living being. All these beings after dying, go to hell and then to heaven, and keep moving here, getting born again and again. Are there any beings who are not under the sway of *Yama*, who get rid of this *samsaara*, and get liberated; I would like to know about them." What *Maitreyar * really wants to know is the means to *Moksha*, the *Moksha dharma*, which is explained in the commentary. 



Now, *Paraasharar * starts to tell about the dialogue between *Yama * and his assistant, *bhata*. Finally he wants to tell about the dharma, the means which is told in *Shruti, Smruti, Itihaasa, Puraana*, which when performed with an idea of worship of *Bhagavaan*, will lead one to *Moksha*. So that one can escape from this *samsaara*, the cycle of birth and death, and get liberated. In order to tell about this, he starts with the *Yama bhata samvaada. Paraasharar * says what he heard from what *Bheeshmar * had told *Nakula*.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 7: ****So aham icchaami tat shrotum yamasya vashavartinah | ****Na bhavanti naraa yena tat karma kathayasva me ||** Those who do not come under the sway of *Yama * but they escape from *samsaara*, what is that they should do, I want to know.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 8: ****Sri Paraasharah - ****Ayam eva mune prashno nakulena mahaatmanaa | ****Prushtah pitaamahah praaha bheeshmo yat tat shrunushva me ||** *Sri Paraasharar *- O *Maitreyar*, the same question was asked by *Nakula * to *Bheeshma; Bheeshmapitaamaha * answered him, and I will tell you what he told *Nakula*. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Ayam iti | Ayam eva prashno nakulena bheeshmam prati prushtah; atah sah **www.sadagopan.org  [[70]] of 219 



Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



**nakulaaya aaha iti anvayah | ***Nakula * had asked the very same question to *Bheeshma*; what *Bheeshma * told *Nakula*, I will tell you.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 9: ****Bheeshmah - ****Puraa mamaagato vatsa sakhaa kaalingako dvijah | ****Sa maam uvaacha prushto vai mayaa jaatismaro munih ||** *Bheeshma *- One *Brahmin * known to me came from *Kaalinga desha*, and that *muni* told me when I asked him this question. The *muni * by name *Jaatismara*, told *Kaalingaka * and *Kaalingaka * is telling *Bheeshma * that "I will tell you what that *muni * told me". 



The second *anvaya * is told by *Sri Engal Aalwaan * at the very end of this chapter. That interpretation is like this. There is a sage by name *Jaatismara*. The *Brahmin * from *Kaalinga desha * met me. When *Bheeshma * asked that *Kaalingaka **dvija*, he told *Bheeshma *- " *Mayaa jaatismaro munih*" is *Kaalingaka's * words. The *Kaalingaka Brahmin * says that "I had asked another *muni*, by name *Jaatismara * who told me this". This is the second *anvaya*. What *Bheeshma * is telling is " *Puraa mamaagato vatsa sakhaa kaalingako dvijah. Sa maam uvaacha". **"Prushto vai mayaa jaatismaro munih*" is what *Kaalingaka * is telling *Bheeshma*. The next few *shlokaas*, we have to understand that this is what the *muni * told *Kaalingaka*. 



So, there are two *anvayaas *- one, that a *muni * told *Kaalingaka*, and *Kaalingaka * told *Bheeshma*, and *Bheeshma * told *Nakula*. Another is that *Kaalingaka * himself is the *muni*, who told *Bheeshma*, and *Bheeshma * is telling *Nakula*. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Sa kaalingako munih tvayaa prushtam imam artham mayaa prushto maam prati ****uvaacha iti aaha puraa iti | **There are two interpretations which come for this *shloka * and the *shloka * coming after this.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



**tathaa abhoot | ***Bheeshmar * is telling *Nakula *- Why did I ask this question to *Kaalingaka dvija*, because whatever I heard from him happened exactly like what he said, and I have realized that he says the truth. Whatever that *Kaalingaka * said, what he had heard from the *muni*, that this will happen like this, that this person will be in some other place at this time, this will happen like this in future, whatever is far away, and whatever is going to happen after a time gap, all that whatever he said, everything happened exactly like what he said.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 11: ****Sa prushtah cha mayaa bhooyah shraddhadhaanena vai dvijah | ****Yat yat aaha na tat drushtam anyathaa hi mayaa kvachit ||** That *muni*, whatever he told me, exactly the same thing happened. And I also asked him this question. After having got faith in what he says, I asked him some more things, and whatever he said, everything happened exactly like that.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 12: ****Ekadaa tu mayaa prushtam etat yat bhavatoditam | ****Praaha kaalingako viprah smrutvaa tasya muneh vachah ||** *Bheeshmar * to *Nakula *- Whatever you have asked, I had asked that *Kaalingaka **dvija*, and he remembered what that *muni * had told him, and he told me. 



That whatever he said, the *muni*, is the truth, and that he is a *trikaalajnyaani*.   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Evam tasya pratyayitatvena tvayaa prushtam etat artha roopam mayaa prushtah ****pratyuvaacha iti aaha ekadaa iti | Kim pratyuvaacha iti apekshaayaam aaha ****smrutvaa iti |** After having made sure that whatever he told was true, whatever happened, whatever is going to happen, that is all true, I asked him the same question which you asked me, and he told me. This is what *Bheeshmar * is telling *Nakula*. He remembered what the *muni * had told, and *Kaalingaka dvija * told *Bheeshma*. 





**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 13: ****Jaatismarena kathito rahasyah paramo mama | ****Yamakinkarayoh yo abhoot samvaadah tam braveemi te || **His name is *Jaatismara*, and he tells a secret teaching, which is not to be told to everyone. This happened in great secrecy between *Yama * and his *kinkara*. That dialogue I am going to tell you.

what *Paraasharar * is telling *Maitreyar*. 





This is an often quoted *pramaana * in all our *granthaas*. What happened between *Yama * and his *Bhata * is told here. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 14: ****Svapurusham abhveekshya paashastam vadati yamah kila tasya karnamoole | ****Parihara madhusoodana prapannaan prabhuh aham anya nrunaam na ****vaishnavaanaam ||** *Yama * sees his *bhata * who is having *paasha * in his hand, and will catch all the beings, who are supposed to come to *Yamaloka * after death. Seeing him, eye to eye, *Yama * tells in hushed voice in his ears so that nobody should hear. Those who have taken refuge in *Madhusoodana*, just leave them out. I am only lord of other beings. Those who have surrendered unto *Madhusoodana*, they are all *Vaishnavaas*, I am not the Lord for them. I have no control on them, just leave them out.   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Sva purusham iti | Sva purusham ityaadi kaalinga vachanam |** *Kaalinga * is telling *Bheeshma. Bheeshmar * is telling *Nakula*. This is *Svapurusha *... 



**Parihara ityaadi yama vachanam |** *Parihara *... is what *Yama * told.

This is something which none of the masters or rulers would like to tell; they will not publicize their weaknesses publicly. Where they have no power, control, it is not to be told; this is the *raaja neeti*. Even if that *Vishnu naama * is pronounced loudly, those who are in hell, in *naraka*, also, by just listening to it, will escape from the *naraka*, and *Yama * will have nobody to rule over there; then he will lose his control over all of them; therefore he got scared, and that is why he is telling in hushed voice in the ear, the teachings which are told are "Don't have relations with the wives of kings", and things like that, are told in secrecy, the *raaja neeti*, which can lead to great difficulty. 



**Yamasya vaishnaveshu aprabhutve pramaanam \* Dravanti daityaah pranamanti ****devaah \* Prabhavo bhagavadbhaktaa maadrushaanaam ityaadi |** *Yama * does not have control on the *Vaishnavaas*, the *pramaanaas * are given for this - "Whenever someone sees a *Vaishnava*, all the *daityaas * will get liquefied, they will lose their powers; and *devaas * will do obeisance, do *namaskaara*", where *bhagavadbhaktaas * are lodged. *Yama * does not have any control over the *bhagavadbhaktaas*. 



*Yama * is looking at his *bhata * directly in the eye, in hushed voice, that only he www.sadagopan.org  [[73]] of 219

should listen - "Don't ever go near *Madhusoodana prapannaas*, those who have surrendered to *Madhusoodana*, and the *Vaishnavaas*", and that he has no control over them.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 15: ****Aham amara \(ganaa\) varaarchitena dhaatraa yama iti lokahitaahite niyuktah | ****Hariguvashago asmi na svatantrah prabhavati samyamane mama api vishnuh ||** All the *devaas * worship the *Bhagavaan*. I have been told to look after both the good and the bad of the *devaas*. I am under the control of my Lord, *Hari; **Vishnu * controls me also. 



*Samyamana = samyak niyamana. Yama * is telling that *Vishnu * controls him also. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Atra hetum aaha - ahamiti | Dhaatraa eeshvarena, hita ahite hita pravartane ****ahita nivartane cha |** I have been brought to this place, given these powers and employed here, in order to make sure that all the worlds are doing the good, and to avoid *ahita* for the *lokaas*. This is my role, and *Bhagavaan * Himself has given me this position, *Hari * is my Lord, and I am under His control, I am not independent.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 16: ****Katakamakutakarnikaadi bhedaih kanakam abhedam api eeshyate yathaikam | ****Sura pashu manujaadi kalpanaabhih harih akhilaabhih udeeryate tathaa ekah ****||** Gold, and the various *aabharanaas*, or jewelleries made of gold, like *makuta, **karnika*, crown, bangles - they are all said to be golden only. When we see the different ornaments made with gold, we say that everything is golden only. In the same way, the gods, animals, humans, the variety that we see, *Hari * Himself is told; *Hari * is existing in all these forms, *deva, pashu, pakshi, manushya*; everything is *Hari * only, everything is *Bhagavadaatmaka*. 



The various ornaments made of gold are recognized as the same gold. In the same way, *Hari * who is the inner self of all the different kinds of forms that we see in this world, like *sura, pashu, manuja*, etc., the gods, animals, humans. He is the same inner self in all the beings, He is said to be the one *Hari * only. This is like *kaarya-kaarana sambandha*. As in the *Upanishads, "Ekena lohamaninaa sarvam **lohamayam syaat, ... lohamityeva satyam*", everything is said to be golden, golden bangle, golden crown, etc. In the same way, *Bhagavaan * is the *antaraatma * of everything. Knowing the golden nugget which is the cause, we can know all the effects of the gold; in the same way, *Hari * who is the *kaarana*, or cause of everything, is present as the inner self of all the beings; so everything is said to be *Bhagavadaatmaka*. The one *Hari * is present in everything as the Inner Self.

The golden nugget which is the cause, which is there in each ornament, but everything is told as the same gold, all are golden. In the same way, *Hari * who is the cause of everything, the various differences that we see as *sura, pashu, manuja *- He is the one inner self of everything. He is present in everything, pervading in everything being the sole Cause of everything. He is the Lord of all. *Yama * is telling that He is the Lord of everyone, and is also my Lord.

In the same way, all the different beings, *sura, pashu, manushya*, in the end go and merge into the *Bhagavaan*, become one with *Bhagavaan*. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Atha tasya samhartrutvam aaha kshititala iti | Anilaante utthaapaka anila ****avasaane, kalusham kaalushyam, eeshvara sankalpa kruta guna vaishamyena ****utthaapitaah suraadayah tasya guna kaalushyasya naashe tamah shareerena ****tena sanaatanena ekataam yaanti | **In the previous *shloka, kaaranatva * was told. Here, *samhartrutva * is told. He is the one who withdraws everything unto Himself during *pralaya*, or when the beings die. Wind blows and throws up all the dust. *Sura, nara, pashu*, are all created during *srushti * by *Bhagavaan*; during *srushti*, the *avyakta*, which is the *nitya **dravya*, is present always, as *pradhaana*, this is the unmanifest *achetana *- this is made of three *gunaas - sattva, rajas, tamas*. When all three *sattva, rajas, **tamas * are in equal proportion, *pralaya * happens. When any one of them becomes more or less, immediately at that point, creation happens. This is like a huge ocean, where at some place there is a tide, some place there is a bubble, this huge prakruti, *moola prakruti * or *pradhaana, avyakta*, at some place, *sattva, rajas, **tamas * become uneven, due to *Bhagavat sankalpa; Bhagavaan * does *sankalpa*, because *achetana * cannot act by itself, it has not *jnyaatrutva, kartrutva*. Due to *Bhagavat sankalpa*, if there is difference in the *sattva, rajas, tamas * proportion, immediately there is creation, *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, panchabhootaas, **deha, indriya*, and all the *deva, manushya, pashu*, are all created. This is *srushti*. During *pralaya*, the unevenness in *sattva, rajas, tamas * will be destroyed, and *prakruti * becomes equal. Everything will merge in the backward order - *pancha **bhootaas * will merge into *tanmaatraas*, which merge into *ahamkaara*, which merges in *mahat tattva*, which merges into *prakruti, pradhaana*, and all www.sadagopan.org  [[75]] of 219 



Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



the *chetanaas * go and join together, and become united with *Bhagavaan * as *tamah **pare deve ekee bhavati*, which is *tamas shareera*. They go and join with *ekee **bhaava*, as though it is not two, but one. 



By the above two *shlokaas, kaaranatva*, and *samhartrutva * are told. *Yama * is telling his *bhata * about this, the glory of *Bhagavaan*, that He is the one who controls. Those who have taken refuge in Him, don't even go near them. *Yama * is warning him very secretly. While telling this, he is telling the glory of *Bhagavaan*, that He is the Lord of everything. He is the sole creator, and everything merges into Him during *pralaya*.   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 18: ****Harim amara \(ganaa\) varaachitaanghri padmam pranamati yah paramaarthato hi ****martyah | ****Tam apagata samasta paapa bandham vraja parihrutya yathaa agnimaajyasiktam ****||** *Hari's * Lotus Feet are worshipped by all the excellent gods, that Hari; that human who surrenders unto that *Hari*, with a *paramaarthataa*, thinking that He is the Ultimate Reality, for the Ultimate benefit, that person, gets rid of all the sins immediately; and that person who has surrendered unto the Lord and got rid of all his sins, just leave him and run away from him. He is as pure as fire which is glowing with huge flames, increased by the aahuti, ghee which is poured into the Agni, because of which Agni is glowing with huge flames. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Harim iti | Paramaarthatah nirupaadhikam | Agni drushtaanto bhakta ****samsarginaam api parihaaraarthah | ***Paramaartha * means without any *upaadhis. Bhagavaan * is the *nirupaadhika bandhu, **nirupaadhika pitaa, bhraataa*, everything; understanding this, one who surrenders unto Him. *Aajya * is poured into *Agni*, that also becomes pure, and *Agni * is pure by itself. *Bhagavad bhaktaas * are as pure as *agni*. Those who come in contact are also pure.

He is equally disposed towards himself, his friends and enemies. He does not steal from anyone. He does not hurt anyone. He does not kill any being.

There are two *paathaantaraas - sthita manasam * and *sita manasam*. * **Na prahrushyati sammane na avamaanena anutapyate | **Gangaa hrudaya akshobhyah* He is not happy when someone honours him, and not get depressed when someone ridicules him. He is steady like a huge pond of *Ganga*. He has a steady mind. 



*Ramayana * has a nice example. When *Vaalmiki * tells *Bharadvaaja*, looking at the *Tamasaa teertha*, where he wants to take bath, that "This water is so pure and clear that it brings me to my mind, about the mind of a devotee of God, which is so pure and clear". This is *sita manasam*.

Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Kali kalusha iti | Kali kalusham kali kaalushyam raaga dveshaadi, tat eva malam ****|** *Kali kalusha * means *Kali kaalushya*, which is defects which come due to *Kaliyuga, **raaga, dvesha*, etc.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3 



*Yama * explains how one who is following all the *varna aashrama dharmaas*, who treats everyone equally, who is not interested in others properties, money, or even if he sees gold in secrecy, he treats as a blade of grass, and who is always meditating upon *Achyuta, Ananta, Vishnu *- don't even go near such a devotee of Vishnu.

Such a *Vishnu*, if He is firmly established in the minds of humans, how can defects like jealousy and others have a place there? In whose minds, *Vishnu * who is so pure, as the *shilaa * of a *sphatika giri*, like the mountain of *sphatika*, is completely filling the mind, where is the place for any defect at all like *matsara * and others. The moon, the flood of cool moon rays, when that is there, in front of them, the heap of *hutaashana, Agni * which is having huge flames also, does not stand. In the same way, devotees of *Vishnu*, in whose mind, *Vishnu * who is without any defects, and is pure as the mountain of *sphatika*, He is established, there will be no defect at all, like *matsara * and others. When *Vishnu * is there, established in the mind of a person, how can there be any defect at all, like *matsara * and others, because *Vishnu * is as pure as a rock taken from a mountain of crystal; it does not have any defects, and it has all the good qualities. Like this, *Mahaa Vishnu * is *akhila heya pratibhata*, and is *sakala kalyaana **gunaatmaka*. When such a person is there in the mind, firmly established, how can there be a place for any defect at all? It is just like the cool flood of rays of moon, when it is flowing, how can even the heat of a glowing flame affect one? 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Sphatika iti | Sakala dosha pratibhate kalyaana gunaatmake bhagavati manasi ****sthite nrunaam matsara aadi dosho na bhavati iti arthah | Na hi ityaadi | Vasati ****iti sheshah | ***Bhagavaan * who is so pure, means He can dispel defects from distance itself, He rejects all defects from a distance itself, He is an ocean of all auspicious qualities. When that *Bhagavaan * is filling the mind, for such a person, the *matsara * and other *doshaas * can never find a place in their minds. Just as flood of cool rays of the moon, the heat of fire will not stay, just like that, he says. 



Like this, *Yama * further continues to tell the *lakshanaas * of *Vaishnavaas*, who are all the time meditating on *Bhagavaan*, whose mind is filled with *Bhagavaan*. Such a *Bhagavaan * who is *akhila heya pratibhata*, and *sakala kalyaana gunaatmaka*. This is how to recognize *vaishnavaas*. Those who are not the devotees of *Vishnu *- about these, will come next. We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 7, where the *lakshana * of the devotees of *Mahaavishnu*, are explained by *Yama * to his *bhata*, and he cautions www.sadagopan.org  [[78]] of 219

Who taught you?". This reflects the knowledge which is inside, *Bhagavaan * who is inside, in the mind of a person, is reflected outside in the external appearance of the person itself. The young tender sprout of *Saala * plant, is most beautiful, pleasant; with its look itself, it indicates the beautiful essence in the earth. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 26: ****Yama niyama vidhoota kalmashaanaam anudinam achyuta sakta maanasaanaam ****| ****Apagata mada maana matsaraanaam vraja bhata dooratarena maanavaanaam || ***Yama * tells his *bhata *- Those yogis who have got rid of all the defects of the mind, by practice of *Ashtaanga Yoga - Yama, Niyama, Aasana*, etc., and are of pure mind, and are meditating on *Bhagavaan * all the time, with utmost devotion and love; and because of that only, they have no arrogance or wrong notion, no *abhimaana*, no *matsara*, no *dosha*, with all the *doshaas * destroyed - from a distance itself, you will be able to recognize them.

When *Ananta * is firmly established in the mind, this kind of an understanding becomes unshaken in one persons mind. When one meditates on *Ananta*, and establishes Him firmly in the mind, for such a person, there is a clear understanding that everything is *Bhagavadaatamaka*, and he sees *Bhagavaan * everywhere. Don't even go near such a person, just run away from a distance itself. From a distance itself, you can recognize them. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Bhaktasya lakshanaantaram aaha sakalam iti |** **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 33: ****Kamalanayana vaasudeva vishno dharanihara achyuta shankha chakra paane | ****Bhava sharanam iteerayanti ye vai tyaja bhata dooratarena taan apaapaan || **Those who always keep pronouncing that *Bhagavaan*, who has Lotus Eyes, who is *Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Dharanidhara*, One who is holding the divine *Shankha * and *Chakra*, "You are the refuge for me, please become my refuge, I am surrendering unto You", one who says like this, just run away from such a person. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Kamala nayana iti | Eerayanti iti vachanaat artha jnyaanam antarena api naama ****ucchaarana maatram eva paapa haram iti soochitam | Eeranam shravanaadeh ****api upalakshanam |** Even if one does not understand the meanings of the words *Kamalanayana, **Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Dharanidhara, Achyuta, Shankha Chakra Paane*, but simply keeps telling that, and says "You are the Ultimate Refuge for me, I seek refuge in Your Lotus Feet". One who says this, without even knowing the meanings of all these words, just run away from such a person. They are without any sins, they are very pure devotees of *Vishnu*. By mere pronouncing of the names of *Bhagavaan*, all the sins get destroyed. Pronouncing is also *upalakshana * to *shravana*, it also indicates *shravana*. This is why from the very beginning, *Yama * is clearly telling the *bhata * in a low, hushed voice, in his ears, that nobody else should listen to that. Because even if www.sadagopan.org  [[82]] of 219

one listens to these things, sins will get destroyed, and there will be nobody in *naraka * for him to rule over. Even listening to *Bhagavaan's * name is due to great *punya*, and *shravana * itself is *alabhya*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 34: ****Vasati manasi yasya sah avyayaatmaa purushavarasya na tasya drushti paate | ****Tava gatih atha vaa mamaasti chakra pratihata veerya balasya sah anyalokyah ****||** That *Parama Purusha * who is *Mahaa Vishnu*, who is established firmly in one's mind, such an excellent person, a *purusha vara *- you cannot go near his sight also, or even I cannot go \(says *Yama*\). **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Vasati iti | Yasya manasi harih vasati tasya yaavat drushtipaatam chakram ****paribhramati, atah tat drushtipaate tat pratihata veerya balasya tava mama vaa ****gatih naasti | Sa tu anya lokyah - anya lokaarhah, na tu asmat lokaarhah, \* Na ****khalu bhagavataa yamavishayam gacchanti iti vachanaat | **As long as he can see, as long as his sight reaches, for the entire distance, there is a *chakra * which is guarding him. *Bhagavaan's Sudarshana Chakra * is protecting them, as long as they can see.

Because of this idea, a *mumukshu * is performing all the *karmaas*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Nanu varna aashrama dharmo yadi devataa vishayah katham asya bhagavat ****aaraadhanatvam iti atra aaha yajan iti | iti smruteh | **In *yajnyaas*, we see other deity's names only like *Soorya, Indra, Varuna, Agni, **Soma*, etc. If it is all about *devataas*, how can it be *bhagavat aaraadhana*?

**eva kounteya yajanti avidhipoorvakam | iti \* gaavo hi dvija mukhyaah cha \* ****ityaadi cha |** Those who are devoted to other deities, like they want to worship only *Agni, **Varuna, Indra, Soma*, worshipping them with great *shraddhe*, they will also be worshipping Me only, indirectly. If it is *vidhi poorvaka*, they will be worshipping directly the *antaryaami Paramaatman * only; and will get the ultimate benefit. But, even if they are worshipping other gods, they will be indirectly worshipping Me only. Everything is *Bhagavaan * is clearly told in many *pramaanaas*. If they are doing *yajnyaas * also, that will all become *Bhagavaan's aaraadhane * only, as He is *antaryaami * to everyone, *sarva bhoota antaraatmaa*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 11: ****Tasmaat sadaachaaravataa purushena janaardanah | ****Aaraadhyate sva varna ukta dharma anushthaana kaarinaa || **Just because it is told in the *Vedaas*, every *karma * one cannot perform.

One who is following the *shaastraas*, whatever is told for his *varna-aashrama*, that only he has to perform. *Sadaachaara * is the most important one. One who is established in *sadaachaara*, he will be performing the worship of *Mahaavishnu*, according to following his *varna * and *aashrama dharmaas*. Many things are told in the *Vedaas*, but he has to follow what is told for his *varna * and his dharma. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 12: ****Braahmanah kshatriyo vaishyah shoodrah cha pruthiveepate | ****Sva dharma tatparo vishnum aaraadhayati na anyathaa ||** *Braahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya * and *Shoodra*, being engaged in their *sva dharma*, that which belongs to their *varna * and *aashrama*, that is how they have to worship *Vishnu*, and not in any other way.

Here onwards, the qualities which one should cultivate, and which one should give up, are going to be told. Further, the *varna aashrama dharmaas * are going to be told. We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 8, where *Paraasharar * is telling *Maitreyar * about the *Varna Aashrama dharmaas*. To start with, in this *adhyaaya*, he is going to talk about the *varna dharmaas*. The *aashrama dharmaas * are going to be told in detail in the next chapter. *Sri Paraasharar * tells *Maitreyar * what he heard *Ourva rishi * telling *Sagara*. In the very beginning, *Ourva rishi * gives importance to practice of *varna aashrama **dharma*, the duties of one's station in life. The four classes are told - *Braahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya * and *Shoodra*. Their *dharmaas*, whatever is told for their classes - the *Braahmana * has to follow the *Braahmana dharma, Kshatriya * has to follow the *Kshatriya dharma, *www.sadagopan.org  [[89]] of 219

*Vaishyaas * and *Shoodraas * also like this. Being fully established in the *dharmaas*, the practices that are told - according to what is prescribed for their *dharmaas*, one should be following that only, and only then he has to worship *Vishnu*. Through all these *dharmaas*, he worships with the idea that this is all worship of *Vishnu * only. These are some of the qualities that one has to inculcate, these are very important. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 13: ****Paraapavaadam paishunyam anrutam cha na bhaashate | ****Anya udvegakaram vaapi toshyate tena keshavah ||** Not abusing others, no calumny, no untruthfulness, nothing which creates stress for others, if one follows this, then only *Keshava * will be pleased.

One should not follow that which is outside the *shaastraas*, even if he has utmost *shraddhe*. This question is also answered by *Krishna * in *Bhagavad-Geeta*, when *Arjuna * asks - If a person has great *shraddhaa*, but does not do what is told in the *shaastraas*, what happens to him; *Krishna * says that this is not allowed, this is *ashaastram aasuram*, He says.

In case of difficulties, a *Braahmana * can take up a *Kshaastra karma*. A *Kshatriya * can take up a *Vaishya karma*. A *Vaishya * can take a *Shoodra karma*. A *Braahmana * and *Kshatriya * should never take a *Shoodra karma*.; this is not prescribed for them even in *aapat*, it is told. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 40: ****Saamarthye sati tat tyaajyam ubhaabhyaam api paarthiva | ****Tat eva aapadi kartavyam na kuryaat karma sankaram ||** Whatever is told as *aapat dharma*, is to be done only when *saamarthya * is not there. Whenever there is *saamarthya*, this *aapat dharma * is to be given up. When there is *aapat*, he has to do the other *dharmaas * only. When a *Brahmin * is in trouble and is not able to do *Braahmana dharma*, he can do *Kshatriya dharma*. But, again, if he gets back the capability, and is able to do *Braahmana dharma*, he has to give up the *aapat dharma*, and take up his *varna **dharma*. Otherwise there will be *karma sankara*, it is told. When *saamarthya * is not there, then also if he does *Braahmana dharma*, then also it is *karma sankara*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Saamarthya iti | Ubhaabhyaam braahmana raajanyaabhyaam, saamarthye sati ****shaktou satyaam, tat - aapatkarma, tyaajyam | **For *Brahmins * and *Kshatriyaas*, when they are capable, then the *aapat karma * is to be given up; and he has to do his *mukhya kalpa * only. **Shaktasya anukalpa aashrayah, ashaktasya mukhya kalpa nibandhah cha karma ****sankarah, vruttyoh vyatikaro vaa |** For a *Brahmin, Braahmana dharma * is *mukhya kalpa*, and *Kshatriya **dharma * is *anukalpa*.

When he has *saamarthya*, if he does *Kshatriya karma*; or when he does not have *saamarthya*, if he tries to do *mukha kalpa*, then both lead to *karma sankara*, it is told; it will be the wrong thing to do. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 41: ****Iti ete kathitaa raajan varna dharmaa mayaa tava | ****Dharmaan aashraminaam samyak bruvato me nishaamaya ||** *Ourva Rishi * is telling *Sagara Raaja *- O King, I have told you now all the *varna **dharmaas*.

These are the *dharmaas * for *Brahmachaari aashrama*. Next the *Gruhasta aashrama **dharmaas*, which we see next. We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 9, where *Ourva Rishi * is teaching *Sagara*, and this is being told by *Paraasharar * to *Maitreyar*. After knowing about *varna **dharmaas*, King *Sagara * asks about *Aashrama dharmaas*. We had seen how a *Brahmachaari * should lead his life. After doing *upanayana*, he has to stay with a *Guru * and learn the *Vedaas*, and he has to follow all the *vidhis * and *nishedhaas * which are told, as per the *shaastraas*. He has to do all kinds of service to his *Guru*. He has to study whenever he has time. He has to do his *nitya karmaas*, and has to follow his *aachaarya * in every possible way, and should not do anything negative. First the *aachaarya * takes bath, and in the same waters, the *Brahmachaari * should take bath. He has to go to the forest nearby, and get the *samit, jala, kusha*, etc., whatever is required by the *aachaarya * for his daily duties. After having completed his studies, he should take the permission of his *Guru * and enter *gruhasta aashrama*, having given the *Gurudakshinaa*. Now, *Ourva Rishi * continues to tell about the *gruhasta aashrama*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 8: ****Vidhinaa avaapta daarah tu dhanam praapya sva karmanaa | ****Gruhastha kaaryam akhilam kuryaat bhoopaala shaktitah || **As per the *vidhi * told in the *Shrutis * and *Smrutis*, one has to accept a wife and get married.

the *bhoota ganaas*. These are all told in the *shaastraas*. One who is following all of these, with his own duties which are told as per the *shaastras*, performing all of this regularly, he will get all good benefits, and will enjoy in all the *lokaas*, as the *phala*. *Vaatsalya * is *dosha adarshitva*, not looking at the defects in others. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Bhootaani iti | Nija karma samaarjitaan sveeya karma saadhitaan ****praajaapatyaadeen | \* Sarva ete punya lokaah bhavanti \* iti shrutou, \* ya etaan ****avyagro yathaa upadesham kurute nitya svargah prushtah cha \* iti smrutou cha ****nityaanaam pratyavaaya vyatirekam phalaantarasya cha ukteh |** He will take *praajaapatya loka * and the *phalaas * are told for these *karmaas * also.

He will not be punished by *Bhagavaan * for not doing these. *Vedaas * prescribe the *nitya **naimittika karmaas*, which if one does not do, they will be subjected to punishment, they will have to suffer because of transgressing the *shaastraas*. Some of them, if done, there are some benefits also. If someone is interested in doing that, they can get those *lokaas * and enjoy there. This is also told. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 11: ****Bhikshaa bhujah cha ye kechit parivraat brahmachaarinah | ****Te api atra eva pratishthante gaarhastyam tena vai param || **There are some *Brahmins * who live only by taking alms from others, *bhikshe*; some of them are *Brahmachaaris * and they also have *gruhasthaashrama * as the *aashraya **\(Gruhasthaas * provide them all the support, as they are always depending on *bhikshaa * for living; they go from place to place, supported by *gruhasthaas*\). This is why *gruhasthaashrama * is said to be a good *aashrama*, where they support the other *aashramaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 12: ****Vedaaharana kaaryaaya teertha snaanaaya cha prabho | ****Atanti vasudhaam vipraah pruthivee darshanaaya cha ||** These *Brahmins*, in order to learn the *Vedaas*, go from place to place, from one *aachaarya * to another *aachaarya*, to learn. To perform *teertha snaana*, they visit all *teertha kshetraas*. They go around all places on the earth. They go around to see the *punya kshetraas*. They don't stay in one place. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 13: ****Aniketaa hi anaahaaraa yatra saayam gruhaah cha ye | ****Teshaam gruhasthah sarveshaam pratishthaa yonireva cha ||** They don't have a house, a place to live.

Because they provide food, they are said to be *yoni*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 14: ****Teshaam svaagata daanaadi vaktavyam madhuram nrupa | ****Gruha aagataanaam dadyaat cha shayana aasana bhojanam ||** Whenever a *gruhastha * sees such a person, a *parivraat * or *Brahmachaari*, roaming around like this, with the objective of learning the *Vedaas, teertha snaanaas*, when such people come, they have to be well treated and respected. They have to be looked after very well by *gruhasthaas*. They have to welcome the *Brahmachaaris * with nice words. Whoever comes, they have to be given a good place to rest, stay, and food has to be provided by the *gruhasthaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 15: ****Atithih yasya bhagnaasho gruhaat pratinivartate | ****Sa dattvaa dushkrutam tasmai punyam aadaaya gacchati ||** If an *atithi * is not happy with the service provided by a *gruhastha*, it will be very bad for the *gruhastha*.

Whatever is told for each *varna*, that, *nitya karmaas * and such things if one does not do, they will get *pratyavaaya*, undergo some punishment by *Bhagavaan * because of transgressing the *vidhis * of the *Vedaas*. By following all of these, they will avoid all such *pratyavaayaas*. If *pratyavaaya * comes, they cannot attain those *lokaas *- these *pratibandhaas * will not be there when one follows all these things. *Vaanaprastha aashrama * is going to be told now. *Brahmacharya * was told. *Gruhastha aashrama * was told where *atithi satkaara * was told in detail, and the *nitya naimittika karmaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 18: ****Vayah parinatou raajan krutakrutyo gruhaashramee | ****Putreshu bhaaryaam nikshipya vanam gacchet sahaiva vaa || **One who is a *gruhasta*, when he becomes old, having done all the *gruhasta **dharmaas * properly, he has to make his sons take care of his wife, and has to go to the forest; or he can also take his wife along with him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 19: ****Parna moola phala aahaarah keshashmashru jataadharah | ****Bhoomishaayee bhavet tatra munih sarvaartha nispruhah ||** Having gone to the forest, he has to live on what is available there - the leaves of the plant, the roots, fruits.

*Atithi * means there is no specific *tithi * on which he comes. He can come any time, any day, uninvited guest. One who comes for a *dharma kaarya*, one who is a new *atithi*, who has not come earlier - all others are *abhyaagataas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 22: ****Vanya snehena gaatraanaam abhyangah cha asya shasyate | ****Tapah cha tasya raajendra sheeta ushna aadi sahishnutaa || **He has to live with the material and other things available there only in the forest - his food, clothes, sleeping on the ground.

This itself becomes tapas for him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 23: ****Yah tu etaam niyatah charyaam vaanaprasthah charet munih | ****Sa dahati agnivat doshaan jayet lokaan cha shaashvataan || **A *muni * who performs all these things, regularly without breaking, as described in the *shaastraas*, he will burn all his defects, as though the fire burns everything.

One who sells soma *rasa*. An *Agnihotri * daily protects the *Agni*. But, if he takes *Sannyaasaashrama*, then he has to give up *Agnihotra*. In one place in the *Vedaas*, it says that it is not good to give up *Agni*. But, in another place, because *Sannyaasa * is also ordained, this is alright. But, without any reason, if one gives up *Agni*, or one gives up *Vedaas*, such a person should not be invited for *shraaddha*. *Soma lathe * has to be bought in exchange for a one-year old cow. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Mitradhruk iti | Nisargaat kunakhee krushnadantah cha | **By birth, one who has crooked nails. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 15, Shloka 6: ****Abhishastah tathaa stenah pishunaa graamayaajakah | ****Bhrutakaadhyaapakah tadvat bhrutakaadhyaapitah cha yah ||** One who is rejected by society.

If a person who is called a *nagna * comes in sight of them, then it will not please *pitrus * and *devaas * in *shraaddha*.

In order to show how harmful it can be, *Paraasharar * starts to relate a story.

It is told in the *shaastraas * that if you a *paashandi*, after that, you have to see the Sun once, so that the sins will get washed. This is like a *praayaschitta*.
