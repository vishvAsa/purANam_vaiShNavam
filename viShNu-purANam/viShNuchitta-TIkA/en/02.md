It does not negate people attaining *moksha * in other places, but this is told to highlight the greatness of *Bhaarata varsha*. Even in other places which are not said to be *karma **bhoomi*, in order to attain *moksha*, one has to practice *Brahma vidyaa*; this *Brahma **vidyaa * can be practices even in other places. Even *devataas * are eligible for adopting *Brahma vidyaa*, and can attain *moksha*; this is established clearly in the *Brahma Sutraas*, as told by *Sootra kaara Baadaraayana*. People in other *lokaas * can also attain *moksha*, it is told; because they have a desire to attain, they have the capability to do *Brahma vidyaa*, so it is possible for them also; they also have *adhikaara * for *Brahma vidyaa*.

What was told earlier that there is no *Kruta, Tretaa yugaas * in *Kimpurusha * and the eight countries, and *Pushkara **dveepa * also, *karma * is not ordained. *Karma * is not negated also. One can follow *karma * if required, but it is not ordained like in *Bhaarata varsha*. In *Plaksha * and five islands, *karmaas * required for attaining fruits other than *moksha * are not ordained. In *Plaksha * and five *dveepaas*, the *karmaas * which are required for attaining *moksha*, are being performed there. It is going to be told later, when performing *karmaas * which are as told, according to the *punya * done earlier, they are given positions like *Vasishta * and others, they are called *aadhikaarika purushas*. It is asked about why *Vasishta * did not do *deha avasaana prapatti*, and attain *moksha*; they are *aadhikaarika purushaas*, they have performed much *punya*, and have been put in that position by *Paramaatman * in order to perform certain things, and also guide the people of the world. In order to spend the *adhikaara*, to exhaust it so that they can attain *moksha*, and also performing the *yaagaas*, etc., they get rid of all the remaining *karmaas * there. In *Plaksha * and other *dveepaas*, they also do *daana*, is also told. 



*Apavarga * means *moksha*. *Dharma, artha, kaama * is one, and *apavarga * is the other.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **From one side of *Meru* mountain up to the shell, 25 crores is half of the expanse of the *bhoomi*, 25 crores on one side and 25 crores on the other side, totalling 50 crore *yojanaas*. On the top and below also, it is the same thing, 50 crores. As *Suka * says, between *Soorya anda * and *gola*, it is 25 crores. Compared to the expanse of the *lokaas*, this is 2.5 crores and 3.5 lakhs, double that will be the measure of *Kaanchana bhoomi*, the land of gold, which is 5 crore and 7 lakhs. The remaining 17 crores should be taken as the measure of the *Tama kataaha*. Why *Paraasharar * is telling about these numbers, and the expanses of these islands and oceans is in order to generate *vairaagya*, and the greatness of *Bhagavaan*, who is the Creator of this whole world. If it is such a big expanse, where people are getting created, going through the cycle of births and deaths, how difficult it is to escape from this; one has to get *vairaagya*, various worlds told, various pleasures enjoyed, good things, again, people are in this *prakruti mandala * only, again and again. One should get *vairaagya * understanding all these things, to escape from *samsaara*. This is the purpose of telling these measures. And also to remind us of the greatness of the *Bhagavaan*. He is not very much interested in these numbers and calculations. In whatever way you want to know about the 50 crores, know it. Some people say that half the diameter is 50 crores, and they it has an expanse of 100 crores. This is told in *Varaaha Puraana * also. *Bhoo mandala * is 100 crores. This is told in *Shiva Rahasya, **Skanda Puraana*. 35 crores, 19 lakhs, 40 thousand *yojanaas*. It is said that there is a huge pit filled with water. 1 crore *yojanaas * is the *kataaha*. Between *Soorya **Anda * and *Kataaha*, there is 25 crore *yojanaas*. In *Bhaagavata*, there is also mention of *Soorya*. This is to be understood as the distance lighted by the rays of the Sun. *Shaastreeya angula * is 24 inches, here it is 12 inches; this way, 50 crores becomes 100 crores. Or, we can say that it is 50 crores in one kalpa, and 100 crores in another kalpa. 



We should not look at it that it is correct in one *Puraana * and incorrect in another. It can be difference in *kalpaas*. It can be different in *loukika maana * and *shaastreeya **maana*.

The greatness of *Paataala loka * is told. There is also description of *Ananta * who is bearing the whole earth. We are studying the 5th *Adhyaaya*, we were studying the description of the lower worlds - *Atala, Vitala, Nitala, Gabhastimat, Mahaatala, Sutala * and *Paataala*. These are the seven worlds, and these are also *bhoga bhoomis*. Those who live there enjoy all kinds of pleasures and enjoyment, and it is much better than heaven; this is what *Naarada * was telling, after having seen these *lokaas*. Those endowed with that kind of *punya * to be in those *lokaas*, enjoy different kinds of food, music.

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **difficult, and not everyone will proceed in forward births, where they can evolve and go to higher births, and finally attain *moksha*. One in thousand of the *sthaavaraas * may go and become a *krimi*, and one in thousand *krimis * may go to the next one, and so on. Beings in the earlier *janmaas*, will go to the succeeding ones, in that order. The meaning is that among those beings born in the preceding *janmaas*, only a very rare one will get the next *janma*. Only a very rare one will get better and better births. This is also told in *Vaayu Puraana*, one in thousand among the *sthaavaraas*, they become insects born of sweat. Out of those beings born in sweat, one in thousand only will become an aquatic being. In the two legged ones, one in thousand will be a *dhaarmika*. One in thousand among the *dhaarmikaas * may go to heaven, or the *Brahma Loka*. One in thousand among those in heaven will want to attain *moksha*. It is so difficult to get a *dhaarmika * who has attained *samatva*, even in the *dyu loka*. This shows how difficult it is to get a good *janma*, better and better *janmaas. Manushya janma * is high, and among them the *dhaarmikaas*, and then they become *mumukshus*, etc. *Vaayu Puraana * has also told that the four legged animals, only a very rare one will get out of that *janma*. But nobody knows who will get what *janma * next. One who has done a lot of *punya*, good deeds, may be will get *manushya janma*. Those with not very good *karmaas*, medium *karmaas*, what birth one gets, what fruits they get is very difficult to say, as there is so much variety, as told in *Aaditya Puraana*. The message that *Sri Paraasharar * is giving in these two *shlokaas * is how difficult it is for one to attain *moksha*, getting liberated from this *samsaara bandha*, and not to tell how many *jeevaas * are there in each *krama*, the measure or expanse of the *jeevaas*. It does not tell the number or count of the *jeevaas * in these different kinds of beings, because those who are in *svarga * and in *naraka * are innumerable. There are innumerable number of beings in heaven, and suffering in hell. All the beings are going in that order till they attain *moksha*. Once they get liberated, there is no further birth for them.

The next category of *paapa * which are of lesser degree, knowingly repeated again and again, are the next category of sins. The next category told as *svalpaani* here are those for which, the *praayaschittaas * can be done privately. The small *paapaas*, which one has done only once, out of ignorance, not knowingly, not telling someone, knowingly not told, or knowingly allowing someone to do some sin - these kind of sins. Page **78** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **If one does *Brahma hatya*, not knowingly, one has to do *praayaschitta * for 12 years; knowingly if one does *Brahma hatya*, it is twice that, 24 years; if it is repeated, knowingly, it is twice that, 48 years; if one has repeated again and again, it is twice that, 96 years. For one who encourages another to do, or knowingly helps one to do, one who has not directly done, it is one quarter less *praayaschitta*, compared to what is told for the actual doer. One who has had some benefit out of that, for him, it is half the *praayaschitta*. For one who permits, it is three-fourths less *praayaschitta*. For those who simply encourage, it is still less. Depending on the involvement, whether one is the actual doer, one who helped in some way, one who takes some benefit out of that, one who simply permits him to do, one who motivates - like this, there are different kinds of sins, *praayaschittaas * told. Those who have done *mahaa **paatakaas * out of ignorance, 12 years *praayaschitta * is told, that will cleanse the person. Those who have done knowingly, as told in the *Smrutis*, they can do all the *vyavahaaraas*, and they will not go to hell, if they do the *praayaschitta*. Even if it is twice the 12 years, for those who have done knowingly, for a doer, he will have to go and experience *naraka*. Those who know these kind of differences, the different kinds of involvement in various kinds of *paapaas*, whether it is knowingly done, or unknowingly done, whether it is repeated once, repeated many times, those who have encouraged them, those who have taken benefit out of them, etc., and the different kinds of *praayaschittaas * for the different kinds of sins, they are told as *tadvidah*. 



*Paraasharar * is telling that *Svaayambhuva Manu * and others who have told about the various sins and *praayaschittaas*, one has to follow that to get rid of the sins done. 





This is a *shloka * which we tell many times every day; is a very wonderful and important *shloka*. *

Anantaram \* Kva japo vaasudeva iti keertanasya prashamsanaat |*** This is a very great quality of *Bhagavannaamasmarana*, and is explained wonderfully here. Whatever *Svaayambhuva Manu * and others have told - various kinds of *praayaschittaas * for the different degrees of sins that people have done, for the direct doer, for one who encourages, knowingly, unknowingly, repeatedly, etc. - whatever *praayaschittaas * are told - they will make one get rid of only that particular sin. Like this, there may be hundreds of thousands of sins; if one starts to do *praayaschittaas*, any number of births will not be sufficient. One will be able to get rid of only that particular sin by performing that *praayaschitta. Sri Engal **Aalwaan * quotes *Shruti *- one who sins once, will do another sin; so a sinner has a tendency to do sin more and more; he will be sinning again and again. One will do a sin; he will do *praayaschitta*; he will do one more sin and one more *praayaschitta*. All the *praayaschittaas*, whether it is for big sins, or for mild sins, also in different *deshaas*, different *kaalaas*, one which destroys all the sins, irrespective of which place it is done, which time it is done, whether big sin or small sin, and that which will also prevent one from sinning again, from involving more and more in sin, and which will also give one *saakshaat moksha * itself, that which is superior to all the *praayaschittaas * combined together, that great *praayaschitta*, that which is very clearly told and accepted by all the *Upanishads, Shrutis, Smrutis, **Puraanaas * is * Krishnaanusmarana. Tapa * means *upavaasa * and others, *karma * is *yajnya, **daana*, etc. Meaning of *anusmarana * is uniquely explained here by Sri *Engal Aalwaan. **Anu * in * anusmarana * is in * Heenaartha * means that I am a very lowly being. *Anusmarana * means that I am a very lowly being, I am a *daasa abhoota*, one who has to do *kainkarya * to the master according to his wish at any point of time, one who is a slave, this kind of *anusandhaana * is the meaning of *anu * here. *Smarana * of *Krishna * is to be done with *sheshatva anusandhaana*, that I am *shesha bhoota * to *Bhagavaan, daasa bhoota * to *Bhagavaan*, one has to remember the *Bhagavannaama Krishna*. If you do not want to suffer, you have to always remember your *daasya*, your subservience to the Master, who is *Bhagavaan Krishna, **Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Hari. Hari * is the *svaami * and I am the *daasa*. You have to always remember your *svabhaava*, and also *Bhagavaan's svabhaava * and *svaroopa*. We are the *chetanaas * who are *shesha bhootaas, daasa bhootaas * to *Bhagavaan*. All the *aatmaas * are *daasa bhootaas * to *Paramaatman. Kshetrajnya * is a *jeevaatman*, one which has a *kshetra*, a body. That which cleanses a *kshetrajnya * of all his sins is the knowledge of nature and relationship with *Eeshvara*, the nature of *Eeshvara*, the nature of one's own self; this is the ultimate purity for him. How can one *Krishna **anusmarana * be superior to all the *praayaschittaas *- it is superior to all *praayaschittaas * told for whatever sin one has done at any place and any time, it will prevent one from sinning again, and it also leads to *moksha*, it is told as param; it Page **80** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **is told that in the Upanishads, one spark of fire is enough to burn a huge mass of cotton completely without any residue, just like this, one *anusmarana * of *Krishna * can burn all the sins, so it is superior to all the *praayaschittaas*. This *anusmarana * is also an indication of *keertana, smarana*, and others told in *navavidha bhakti*. It will come later about *japa, keertana*. 



*Desha, kaala, * etc. also decide the degree of sin. For example, if one does sin in *punya **kshetra*, the effect is much more, and more *praayaschitta * has to be done.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 6, Shloka 40:   
Krute paape anutaapo vai yasya pumsah prajaayate |   
Praayaschittam tu tasya ekam hari samsmaranam param ||*** For one who sins, repentance follows a sin. For one who repents for a sin, what is the *praayaschitta*? The superior *praayaschitta * is *Hari samsmarana * once only. For all the sins done, the most powerful and one *praayascitta*, which can cleanse one of all sins, is *Krishna anusmaranam*. The explanation for *anusmaranam * is *sheshatva **anusandhaana poorvaka smaranam*, that I am utterly subservient to *Bhagavaan **Krishna*. We have to think of our utter subservience to *Bhagavaan*, and utter the sacred name of *Bhagavaan Krishna*. For a person who repents and wants to get rid of the sins, just once, if he tells the name of *Hari*, all the *praayascitta * required to get rid of that sin is done. So the greatness of *Hari naama sankeertana*, is being extolled in these *shlokaas*.

Tasmaat atra anutaapasya na angatvam kintu adhikaari visheshanataa |*** There are some doubts which may come here, which are clarified by *Sri Engal **Aalwaan * here. The greatness of *smarana * and *keertana * is told. Day and night one who remembers *Bhagavaan*, for him all the *paapaas * will get destroyed. If one remembers during day, the *paapaas * get destroyed. If one remembers during night, the *paapaas * get destroyed. If one *smarana * can destroy the *paapaas*, why should one remember again and again? How can *paapa kshaya * happen again when all Page **81** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **the *paapaas * are destroyed? Such doubts come. Repeated remembrance destroys *paapa *- it seems it told like this. In some *Smrutis * it is told - without knowing, or simply if one is remembering, one who is not even in his proper consciousness but telling a *Bhagavat naama*; it is also told that once if one remembers only, it will destroy everything. In some places it told only once, and somewhere else, it is told that you have to repeat day and night. There seems to be some contradiction here. How can there be no contradiction? Whatever sins that are done, once if you do *smarana*, it will destroy, it is told. It will not stop at that, again one may sin, due to *praarabdha karma*; this also will be destroyed by *anusmarana*. If one does a bad deed, it creates a bad *samskaara * in him; the corresponding *vaasanaa * will come and again one will have a tendency to do more sins. This *samskaara * will be destroyed by *anusmarana*, so that he does not repeat the sin; it will prevent one from doing the sin; again doing the *smarana * will have this kind of effect. So there is no *virodha*. For those who have a repentance and for those who do not repent, is there a difference? For those who repent, is it only one *smarana*? For those who do not repent, it is again and again - is it like that? This is not the way it is. Those who repent only will do *prayaschitta*; and the *praayaschitta * is *Krishna anusmarana*. For one who repents, because of the repentance, for one who does *smarana*, repentance along with *smarana * is destroying the *paapa* - this is also not the meaning; repentance has no role there; repentance will only lead one to do *praayaschitta*; but *Bhagavat **Naama * itself is so powerful, it is so very capable that it is destroying the sins; it does not need anything else to support it; it is *vastu saamarthya*, like sunlight dispels darkness. Repentance is the qualification of an *adhikaari * for doing *praayaschitta*. One who is qualified by repentance will only do *praayaschitta*; it becomes an *adhikaari visheshana*, and not an *anga * for *anusmarana*. Some minor doubts, which may arise are being clarified, so that we are sure, and there are no doubt about the power and greatness of *naama samsmarana*, and all the *shlokaas * told here - in one *shloka*, it is told that just once remembrance is enough; another *shloka * says that we have to remember morning and evening, again and again; there seems to be some apparent contradiction; this is all clarified here, so that we clearly understand the meaning of these *shlokaas*. One who does *smarane * of *Bhagavaan * morning and night, for him all the sins will get destroyed. Repeating in the morning and night, again in the morning and night, and so on, doing *Hari naama samsmarana*. It seems to be meaning that it will destroy sins only if repeated like this. It is told at other place that without being aware, if one does *Hari **samsmarane*, or just once remembering His name, is also is enough. It is told that *smarana * and *keertana * done just once is enough, for all *paapaas * to get destroyed. There is no contradiction, was explained earlier. Once if you remember and tell *Bhagavaan's * name, it will destroy all accumulated sins so far, and repeated, will prevent one from getting that *samskaara*; the tendency to commit sins again and again will not be there by repeated *samsmarana*. The advantage of repeating the name of *Bhagavaan Hari * is that even this tendency will not be there; this is the Page **82** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **purpose of doing *smarana * in the morning, night, morning, night, etc. So, there is no contradiction there. It is not that one who repents only has to do many times, because one who repents only will do *praayaschitta*. The eligibility or qualification for one to do *praayaschitta * is that one should repent. If one does not repent, then he will not even think of *praayaschitta*. Repentance only qualifies someone to do *praayaschitta*, and it has no role to play in destruction of the sins. It is mere *Harinaama * which has the power to destroy the sins. Power of * Harinaama * is such that it destroys the sins, and there is no *apeksha * of anything else for that. *Anutaapa * is not an *anga * to the *praayaschitta*, but it is the qualification needed for a person to do *praayaschitta*. 



This is an important *shloka * and gives the greatness of *Bhagavannaamasmarana * which has got such wonderful power. There are more such *shlokaas * which come

Because of this, again and again doing *samsmarana*, the good *samskaara * generated by repeated *smarana*, destroys the bad *samskaara * which can again lead one to commit sins. The *samskaara * born by the repeated remembrance of *Bhagavat naama*, the *samskaara * generated from one is told, the others are also included. Even if one listens to *Bhagavannaama * being told, that itself will destroy one of all sins. *Hari **naama*, if it reaches our ears, that itself is enough to destroy all the sins. Very wonderfully *Sri Engal Aalwaan * explains here. *Shravana, keertana, smarana*, and all these, being done just once, even though there is no *drushta phala*, immediately one may not go to *moksha*; just like the husk of the grain has to be removed by beating it with a stick only, and then it is to be used in *yaaga*, then this *yaaga * will be done properly and one will attain *svarga*, the results will not be seen immediately; for the sins which were accumulated so far, earlier, before reciting the *naama*, one should not think that he has to repeat again and again as he has not seen the results immediately, because *shaastra * says that the sins will be destroyed. An example is given here - there is a cave in darkness for nobody knows for how long, from beginningless time, when one lights a lamp there, the darkness gets dispelled immediately; just like this, when one tells *Harinaama*, all the sins will get destroyed. In order to see that again and again we are not committing sins, after *Harinaama **ucchaarana*, which would have destroyed accumulated sins, till one perceives the *Brahman * directly and immediately, till attaining *moksha*, one has to keep repeating the name of *Hari*. The long darkness in the cave was dispelled by lighting a lamp; if that lamp is put off, the darkness can again come in; it needs to be kept burning till the sun rises, because the lamp will not be further required. Till we get *Bhagavat saakshaatkaara*, we have to keep repeating the name of *Hari. Manu **Dharma Shaastra, Manusmruti * are all *parama pramaana * for us, and are in accordance with the *Vedic * teachings only. For everything, *naama sankeertana * is the *praayaschitta*, was told, whereas in *Manusmruti*, etc., it is told that you have to Page **86** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **do the *praayaschitta * for twelve years, twenty four years, etc., which are very difficult to do; when there is a very easy *praayaschitta * like *naama sankeertana*; nobody will even try to do those twelve year *praayaschittaas*; so *Manu Shaastra * will become futile; the statements of *Manu * and others cannot become futile, this is a doubt. There is no contradiction here. Those who are interested in doing such *praayaschittaas*, and those who are turned away from *Bhagavaan*, and feel so bad having turned away from *Bhagavaan * that they want to do some difficult *praayaschitta * only to get rid of the sins, they have so much belief that they want to do only the twelve-year *praayascitta*, in order to make sure that they will always be remembering *Bhagavaan * after this; for such people, it is definitely useful. *Praayaschittaas * told by *Manu * and others have to be done with *shraddhaa*. Whereas, *Bhagavat smarana*, even though one does not have belief, even if someone is telling, becomes a *praayaschitta*, just like *Shishupaala. Shishupaala * was ridiculing *Bhagavaan Krishna*, but he attained *moksha * after that. Even though people have sinned a lot, and do not have a pure mind, even they, when they remember the name of *Hari*, the power of the *Hari naama sankeertana*, is itself such that it destroys the sins for whoever it is. When *smarana * itself does all the *paapa kshaya*, the *Paandavaas * were very much in the company of *Krishna * all the time; He was such a close guide and friend to them; *Yudhishthira*, *Arjuna * and even *Balaraama*, did *teerthayaatraa * and such things as *praayaschitta*, when smarana itself would have destroyed all the sins; they did it because those who are not aware of the power of naama sankeertana, who do not have proper devotion, for them, there has to be a way to get rid of their sins by doing *teerthayaatraa * etc.; this is to demonstrate to others who are not aware of this means, and who are not very devoted. In this *prakarana*, various names are told - *Hari, Vishnu, Naaraayana*; it is said that *Harinaama sankeertana * will destroy sins, *Naaraayana naama * will get one liberation, etc. All the names can help attain all the benefits, all the *purushaarthaas*, is the conclusion. Not that only *Vaasudeva naama * will help one, and not the others. There is a *prakarana * in *Vishnu Dharma*. Just like one *naama Vaasudeva*, all the *naamaas * are having the same power. There are many names, thousands of names of *Bhagavaan*, which are very helpful to the entire world. Some *Bhagavannaamaas * like *Vaasudeva, Achyuta*, are told to be helping one to attain *moksha*. And some other names of *Bhagavaan * are said to help attain *dharma, **kaama*, and other *purushaarthaas*, are also told. In the end it is concluded, whichever name one desires, he can use that name for any purpose. All the names are concluding in only one particular person *Sriman Naaraayana*, who is *Parabrahman*; so they all have the same meaning. All the names of *Bhagavaan * will help one to attain all the *purushaarthaas*. ***

Paapa * is called *naraka*, and *punya * is called *svarga * because it is the fruits of *paapa * and *punya * which are experienced in *naraka * and *svarga.

Because of *punya*, one will experience joy, and because of *paapa*, one may experience grief in the same particular thing. With respect to a particular aspect, it will be very favourable and bringing joy because of some *punya * only; this is said to be *sukha*. With respect to experience of the result of the sin done, one will experience sorrow, with respect to some aspect. Sin will not be favourable to the person; that only is sorrow.

The state of the mind will itself lead to attainment of Brahman. If one does *karmaas * with the feeling that it is not mine, I am not doing it, the fruits are not for me, this is a particular state of mind with which it is done; this leads one to liberation. If one is attached, then they will have to again experience the results of this. It will be told later in *Vishnu Puraana * that the mind only is the cause of *bandha * or *moksha * with respect to *samsaara*. Because of the state of the mind, the thinking, the *punya * or *paapa * generated are the cause of this. According to the *karma*, one will experience the results.

This is the *upaasanaa * or *prapatti*. This is told as *vidyaa* here.

We saw Chapter Six, of *Amsha * Two. *Sri Paraasharar * had explained the various *narakaas*, and what kind of sins will lead to those *narakaas*; he made a list of all the sins and *narakaas * that people get. In the end, he said that *svarga * and *naraka * are nothing but *punya paapa; svarga * is itself told as *punya*, because *punya * leads to *svarga*; and *paapa * is told as *naraka*, as *paapa * is the *kaarana * for one attaining *naraka*. Compared to the *sukha * of *moksha*, of attaining *Bhagavaan*, these are all due to *karma*; because of *karma*, one experiences *sukha * or *dukha * here. The *padaarthaas, vastus*, objects by themselves are not *sukha * or *dukha aatmaka*, but the experience of happiness, grief, etc. comes due to the *karma * of the particular *chetana*. The same object causes happiness to one, and grief to another. At different times, different states, different places, to the same person also, a particular thing causes *sukha * or *dukha*. It is not in the nature of those things, but it is due to the karma of the individual that this kind of experiences happen. 



One has to do *karma * which will not bind one. *Jnaanam eva param brahma*, was told. *Jnyaana * will lead to attainment of *Paramaatman. Mana eva manushyaanaam **kaaranam bandha mokshayoh*, will be told later. Depending on various aspects of the mind, *mano vruttis*, one gets interested, attached, etc.; this is what binds or releases one. Based on the karma only, one experiences the consequences of the *karma*, either *punya * or *paapa*. 



*Vidyaa * and *avidyaa * were told. *Vidyaa * is *upaasane * or *prapatti. Avidyaa * is *nitya **maimittika karmaas. Karmaas * done without any desire in the fruits, without the *anusandhaana * of *mamatva, kartrutva, sanga * and *phala*, with *tyaaga*, is said to be *avidyaa * here. 



After telling about the *pruthivi, bhoo loka, paataalaas*, and the *narakaas*, and the *samudraas, parvataas, dveepaas *- these were all told briefly, *Paraasharar * asks *Maitreyar *- 'What else do you wish to know'.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **The next *shlokaas * tell about *Paramaatman's jagat kaaranatva, upaadana kaaranatva*. * *



We are studying the seven *lokaas - Bhooh, Bhuvah*, etc. The description of these *lokaas * was given by *Sri Paraasharar * to *Maitreyar*. Beyond these *sapta lokaas*, there are *sapta aavaranaas * of *tattvaas, pancha mahaa bhoota tattvaas*, then the *ahamkaara tattva \(bhootaadi\)*, then the *mahat tattva*, and beyond this is *pradhaana, moola prakruti*. Within this *prakruti mandala*, all the *chetanaas * are united with *prakruti * very closely; every *chetana * has a body, *indriyaas*, etc.; they are so closely united that we cannot separate and see them; this is because of their *karmaas. Bhagavaan, Vishnu shakti * is supporting all of these, as *aadhaara*; they are all held together by Vishnu *shakti * only. Because of His *sankalpa, chetanaas * get associated with *prakruti*; and with His own grace, when they do *upaaya anusthaana*, they get liberated. *Bandha * and *moksha * are all because of *Bhagavaan's sankalpa*, and this is based on the *karmaas * of each *chetana*. 



At the time of creation, He creates the three *gunaas*, and when they become unequal, they start to create. Though *Bhagavaan * is controlling and supporting all these, *Bhagavaan * is untainted by their defects. 



From *moola prakruti*, everything is getting created, and so everything is *trigunaatmaka*. Just a a tree has branches, fruits, flowers, and then the seed is produced; from those seeds, more trees are produced, and all the trees have the same characteristics. In the same way, from *pradhaana, moola prakruti*, all these are modifications, all are created and everything is *trigunaatmaka*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 7, Shloka 35:   
Beejaat vruksha prarohena yathaa na apachayah taroh |

They are just present, but just because of space or time or water, it does not decide the nature of the tree; the seed decides the nature of the tree. Space and others which are there as the causes, don't get affected or modified when the seed grows into a tree. *Bhagavaan*, who is the *kaarana * for all these, His *sankalpa * is there, He is present, He does not get affected or involved in this creation, though He is one of the causes.

So they are all required for the seed to grow into a tree, but they don't get affected or modified in the process. In the same way, *Bhagavaan * is said to be the material cause, *upaadaana **kaarana * of everything. Though He is the material cause, He does not get modified or affected in any way, because all changes are happening in His *shareera. **Chetana * and *achetana * are present as His shareera. 



*Shareera*, does not mean hands, legs, eyes, etc. *Shareera * is by the three relationships. \(i\) He is *sheshi*, and everything is *shesha bhoota * to Him, existing for His use, His *prayojana*, \(ii\) He is the *niyaamaka*, controller, and everything is *niyaamya*, controlled, \(iii\) He is the *aadhaara*, supporter, and everything is *aadheya*, supported. This is true for all times. These are the three kinds of relationships which define the *shareera shareeri bhaava*. Changes are happening in His *shareera*, which are also *dravyaas*. He does not get affected in this. *Pradhaana, moola prakruti*, which is also His *shareera; vikaaraas * are all happening in that. Just like *kaala * and others, which don't get modified, though they are causes, just by mere presence, just like that, *Bhagavaan * does not get affected.

Between the south and north ends, there are tracks running east to west, there are tracks located, where the sun moves in the east track every single day, moving north to south, and south to north, as it moves gradually each day. 183 days one way, and 183 days other way, so 366 days in one year. Half the year is *Uttaraayana*, and half the year is *Dakshinaayana*.

One fourth of the *nakshatra mandala*, which is covered, in the western part, because he is located at a great distance, it looks as though he is touching the ground; because of that, they feel that he is rising on the eastern sky. At the same time, at places on the eastern part, they see the Sun on the western side at a distance, as though touching the ground, they think that he is going down, that the sun is setting, not seeing the sun.

At that time, *Sandhyaavandanaa * and other *karmaas * are done. *Agnihotra * is done in the morning. The same point is told in *Taittiriya Braahmana*. It is said that the brightness of Agni enters into the Sun, and the brightness of Sun enters into *Agni*. So, in *Agnihotra*, when they offer *aahuti*, they offer to both the gods *Agni * and *Surya*. Because when there are two respectable people, if we show respect to one and do not show respect to the other, it is as if the person to whom you have shown respect also is direspected, because the other person was not shown due respect. So, both Agni and Surya should be given *aahuti*. In morning and evening, for both aahuti is to be given. In *Vaayu Puraana*, it is told that one fourth part of brightness of the Sun enters into *Agni * in the night. In the same way, one fourth part of the *Agni * also enters into the Sun.

The measure of the circumference is said to be 9 crore, 45 lakhs *yojanaas*. Sun covers this distance every day. One *muhoorta * is said to be 31 lakh, and 50,000 *yojanaas*. When this is multiplied by 30, we get 9 crore, 45 lakhs *yojanaas*, which is the complete circumference. In the centre of the *Pushkara*, he is going around during *Dakshinaayana*.

This *jyotischakra * is rotating in the western direction. In the great axle, being held by the reins by *Dhruva*, the smaller axle and yoke are connected to other pair of *rashmis*. The two reins, by pulling towards and pulling against, according to *Dakshinaayana * and *Uttaraayana*, either to the northern direction or southern direction, one *mandala rekhaa * at a time, either the top or bottom portion, going up and going down, he is going round and covering the entire circumference. Inside part is near *Meru*, and outside part is near *Maanasottara*. Slowly, he is moving towards the eastern direction. In one month, he covers two and a quarter *nakshatraas*, which is one *raashi*. 183 solar days, he moves around in the same way. He will reach the edge on the great axle; and in the *nakshatra mandala*, thirteen and a half *nakshatraas*, six *raashis*, he covers this much distance. In this way, 366 days \(includes nights\), two *ayanaas*, six *rutus*, twelve months - one solar year is divided like this. In this 366 times, the rising and setting in the western direction happens. Once on the great axle he goes up and down, 27 *nakshatraas*, 12 *raashis*, the potters wheel is rotating, and insect is rotating opposite; in the same way, the Sun's movement is happening. Covering the *nakshatra **mandala*, daily moving in the western direction, and in the other direction, he moves by himself, the planets also move like that. Mars, *Angaaraka*, is located at a distance from the Sun; it can happen in the other direction also. Moon and others which are near the Sun, are being covered by the rays of the Sun; rising and setting of the moon happen because of the nearness to the Sun. It is said to enter into Sun's mandala, during the setting of the moon, and is *chandrodaya * happens when the Sun is at a distance; this is all told in *Shruti * and *Puraana*, which is not opposed to what is told here; and can be learnt from the *Jyotisshaastra*. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * makes and interesting remark here - The current year when this commentary was written, he is saying that there are 366 days now, and according to the *Kali * measure, 4,400 years, 365 and a quarter days. 



Now, it is 5120 after *Kali Yuga. Sri Engal Aalwaan's * time is second half of the twelfth Page **129** of **297

In between the *vishuvaas*, how the day and night increase and decrease is being told - the durations, space covered by the *raashis * are said to be different. We saw earlier that *Meena * and *Mesha * are small, so it takes less time to cover the two *raashis **Meena * and *Mesha*. *Vrushabha * and *Kumbha * are a little more than that, so that it takes more time for the Sun to cover these two. *Makara * and *Mithuna * are still more. *Simha * and *Vruschika * are still longer. *Dhanus * and *Karkataka * are longer. *Kanya * and *Tula * are equal. Based on this, whichever *raasi * is at the day beginning, the day and night durations keep changing. This is why we see differences in duration of day and night.

In *Uttaraayana*, he takes longer to cover the day. This is known through all the calculations in *Jyotisshaastra*. At the middle of *Uttaraayana * and *Dakshinaayana, **vishuvat * is when day and night are equal. The various cities were told earlier -*Indra's, Yama's, Varuna's, Soma's, Vibhaavari's*, etc. Different cities have different timings because of this only. 



Now, another important aspect is going to be explained - what happens between day and night. Night is told as *Usha * in *Vedaas. Vyushti * is said to be day. The last time, at the end of the night is *Usha kaala*. The beginning of the day is *Vyushti*. ***

Night and day - as told in the *Shrutis*, using those terminologies, *Ushaa * and *Vyushti, **Sri Paraasharar * is telling.

Importance of *Sandhyaa kaala*, why *Sandhyaavandana * is to be done, why *arghya * is to be given, what happens during giving of *arghya*, are going to be explained now. We will see next. 



We are studying *Amsha * 2, Chapter 8. We saw how based on the movement of the Sun in the various directions, they perceive dawn, setting, etc. based on their views, locations, though Sun is always shining and rotating. Also, in *Uttaraayana * and *Dakshinaayana*, how the duration of the day and night changes, was also explained. 



Next, *Sri Paraasharar * is going to tell the importance of *Sandhyaa kaala*.

When Sun is in *Maagha **maasa, Shukla paksha, trayodashi*, this is said to be *Vaasara. Samvatsara, Parivatsara, **Idvatsara, Anuvatsara * and *Vatsara * are the names of the five years. In *Vedaas*, third one is said to be *Idaa vatsara*, here it is said as *Idvatsara*. Fourth one is *Anuvatsara*, having *Indra * as the *devataa*. Fifth one is said to be *Idvatsara * in the *Vedaas*, having *Mrutyu * as the *devataa*, here it is said to be *Vatsara*. At the beginning of five years, all the four *Soura, Saavana, Chaandra, Naakshatra *- all coincide, and again start. The five years are denoted by the names *Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idvatsara, **Anuvatsara * and *Vatsara*. At the end of the five years, they again start. These are the four types of *maasaas * by which *yuga * is divided. *Lagadaachaarya *\(who has written the *Vedaanga Jyoutisha*\) has said the same thing. ***

It is told in the *Vaayu Puraana*, that north of the *Maanasa parvata*, in southern part, *Ksheeroda samudra * is there in the middle; between *Dakshina veethi * and *Ksheeroda*, the northern edge of *Shaaka dveepa*; whenever we see actually, whatever time, that is according to the five *samvatsaraas*, this will be explained in further *shlokaas*. In the *Maagha maasa, Jyeshtha*, when the Sun moves, in the middle of *Pushkara*, he moves in the *Dakshinaayana*. When he returns from *Dakshinaayana*, in the middle, *Vishuva*, he will start moving towards the north. In *Shraavana maasa*, he reaches the north edge. There is a notation of three *veethis, veethi-traya, Ujjayini, Lankaa, Dakshina*. What is told here - *Mesha, **Tulaa, Vishuva, Makara \(Nakra\)* \(in *Uttaraayana*\), *Karkata *\(in *Dakshinaayana*\), what is told here, is told in the older times. In 3600 *Kaliyuga*, it was like that. Now, presently, in 4400 *Kali Yuga, Vishuva * is seen in the 12th day, even before the *Makara **maasa*, and *Karka*, even before the Sun reaches them, *Vishuva * is observed.

There was also a time when *Maargasheersha * was at the beginning of the year, that was the time when *Triveethi * was there. Some people say that *Maargasheersha * is at the beginning of the year. *Kaatyaayana * has said that *Maargasheersha * is the beginning, and from there, two two months are one *rutu * each. *Amarasimha * also says a similar thing. *Mrugashira * is also called *Agrahaayani*, beginning of the year, *agram ayanam **asya*; even the *Poornima * there is said to be *Agrahaayani*. Now, we say that the beginning of year is *Maargasheersha*, is because of performing certain *vrataas*. In *Vedaas*, there is also a mention that *Phalguni * is the beginning of the year, this is because *yaaga * is performed at that time. *Madhu, Maaghava*, what the *Shrutis * tell, the year starts with *Chaitra Shukla pratipat*; this is established in *Shrutis, Smrutis, **ganita, vyavahaara, loka*, etc. One has to see *Shrutis, Smrutis, Ganita*, and all of that, and then establish the days. 



During *Tiruppavai*, we do *anusandhaana * that *Maargasheersha * is the *Usha: kaala*, that's why it is very sacred. ***

We are studying *Amsha * 2, Chapter 8, where the divisions of time were told by *Sri **Paraasharar * to *Maitreyar*. He was telling about the two *ayanaas - **Uttaraayana * and *Dakshinaayana*, and the middle part which is called *Vishuva*. ***

It was earlier known as *Mahaa Vishuva*, when Sun and Moon are in their *Vishuva * positions. Even at later times, or any other time, where the Sun and Moon are positioned like this, this is *Vishuva*, a very auspicious time, and very special time. Earlier, it was end of *Meena * and *Kanyaa*, when Sun and Moon were positioned, it was said to be a very auspicious time for charity. This is the conclusion - When Sun and Moon are in *Vishuva*, that has to be known from *Vedic * Astrology, Mathematics, and do charity, as it is very auspicious. ***

eshah ||*** The *dakshina maarga * is said to be *Dhoomaadi*. There are two - *Devayaana **\(Archiraadi\)* and *Pitruyaana \(Dhoomaadi\)*. It is told in *Chaandogya Upanishad * that those who do meditation on the *Paramaatman, Parabrahma upaasanaa*, when they meditate upon the *Tapah shabda vaachya Paramaatman * with *shraddhaa*, they attain the *Archiraadi maarga * and go to *moksha*. Those who live in the villages, as householders, who perform *Ishtaa *\(various *yajnya yaagaas*, sacrifices\), *Poortaa *\(humanitarian deeds like building water tanks\), *Datta *\(giving *daana*, charity\), they go to the deity of Smoke, *dhoomam*, the *Dhoomaabhimaani devataa*. From there, they go to the deity of night. From there, to the deity of *Krishna paksha*. From there to the *abhimaani **devataa * of *Dakshinaayana*. From there, they go to deity of *Samvatsara*. From there, they go to the world of manes, *Pitruloka*. From *Pitruloka*, they go to the deity of *Aakaasha*, then to the Moon. This is the food of the gods, the gods eat him, the gods get the service done by these people, so they use them like animals, as told in the *Upanishads*. After having spent all the *punyaas * accumulated, in performing *Ishtaa, Poortaa, Datta*, till the *punya * is spent, they live there, they serve the gods, live in their worlds and enjoy. When the *punya * is completed, exhausted, they return by the same route, up to *Aakaasha*. From *Aakaasha*, they go to *Vaayu*, then to *Dhooma*. This is the *Panchaagni Vidyaa * told in *Chaandogya Upanishad. **Dhooma, raatri, bahula, Dakshinaayana, Aakaasha*, Moon, *Diva*, and after that, when they come back, they go through *Aakaasha * first, then *Vaayu, Dhooma, Abhra *\(the previous state of cloud\), then the cloud itself, then rains, then *udbijya, vreehi*, grains, when a person eats that grain, and unites with a woman, it gets transferred to woman, and they are born again. This is told in *Panchaagni vidyaa*. Those who go by the *Pitruyaana*, they take this path. Those who take *Devayaana*, they go to *Moksha*. 



Here, another *Devayaana * is told. ***

To the north of the *rishis*, and also above, *Vishnu pada * which is supported by *Dhruva * is there. If you take the seven worlds - *Sapta lokaas, \(Bhooh, Bhuvah, Suvah, Mahah, Janah, Tapah, Satyam*\), this is said to be the position of the *hrudaya. Vairaaja * is *Chaturmukha Brahma*, the *Viraat purusha. Antaryaami, Parabrahma * is located in the *hrudaya *- this is the place where Vishnu lives. The *moksha * told in this *Vishnu pada * is *Krama mukti*; those who are here enjoy much more pleasures and happiness compared to even *svarga*, even though it is below *Satya loka. Krama mukti * means that they gradually do *upaasanaa*, and then attain *moksha*. Those who live there, in order, go and attain *Brahma loka*, and along with *Chaturmukha Brahma*, they also get liberated. Those who are in *Vishnu pada*, if they perform *upaasanaa * there itself, and attain that *jnyaana*, they also can get liberated. *Vishnu pada * itself is not the place attained by *muktaas*; it is not *saakshaat Parama Pada*. This is one of the steps in attaining *moksha*. 



The word *Parama pada * comes here, which is explained in the commentary. The next *shlokaas * tell about the worlds above the three worlds. 



We are studying *Amsha * 2, Chapter 8, where we studied about the various *lokaas * where *rishis * live, the *Vishnu Pada*, which is also told by the name *Paramapada * in these *shlokaas*.

One who hears about the *Gangaa * gets a great desire to see, take bath. One who has a great desire, goes and touches the waters, the next step is to drink the waters of *Gangaa*. For each step, the next step gets ten times more benefit; the fruits they attain are ten times of the previous one. This is told in *Brahmaanda Puraana*, those who are standing away Page **160** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **from the river also, but one who hears about *Gangaa * with devotion, there itself, *Gangaa * river, out of great compassion, makes them get rid of *samsaara * itself. "When will I see the *Gangaa * river, when will I get an opportunity to take bath in *Gangaa*?", one who desires like this, for such a person, ten *kulaas * of his will be blessed. For whatever reason one sees with great devotion the *Gangaa * river, *Gangaa * destroys the sins of hundred *kulaas* of such a person. Those who touch the waters of the river with great devotion, even once, *Gangaa * will bless thousand *kulaas * of them to cross over the *samsaara*. Dharma itself has taken the form of water, the *Gangaa * river, one who drinks that with great devotion, even once, *Gangaa * will make sure that ten thousand *kulaas * of them will cross over the ocean of *samsaara*, this is for sure. In the sacred river *Gangaa*, with great devotion, when one does *Avagaaha snaana *\(completely immersing in the waters\), one lakh *kulaas * of them will be blessed with crossing over the *samsaara*. Those who do *seva * every day with great devotion, and drink the sacred waters, ten lakh *kulaas * of them will cross over *samsaara*. This is the greatness of *Gangaa * told in *Brahmaanda **Puraana*.

This conclusion is told to tell about the greatness of the *Paada. Paataala * is also included in the three *lokaas*, and this is to give good *gati * to *Sagara's * children. *Gangaa * river has come from *Vishnu Pada*; there are so many rivers originating from places of very little significance compared to the sacred feet of *Saakshat Mahaa Vishnu*. They originate from some other river, or from a hill, which are very insignificant compared to the *Paada * of *Mahaa Vishnu*; this is indicated by *'tu' shabda. Gangaa * cannot be compared with ordinary rivers. Those who compare *Gangaa * river with other ordinary rivers, they commit sin, *dosha. Gangaa * has got *Vaishnavee Shakti*, coming from *Vishnu Paada*; those who think that *Gangaa * is similar to other rivers, one should not live with, or come in contact with such people. *Gangaa * should not even be told as *nadi, Gangaa * is so sacred; this is told in *Bhavishyat Puraana*.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **they say *shareera*, it is *Vedaabhimaani devataa. Shakti * and *Vishnu * are to be addressed in the same *vibhakti*, with coordination; in *saamaanaadhikaranya nirdesha*; because the power and one who has the power - both are one only. *Shareera * is not like hand and leg, but it is because of the three relations - *aadhaara - aadheya **bhaava, niyaamaka - niyaamya bhaava, sheshi - shesha bhaava*; this is *shareera-**shareeri bhaava. Shareera * is said to be *dravya; Vedaas * are said to be *shareera*, so the *Vedaabhimaani devataa * can be taken. *Vishnu * is present as *antaryaami*, the Inner Self of the Sun. Therefore, the prominence for the Sun. Sun only is addressed in all the acts. ***

In various other planets also, there are rains happening; these are also because of the Sun only. All other planets, in order to do *anugraha * for them, to grace them, the various rays of the Sun are told to be responsible for all that. It is told in *Koorma Puraana*, there is one ray, *rashmi * called *Harikesha*, which feeds the *nakshatraas*, the stars. There is another ray called *Vishvakarma*, which feeds *Budha. Vishvavyacha * is one which feeds *Shukra*. There is one called *Samyadvasu * which feeds the *lohita graha, Mangala. Bruhaspati*, Jupiter is fed by *Arvaavasu*. There is another called *Svaraahvaya * which feeds Saturn. 



In *Shruti * also, these names are told. Various rays of the Sun are feeding various other planets.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) *****Amaakhya rashmou vasati amaavaasyaa tatah smrutaa ||*** *Paraasharar * is telling why it is called as *Amaavaasyaa*, it means living in *Amaa*. He would be left with two *kalaas*, parts, at the end of the *Krushna Paksha*, he enters into the *Soorya Mandala*, and lives in one *rashmi * called *Amaa*. This is why it is called as *Amaavaasyaa*. ***

Therefore, it is said that during *Amaavaasyaa*, one should not pluck plants, or even *Tulasi*.

Now, continuing further, the various other planets, chariots, horses, are going to be described. 



We just concluded *Amsha * 2, Chapter 12, where we studied about the Moon, how the Sun gives *trupti * to everyone on the earth, through the plants, through the rains caused by the Sun. Through his rays, the *amrutamaya chandra*, the Moon, where Page **189** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **each *kalaa * is consumed by the *devaas * as *amruta*, and by the *pitrus * on the *Amaavaasyaa * day. In this way, the Sun is responsible for satisfying all of them, the *devaas, pitrus*, and the *manushyaas*. We saw the Moon's description, about how every planet has a ratha, chariot - this is going to be told now. 



The *devaas * consume *amruta * from the Moon only. During *Amaavaasya*, the *pitrus * consume. Through his *prakaasha*, as well as bringing joy to everyone, the Moon brings happiness to all the plants also, the humans, insects, etc. The Moon brings joy because of his pleasantness in the nights. 



The other planets, and their description is given next.

In this world, which is mixed with sentient and non-sentient, one who knows himself without any *jnyaana * or *pramaana*, having *jnyaana * only as the *svaroopa*, his essential nature is of consciousness, and he is indestructible, and that is why he is called as *Asti*; and the non-sentient part of the world, and it attains many forms due to the modifications it undergoes, because of the *karmaas * of the sentients, in order to give them the experience of the fruits of the *karmaas, \(deha, insriyaas, vishayaas*, are all given\), which are all modifications of *prakruti * only, it undergoes destruction \(there is no *svaroopa naasha*, but there is *svaroopa parinaama*\), it is called by the word *Naasti*. Both these are *shareera * for *Vaasudeva*, who is *Parabrahma*; both these have *Parabrahma, Vaasudeva * as their *aatma*. This is going to be told briefly. 



*Svasmai bhaasamaanastvam * is told. 



This world has two parts - sentient and non-sentient. 



*Shareera * is because of the three relationships - *Yasya chetanasya yat **dravyam, sarvaatmanaa svaarthe niyantum dhaarayitum cha yat **shakyam* that *sheshataika svaroopam cha tat tasya shareeram, itarah shareeri*. This is the *lakshana * told by *Sri Bhaashyakaarar * in *Sri Bhaashya * and *Vedaarthasangraha. **Shareera * is a *dravya*, under the control of the *shareeri*, that which is controlled, supported and meant for the purpose of the *shareeri*. One who controls, supports and is the Master, is the *shareeri*. This is the relationship. Everything is having Him as the self, this way, everything is His *shareera*. He is *aatma * for everything. 





This is an extremely important *shloka*, where the principle which is to be understood for all the remaining *shlokaas * is explained. What we have to understand first is explained. The next ten *shlokaas * are commented by *Bhaashyakaarar * in *Sri Bhaashya*. The commentary which we see here in *Sri Engal Aalwaan's vyaakhyaana*, is exactly same as what is found in *Sri Bhaashya*, 99 percent same. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 12, Shloka 37:   
Yat ambu vaishnavah kaayah tato vipra vasundharaa |   
Padmaakaaraa samudbhootaa parvata abdhi aadi samyutaa ||*** Water, is *shareera * of Vishnu, and because of water only, earth in the form of lotus, is Page **195** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **born. It has the mountains, oceans, etc. 



This is told in the *Shrutis*, for creation, *Aatmanah aakaashah sambhootah, aakaashaat **vaayuh, vaayoragnih, angeraapah, apbhyah pruthivee, pruthivyaa oshadhayah*. From waters, *pruthivi * is created, and it has got plants, rivers, etc. Water itself is the *shareera * of *Vishnu*. Earth which has come from water is also in the same way. 



*Saamaanaadhikaranya * is a very important concept in *Vedaanta. Bhinna pravrutti **nimittaanaam shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih saamaanaadhikaranyam*. This is told by the grammarian *KaiyaTa*. We agree with this definition and *Bhaashyakaarar * explains everything according to this. *Saamaanaadhikaranya * means words which are in the same *vibhakti*, indicate different *visheshana*, which denote different aspects of the same qualified object. A single object can be qualified by multiple attributes, which are not opposed to each other. *Visheshanaanaam vyaavartakatvaat*, is a commonly understood thing. Attributes actually eliminate others. If we say "He is a tall boy", it is understood that "He is not a short boy". The attribute Tall eliminates Short. If something is white, it eliminates black, red, blue, etc. Attributes are always of the nature of eliminating others. Other views, *pakshaas * say that multiple *visheshanaas*, attributes, cannot qualify the same object because they are all of the nature of elimination; so they have to qualify different objects is what they say, in *Satyam jnyaanam anantam brahma*; so they give a secondary meaning for all those words. But *Bhaashyakaarar * says that if they are not opposed to each other, there is nothing wrong in multiple attributes qualifying the same object. This is the meaning of *Saamaanaadhikaranya*. *Adhikarana * is the *visheshya*, and the *padaas * are all *visheshanaas*. Different *visheshanaas * which are not contradicting each other can qualify the same *visheshya. Ekasmin arthe vruttih*. They all qualify the same *artha*, object. Because everything is *shareera * of Vishnu, words which denote the *shareera*, can also denote the *shareeri. Shareera vaachaka shabda * also denotes the *shareeri*. This is why *saamaanaadhikaranya * is possible. 



Even for humans, when we say *Devadatta, Yajnyadatta*, it is not just the body outside which we are addressing, but also the *jeevaatman * who is inside, who is *visheshya. **Jeevaatman * who is qualified by the body is addressed as *Devadatta*. But, it is a *manushya shareera*, so *Devadatta * as a man addresses the *manushya jaati*, but also denotes the *shareeri * who is qualified by the *shareera*. This is why *Devadatta * can be used for either the *chetana * or the body. When we say *Devadattah sama parimaanah **yuvaa*, they are all different attributes not contradicting each other; one tells about his age, one tells about his being handsome, one tells about his colour. These are all different aspects qualifying the same object. This is how any word can be told in coordination with Vishnu because everything is His *shareera * only. This is what *Sri **Paraasharar * is telling; first he tells about everything is His *shareera*, then he tells in coordination that everything is *Vishnu * only. Page **196** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **



How can we say *saamaanaadhikaranya * with *Vishnu * for everything? This is because of the *shareera shareeri bhaava*. This is the most important thing we have to understand. First, *Paraasharar * made it clear that everything is *shareera * to *Vishnu*. And then, because of the *shareera aatma bhaava*, everything can be said to be in coordination with Vishnu in *Saamaanaadhikaranya*.

All are told in coordination, how is this to be understood? This is called *saamaanaadhikaranya*. By telling that water is *shareera * of *Vishnu*, that which is created is an effect of water, the *brahmaanda, vasundharaa, padmaakaaraa*, the lotus shaped *Brahmaanda*, which contains mountains, oceans, etc. is also an effect of that only, as it also is *shareera * of *Vishnu*. 



Because waters are *Vishnu's shareera*, the effect of that, the modifications of water, *Brahmaanda * is also *Vishnu's shareera. Vishnu * is *aatmaa * for that also, this is told in all the *shrutis*, and also here. *Vishnu Puraana * is *upabrahmana, vishadeekarana, Shruti vaakyaas * are explained in detail here. *Taadaatmya * is unity, that everything is one only - *Sarvam khalvidam **brahma*, that everything is *Brahman*. This *upadesha * is explained here in detail. The *taadaatmya * which is told in the *Shrutis*, these *shlokaas * are *upabrahmana * for that. These are the explanation for how we have to understand that. The *saamaanaadhikaranya*, concomitant coordination which will be told further, is to be understood. How can that happen, means that because of *shareera aatma **bhaava, saamaanaadhikaranya * is perfectly valid. This explains the *shrutis * which tell the *taadaatmya*. 



*Paraasharar * gives a few examples, and after that concludes with a generic statement - ' *yadasti yat naasti cha*'.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **All the luminary bodies are *Vishnu * only, the worlds are all *Vishnu*, forests are all *Vishnu*, the mountains, directions, rivers, oceans, everything is *Vishnu * only. Whatever is denoted by *asti shabda*, whatever is denoted by *naasti shabda*, all are Him only. 



There is nothing other than *asti * or *naasti*, everything is either *chetana * or *achetana*. There are only three realities, *chit, achit * and *Eeshvara*. Apart from *Eeshvara*, there are only two other realities - *chit * and *achit*. He first tells about all things we see around, various luminary bodies, stars, the worlds, forests, mountains, directions, rivers, oceans. *Paraasharar * says that they are all *Vishnu * only, *shareera * of Vishnu. This is told in coordination, *Saamaanaadhikaranya*. After mentioning a few things, anything that can be denoted as *asti shabda vaachya*, and anything which is *naasti shabda vaachya*, everything is *Vishnu * only. What are these *asti * and *naasti*, and why are they called so, is explained in the next few *shlokaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:***** *****Tat etat taadaatmyam saamaanaadhikaranyena vyapadishati jyoteemshi iti |   
Atra asti aatmakam naasti aatmakam cha jagat antargatam vastu vishnoh

Because of *shareera shareeri **bhaava*, this *saamaanaadhikaranya * is to be understood. Whatever is in this world, denoted by *asti * and *naasti; asti * is told as *asti * because it is eternal, does not undergo change in its essential nature. All three realities are *nitya * only. Even *prakruti * is *nitya * in its *avyakta avasthaa*. But, *prakruti * is *satata **parinaami*, keeps on undergoing change all the time. This is why it is called as *naasti*. When we have a pot, for example, when the pot is broken, it is destroyed, it becomes *kapaala*, and when that gets broken, it becomes powder. When each *avasthaa * goes to another *avasthaa*, it is *naasti, naasti, naasti*, it attains newer and newer states. Whereas *chetana * is always *jnyaana eka aakaara*, therefore it is said to be *asti shabda vaachya, svaroopa parinaama * is not there, change happens only in *svabhaava*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 12, Shloka 39:   
Jnyaana svaroopa bhagavaan yato asou ashesha moortih na tu vastu bhootah |   
Tato hi shailaabdhi dhara aadi bhedaan jaaneehi vijnyaana vijhrumbitaani ||*** *Bhagavaan * is *jnyaana svaroopa*, because He is only present in all forms. What we see as *deva, manushya, shaila*, etc. are not that. Know all these things as only the expressions of the *jnyaana*, due to the karma, with the *anusandhaana * that happens. It is not the nature of *aatman*, which is called by the *asti shabda*. Page **198** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **Here, the *srushti prakarana * which was also told earlier, is that during *pralaya*, the entire world consisting of the sentients and non-sentients, *chetana * and *achetana*, the entire thing is merged into *Bhagavaan*, united into *Bhagavaan * as one, as though there are no two entities. This is told in the *Shrutis*. During *Srushti*, what *Paramaatman * does is that those which are there during *pralaya *\(in very subtle form, without any name and form differentiation\), *Paramaatman * does *sankalpa*, and by mere willing, brings all these into their gross state, *sthoola avasthaa*, where the name and form differentiation is seen. *Sookshma chit achit vishishta **Paramaatman * becomes *sthoola chit achit vishishta Paramaatman*. In both the causal state and state of effect, these are all *visheshana * to Him; they are all like His attributes. They are all inseparably associated with Him. 



Why is it so? He is the supporter of everything, He is controller of everything, and He is also the Inner Self. Nothing can exist without Him. They are always associated with Him, whether in the subtle or gross state, this entire world consisting of sentients and non sentients is inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*. But, they are existing as *shareera * of *Paramaatman. Paramaatman's svaroopa * and *svabhaava * are told in thousands of places in the *Shrutis*, that *Paramaatman's svaroopa * is *Satyam, **Jnyaanam, Anantam*; that He is all pervading, omniscient, omnipotent, immutable. His *svabhaava * is such that He is storehouse of all auspicious qualities, without any blemish, it is told as *nirgunah, niranjanah, apahata paapmaa, vijarah, vimrutyuh, **vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, satya kaamah, satya sankalpah*. He is without any defect in any state, at any time, and is storehouse of all auspicious qualities. 



Whereas *chetana * and *achetana * have got certain defects. Achetana undergoes change all the time in its essential nature itself, so, it is said to be *naasti shabda vaachya*. Whatever was a lump of mud becomes a pot; when the pot is broken, we say that the pot is gone, and that it is only the pieces, *kapaala*; from that it becomes powder. So, *achetana * is all the time changing. *Achetanaa paraarthaa cha nityaa satata **vikriyaa. Trigunaa karmanaamshe prakrute roopam uchyate | Prakruti * which is *achetana*, undergoing change all the time, in its very essential nature itself. But it is told that it is also *nitya*. How is this possible? If it is changing all the time, how can it be said to be *nitya*, eternal? That is always remaining in one particular state, of *moola prakruti, avyakta, pradhaana*. It is existing in this state all the time, *nitya*, eternal. This undergoes changes and modifies into *mahat, ahamkaara, pancha **bhootaas * and the *bhoutika padaarthaas * we see here. All the time, it is the *shareera * of *Paramaatman*. Changes happen in the *shareera*, the *svaroopa **parinaama * of *prakruti * which is happening does not affect *Paramaatman*, as it is happening in His *shareera*, and does not affect His nature in any way. 



In the same way, *jeevaatmans * undergo contraction and expansion in their *dharma **bhoota jnyaana*, attributive knowledge. They are *avikaari * in *svaroopa*, the essential nature does not undergo any change any time. That is also *apahata paapma, vijarah, *Page **199** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) ***vimrutyuh, vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, satya kaamah, satya sankalpah*. In essential nature, he is without any defect, pure. Whereas in his attributive nature, he has contraction and expansion because of the dharma. What is this contraction and expansion; contraction means that he forgets the true reality of his nature. He forgets that he is *sheshabhoota * to *Paramaatman*, he forgets that he is pure in reality. He thinks that he is the body he has taken due to the *karma * to experience these fruits. He takes on bodies of *deva, manushya*, etc. and he thinks that he himself is *deva*. Whereas he is not. He suffers in agonies, sorrows, has happiness, etc. whereas in reality, these are all not connected to his essential nature. This is what happens to *jeevaatman*. He is always in the same way, without any change, He is eternally present like that. There is no change in his essential nature, this is why he is called as *nitya*. This is *asti shabda vaachya*. But, here also, *jeevaatmans * are having *Paramaatman * as the inner controller. They are also his *shareera*. There is change in the attributive nature of the *jeevaatman*, who is *shareera * of *Paramaatman*. This does not affect *Paramaatman * in any way. 



In His essential and attributive nature, *Paramaatman * is untouched by any of these changes. 



This is what is explained in these *shlokaas * as *asti * and *naasti*. What we see in this world - rivers, mountains, oceans - all of them have *Paramaatman * as the *aatman * or inner self. Words which denote the body also denote the inner self. In our case, we have a body, and there is an individual self inside. The name given the body addresses the individual self also; it is not merely the body. In the same way, the same name also addresses the *Paramaatman * who is Inner Self. So, everything can be said to be *Paramaatman * only. This is told here as *jnyaana svaroopah bhagavaan yatah. **Bhagavaan * is *jnyaana svaroopa*. 



*Ashesha moortih asou *- all these forms are Him only. Mountain is also *Bhagavaan * only. He is *jnyaana svaroopa*. He Himself is not the mountain; mountain is His *shareera, **prakruti * which has modified into the form of mountain, which is *shareera * to *Paramaatman*, inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*, He being the Inner Self is always there. He can also be said to be the mountain in that way. He Himself is not the mountain, but is *antaryaami * of the mountain. Because it is inseparably associated with Him all the time, He can also be called as mountain. 



It is only the outer expression of *Paramaatman's * Self that all these - *shaila, abdhi, **dharaa *- the multifarious , multitude of things we see here, they are all modifications in the body of the *Paramaatman*. This is said as *vijnyaana vijhrumbhitaani*.

shabda abhidheyam iti arthaat uktam bhavati |*** This is going to be explained, what is *astyaatmaka*, and what is *naastyaatmaka. **Kshetrajnyaas * are *jeevaatmans * with *deha*. Cf Chapter 13 of *Bhagavad **Geetha. Bhagavaan * is only present as all the *kshetrajnyaas*. The nature of *Bhagavaan * is actually *jnyaana roopa*; though He is present in all these forms, He is present as *shareeri*, and the changes happen only in the *shareera. Shareeri * is eternal, *eka roopa*, and there is no change in *Bhagavaan's svaroopa, svabhaava*. What we see as *deva, manushya*, etc., are not the nature of *Bhagavaan*. He is only present as everything. His *svaabhaavika roopa * is *jnyaana * only, it is not *deva * and *manushya*. Because it is so, that which is seen in *achit roopa *\(non sentient form\) as *deva, **manushya, shaila *\(mountains\), *dharaa *\(earth\), they are all the expressions of the *aatman* due to wrong understanding, what we see outward; inside the *vijnyaana * is *eka roopa*, unchanged. The *chetanaas * also think that 'I am only *deva*', 'I am only *manushya*', etc., they think that everything is Him, the *jnyaana eka **aakaara * is *svaabhaavika roopa*, these are all just the understanding. Because of the *karma*, the *chetana * thinks that he only is *manushya*, but he is not *manushya*, he is *jnyaana svaroopa * inside; he does not understand this because of the *karma*. The *achit vastu*, non-sentient is always getting modified, undergoes change in the *svaroopa * itself, according to the *karmaas * of the *kshetrajnyaas*, that is why it is called by the word *naasti*. The other *jnyaana svaroopa * is told as *asti shabda*. What is said as *asti-aatmaka * and *naasti-aatmaka - asti * is that which exists all the time, and *naasti * is that which is not there or destroyed - and what is the reason why they are told like that? This is told in this *shloka*. 



*Bhagavaan * is only present as all the *kshetrajnya. Kshetrajnyas * are embodied souls, *jeevaatman * having the body. *Kshetra * is the body, and *kshetrajnya * is *jeevaatman. Paramaatman * is present as Inner Self. He is only present as all. The *kshetra * is not the natural form of *Paramaatman*, as that is undergoing change all the time, and *Bhagavaan * does not undergo change like that. Because of that, these things - mountain, ocean - all are the outer expression of His *vijnyaana*, His *jnyaana * only told as His *sankalpa*. Because of His *sankalpa*, He said - *Bahusyaam prajaayeya*; and everything became gross like this. This is said to be *vijnyaana vijhrumbitaani*. 



He did *sankalpa*, that Let Me become many; and He became many. Because of this Page **201** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **reason, He is seen in all these forms. He brought this subtle state to the gross state like this. Why should He do like this? He creates all these into the gross state, He wants to give the *jeevaatmans * the experiences of the fruits of their *karma*. In order to do that, He Himself expresses in all these forms, so that *jeevaatmans* can get into all these, and can experience the results of their *karma*. And that they can also do the *anusthaana * of *upaaya*, means to emancipation, and get rid of *samsaara*. He gives them an opportunity to experience the fruits of the actions they have done, *karmaas*; and based on the *karmaas * of each individual, different experiences are there; those experiences happen in various kinds of bodies, and all these bodies are created because of that. This is told as *kalpita, kalpanaa * means *srushti*; this is also told in one *Brahma Sutra, Kalpanopadeshaat cha. Kalpanaa * is *sooryaa chandramasou dhaataa **yathaa poorvam akalpayat. Kalpanam srushtih * is explained by *Bhaashyakaarar*. 



Generally, when we translate the word *kalpita*, we say "imagined". He did *sankalpa*; they are all true. Nothing is false in our *siddhaanta*; everything is true; it is not an illusion. Why is it true? It is to give a place for experience of the *karmaas*, fruits of the *karmaas*, for the *jeevaatman. Paramaatman * Himself has to support everything, He is supporting all the time; He brings about this change in the *shareera*, and then He makes *jeevaatmans * get into the various bodies, makes them experience the results of the karma, creation is done because of that. But, by His nature, He Himself is not the mountain, He is unaffected by any of the defects of the *shareera, **chetana * or *achetana*. He remains in the same form all the time. 



The *achit vastu*, which is non-sentient, is getting modified according to the *karmaas * of the *kshetrajnya*. So, it is told as the *naasti shabda*. It does not remain the same all the time, keeps on changing. When a person dies, that person is gone, he is *naasti*. Whereas he enters another body. The body merges into the five elements, *pancha bhootaas*. And a new body is created, and is given to the *jeevaatman. Achetana * is all the time undergoing change, and does not remain in the same state always. Because of this, it is said to be *naasti shabda vaachya*. 



*Jeevaatmans * are called by *asti shabda*, because the same *jeevaatman * enters into another body. There is only contraction in his *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, but he remains constant without any change.

Yadaa tu shuddham nijaroopi sarvam karmakshaye jnyaanam apaasta dosham |   
Tadaa hi sankalpataroh phalaani bhavanti no vastushu vastu bhedaah ||*** When all the *karmaas * end, he gets rid of all the *doshaas*, defects, because of which his *dharma bhoota jnyaana * has contracted; therefore he thinks that he himself is *deva, manushya, krimi, keeta*.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **All the fruits in the tree of *sankalpa*, when they end, this kind of experience will not exist any more, is the meaning of this *shloka*. 



When he is in the body of *deva, manushya*, etc., he will act according to that, again accumulate *karma*, and fruits, good or bad, and in order to experience, he will get another body.

That is why he is addressed at many places as *jnyaana * itself, because it is the *saara bhoota guna * of *jeevaatman*. His *nija **roopa * is that only, but because of karma, it is covered because of the *avidyaa*. When he gets rid of that, which is the cause of the *anusandhaana * that 'I am different', when all the defects are completely gone, he becomes pure and his original state, the various objects of experience which are here, that will not be there anymore with the karma completely gone. In order to experience the karma only, all these are there, we think that 'We are eating food', in the real state, all these things are not there, when he attains his real state without any *karma*. Because of the *karma*, he thinks of himself as *deva, manushya*, etc., he thinks of them to be enjoyable, this is addressed by the word *naasti. Chetana * is in its original state, which is *jnyaanaika roopa, **shuddha*, denoted by the *asti shabda*. 



We are studying *Amsha * 2, Chapter 12, where *Paraasharar * is teaching very important aspects. After having taught about the *bhuvanaas*, the various worlds, *Paraasharar * is teaching a very important concept that everything is controlled by *Paramaatman*, *Sri **Mahaavishnu*, and that He is *antaryaami * of everything. He is existing as everything. All these aspects, *Paraasharar * is teaching here. 



*Jeevaatman * is also *jnyaana eka aakaara. Jeevaatman * who is also *jnyaana eka **aakaara*, being pure and untainted even in the bound state in his essential nature, but his attributive nature only changes. When he is in a body of a *deva*, he identifies himself with the *deva*, he thinks he himself is the body. But, he is not *deva*, he is actually a *jnyaana svaroopa*. He forgets this because of the contraction in attributive Page **203** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **knowledge. He identifies himself with all these *achetana padaarthaas*. Whereas he is *chetana, jnyaana avaroopi*, he forgets that. This happens because of the *karma * that he has accumulated. He has to experience the results of that *karma*. When he surrenders unto the Lord, does *bhakti yoga*, gets rid of that *karma*, all these defects vanish. At that time, he is without any defect, and goes into his natural state, *nija **roopi*. Identifying himself with the *deva * and other forms, he thinks of himself in those forms - these forms are a result of the *karmaas * of the *jeevaatmans*, and also the enjoyable things which are there - the sense objects, *bhoga arthaah*. When his *karmaas * all end, then he will not experience these forms and sense objects any more, he will never think of himself as *deva, manushya*, etc. All these things we see in this world, as most enjoyable, it will not be like that, because he will be in his true original state where his *dharma bhoota jnyaana * will be in proper original state. He will never be subjected to these limited experiences which happen here. When he was in a body like *deva * and others, when he thought of himself as the body, the objects of experience and enjoyment, which are nothing but *deva, manushya, shaila, **abdhi, dharaa*, the various objects we see here, when the *karmaas * are destroyed, these kinds of experiences will not be there any more. The *achit vastu*, which is insentient, matter, is always taking some state or the other, undergoing change, is called by the *naasti shabda. Jeevaatmans* are all the time in their essential nature, *jnyaana eka roopa*, and because of that, they are called by the *asti shabda*.

It is called *naasti * as it never exists in the same state, keeps on modifying from one state to another state. We have ice, when heated it becomes water, then it becomes steam, water is gone. This is told Page **204** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **as *naasti*. It always exists in some other state, there is no complete destruction in its essential nature, because in some state, it is eternal. That which is called as *asti, **jeevaatman*, do not have a beginning or middle or end, as they exist in the same state all the time. The essential nature of *jeevaatman * is identical for ever, all the time, it is always *eka roopa padaartha*; it is never told as *naasti*. Whereas the inert matter is never seen like that, not in the same state all the time. Because of this, what happens? That which is attaining different states all the time, which is undergoing changes, is it told at any time as *asti*? No. it is never told like that, it is always told as *naasti * only. 



Have you seen any matter, material which can be told as not having beginning or middle or end? No, we can never see like that because they are always created, destroyed, they go to different states, they keep on changing. We can never say that they are existing forever in one state, with respect to the *achetanaas*, non-sentient matter.

Leaving out the *jnyaana svaroopa aatma*, any *achetana*, material we see around here, at any point of time, and for whatever reason cannot be called by the *asti shabda*. Though he is of a nature very different from *deva * and others, the cause of taking on a body like *deva, manushya*, etc., are the various *karmaas * done himself; and the identifying with the body of *deva * and others, also happens due to the *karma * only. Always he is associated and going with those forms only, it is not because of the *aatma*, but because of the *achetana * which is *naasti shabda vaachya*. 



*Paraasharar * is telling that no *achetana*, for whatever reason, cannot be called as *asti **shabda. Jeevaatman * only is the thing which can be called as *asti shabda*. Even though *jeevaatman * is taking the form and identifying himself, it is due to the association with *prakruti * and not because of nature of *aatman*. It is not because of the nature of *aatman * because it is unchanging all the time, and all the time *jnyaana **eka aakaara*.

When someone dies, *aatman * is always existing, and takes on a different body. When body dies, it disintegrates, and various elements merge into their causes. Page **207** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **Whereas *jeevaatman * remains in the same state, constant in his essential nature. *Achit amsha * is changing every moment, is called *naasti shabda*. This kind of world having *chetanaas * and *achetanaas*, is the *shareera * of *Vaasudeva*, supported by Him, controlled by Him, and He is master of all. Always it is having *Vaasudeva * as the self. That is the reality of this world, which I have explained you in detail. I have explained you in detail, very clearly, that this is the *yaathaatmya * of the *jagat*, reality, real nature of this world, which has *chetana * and *achetana*, everything having *Vaasudeva * as the *aatman*. Everything is the *shareera * for *Vaasudeva*. 



*Yat asti, yat naasti*, whatever was told in the beginning, is being concluded here with the words *satya * and *asatya. Asatya * does not mean it is false or illusion, but that it is *naasti shabda vaachya*. Because the *upadesha * here is started with the world being *Vaasudevaatmaka*, by telling as *asti, naasti*. Whatever is started in the *upakrama*, beginning, is concluded here in the *upasamhaara * with the words *satya * and *asatya*. The *aatma-aatma saamya*, which is told in *Geetha * also, that all the *aatmans * are similar because all are *jnyaana eka aakaara*. Every *aatma * in every body is *jnyaana eka aakaara*. They are multiple individuals but are all *jnyaana eka **aakaaraas*. There is no identity, but it is similarity. There are innumerable number of *jeevaatmans*, but all are *jnyaanaikaakaaraas. Ashabda * is *prakruti*, which is *achetana*, as told in the *Brahma Sutras*. The entire thing present in this world is mixture of *chetana * and *achetana*. In the *vyavahaara*, when we do our daily activities, as *deva, manushya - karma * only is the cause for all this.

He then enjoys communion with the Lord.

One should know that whoever is here, in all these worlds - they are all ending some time or the other. If one starts associating with these, and identifying with these only, he will keep on coming into the cycle of births and deaths only. Having known all these, one should put effort to escape from *samsaara*. This is the purpose of all of this. One has to put effort to liberate from this *samsaara*. Knowing that the fruits of *karma * are all *asthira*, impermanent. *Vaasudeva * who is *sadaa achala, sadaa ekaroopa, dhruva *- whatever is to be performed in order to attain, gain communion with *Vaasudeva*, then he will attain that. He will go and attain *Paramaatman. Upaasanaa, prapatti*, etc.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **the *karmaas * are giving fruits which are impermanent, short lived and meagre; one has to put effort towards the means required in order to attain unity with *Paramaatman*, who is eternal and ultimate bliss. This is the purpose of teaching all that. 



This concludes Chapter 12. Next, he is going to talk about *Bharata * who actually did this, the means to attain *Vaasudeva*.

Now, what is the connection, transition to the story of *Bharata*, coming here? This is explained in the Commentary. In the last *shloka * of the previous chapter, it was told that "Having known that this *jeevaatman * takes on different forms and it is not in his real nature like that; because of *karma*, he becomes *deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi*, he is suffering here, thinking that he only is all that; but in reality, he is not so; knowing that, and understanding that, one has to put effort by adopting which means, he will get rid of this *karma*, and he will attain *Vaasudeva*. One has to do whatever is required to get rid of this *samsaara*", this was told in the end. The means to attain *Vaasudeva * was told there. It was told that one has to do that, the means; one has to do the *upaaya anusthaana*. That is not easy, *bhagavat upaasanaa * is difficult, and is full of obstructions, so many obstructions to attaining *Vaasudeva*. To attain that *jnyaana yoga*, the obstructions which are there in the path of attaining *Vaasudeva*, and the way one can get rid of those obstructions - the story of *Bharata*, whichever was mentioned earlier, is a good example for that. In order to listen to that in detail, *Maitreyar * is asking *Sri Paraasharar*.

Though he was a *Brahmin*, he did not recite the *Vedaas*, because he was already endowed with that complete knowledge, because of the previous *janma*. It is said that one who has perfected the yoga, the *karmaas* done earlier will lead him to attain perfection in the yoga. He had attained perfection in the *yoga*, he had perceived the self directly; *aparoksha jnyaana * is *pratyaksha jnyaana * of the *aatman*. Because of that, he was a realized soul, and was always established in the self, in the *aatma jnyaana*; for such a person who is a *yogaaroodha*, it is alright if he does not do *yajnya * and other such *karmaas*. By this it does not mean that one who has simply known the *vaakyaartha jnyaana*, who just has studied the *Vedaas * and knows the meanings of the *mantraas * without having the *aatma jnyaana * and having not realized the meanings - such a person is not supposed to leave the *karma*. Because, in order to attain perfection in *yoga*, one has to get *jnyaana * and *karma *- both are required. *Karma **anushtaana * is also required for *shuddhi * of the mind. When he attains perfection, at that time, he would have realized the self. A person who has only *vaakyaartha **jnyaana * cannot give up *karmaas*.

We saw the story of the *antaraaya * with the *mruga*, how he had to be born as a deer, how he expended all that *karma * responsible for that *janma*, and again was born in a *yogi's kula*, and is again established in *aatma jnyaana*. 



We are studying *Amsha* 2, Chapter 13, the *Jadabharata upaakhyaana*; about how *Jadabharata*, was born in a great *yogi's * family, as a *brahmin*, had *poorva janma **smaranaa*, and was endowed with complete knowledge, a person who had perfected the yoga already, and knew that because of the *praarabdha karma*, he had to continue and do all the things that are coming. As a *yogi*, he was so much involved in his *yoga*, following the *Hiranyagarbha vachana*. He used to fear any honour, because that will bring some kind of ego, and will disturb the yoga. When a *yogi * is dishonoured and disrespected by people, then this *yogi * attains perfection soon. He used to live as though he was *jada*, *unmatta*, etc. as if he is a dullard, not knowing anything, and absolutely useless kind of feeling. He used to wear all dirty clothes, and was never bothered about any of these things. Whatever little people used to give, leftovers, he used to think that itself as a lot, and used to be very happy, contented with whatever he used to get to carry his body. He used to be happy with whatever was given, even old and spoilt stuff. 



He was fat and well built. Looking at him, people all around used him for all kinds of work.

Because if he had seen the proper form, that "I am not the body", then he cannot say all these things, because it cannot be said like that. When the *visheshya * is not seen, how can you tell about the *visheshana*? When the qualified object, *aatman * cannot be seen, how can the qualities of the *aatman * be told?

Because of the *gunaas*, they are engaged in all these activities. It is the effect of the *gunaas*, which is like a stream which is flowing, and this body is being carried in that flowing stream. Just as a blade of grass is being carried by air, water, etc. Just like a weak person is being dragged here and there by horses which are uncontrollable, wild horses, so also, all the collectivity of the *pancha bhootaas*, till the *antahkarana*, the inner sense organ the mind, and all the qualities, *sattva, rajas, tamas * of the *prakruti*, come in the form of walking, sitting, desire, hatred, and all these forms.

Dehaanaam sanghaatatvaat pratyekam anekatvam |*** It was said that it is because of *prakruti, gunaas, karmaas * which are accumulated due to *avidyaa*. So, the *aatman * does not have all these. By these, we can know that *aatman * cannot be seen, that he is not carrying, etc. He also does not have the characteristics of being fat, etc. *Aatman * is untouched by the blood and all things, impurities in the body. He is indestructible. He is free from *ashanaaya, pipaasa, **jaraa, mrutyu, dukha, sukha *- these are the *oormi shatka *- hunger, thirst \(characteristics of the *praana*\), old age, death \(characteristics of the *deha*\), happiness and sorrow \(characteristics of the mind\); this *oormi shatka * is not there for the *aatman*. The *prakruti gunaas sattva, rajas, tamas * are not there for the *aatman*. He is different and distinct from *prakruti*. He does not have the *dharmaas * of *prakruti*. Therefore, either growth or deterioration are not there for the *aatman*. Body grows and shrinks in old age - these are all not there for *aatman*. One more reason is that he is *eka*; the meaning is not that there is only one *aatman * in all of us, but that he is not a collectivity, he is niravayavi. Body is collectivity of five elements, which has *indriyaas*, which are *ahamkaarika*, but all are *prakruti parinaama * only. Body is *sanghaata*, collectivity. Whereas *aatman * is *eka, niravayavi*. Because it is a collectivity, *deha * and other things grow and shrink. That which is not a collectivity, like the sky, or *paramaanu*, it does not have growth and shrinkage. Just as you and I are not the body, all the embodied souls are like that, the *aatman * which is present in all the embodied souls, is similar to the *aatman * who is in you and in me. Whatever I said, you can see in all the beings. He is *jnyaana svaroopa * in all the bodies. In all beings, *aatma amsha * is only one, is also another meaning of *ekasya akhila jantushu*; there is one *aatman * in every being. Because *deha * is *sanghaata*, collectivity, there is multiplicity like that. Each body is multiple, because five elements are there, whereas *aatman * is one only in every body.

Thus *Bharata * said - I am not carrying you. You are not being carried. I am not carrying this weight. all of these are only bodies, bodies are only carrying. After telling these, he said that *aatman * is different from the body, the *aatma dharmaas * are different, it is all because of *prakruti*, the *karma, avidyaa*, it is because of these that we are thinking like this.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **Then *Bharata * replies again, and tells what is it you are telling - *tvam, aham*, etc. He does the *aatma upadesha*, which we will see next. 



We are studying *Amsha * 2, Chapter 13, where *Mahaayogi Bharata*, who is not revealing his nature that he is a great *yogi*, is showing himself as a dullard, or useless person, is made to carry the palanquin of the king *Souveera*. And as he is going in an uneven way, the king asks the carriers to carry them properly, then *Jadabharata * starts to give strange answers, when everyone points at him. The king asks him - You are so stout, well built, why re you not carrying properly, are you tired. He starts to give strange answers and the king does not expect such answers from someone who looks like a labourer, who has been brought to carry his palanquin. He tells that the king does not have *aatma jnyaana*, that the self is different and distinct from the body; the king starts to still argue with him that he is fat; *Bharata * explains to him that these are all *prakruti * only, the *aatman * is different and distinct from the body, and that the *aatman* is not carrying anything. He says that if I have to carry this weight, if I am carrying this weight, I should carry the weight of the *pruthvi * also, all the mountains, and everyone should be doing that including you. Whatever is the material from which your palanquin is made, from the same material the body is also made, and keeps quiet. Immediately, the king recognizes that he is no ordinary person, that he is a great yogi, then jumps from his palanquin and holds his feet firmly, and requests him to tell him who he is, and teach him that *aatma jnyaana*. Then *Bharata * starts to teach.

So, you cannot ask as to "Who are you", and I Page **234** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **cannot also say that "I am so and so". If he said that "For what reason are you here", the answer is to experience the fruits of the *karma*. The *chetana * is moving around with a body everywhere, in order to experience the fruits of the *karmaas*, that he has accumulated.

Sukha dukha upabogou you tou deha aadi upapaadakou |   
Dharma adharma udbhavou bhoktum jantuh dehaadim rucchati ||*** *Sukha * and *dukha * are coming from *dharma * and *adharma*, following the *shaastra * and not following the *shaastra*. When we transgress the *shaastraas*, we will be punished, and this leads to *dukha*. When one is following the *shaastraas*, he will be rewarded, and will enjoy some *sukha*. In order to experience all these things, the good and bad of the virtues and sins, he takes different bodies, and they are the cause for all these things. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

Whatever *karmaas * we do, the fruits will be according to those, and will in a particular place, time and body. For each *karma * for each person, it is well established, that that person has to experience the fruits for this *karma*, with this body, at this time, and in this place. In order to experience those fruits, he keeps moving around, in different places. To experience the results of those *karmaas*, he takes different bodies, and moves around in different places. 



This is the answer to the question of the king - "Why have you come". He says that this is to experience this *karma*. For everyone, it is like this.

Aham shabda * is not a waste. *Aham * is told with respect to the *aatman * only. *Aham artha * is not without any attributes, to say that I cannot say *aham*. Because many attributes are told with respect to *aatman, **aatman * is *shuddha*, etc. So, if I say *sah aham*, there is nothing wrong in this, it is reasonable. In the same way, if I ask who are you, for that question also, there is nothing wrong in that, it is also quite reasonable. With respect to that which is not an *aatman*, if I say *aham*, then it is wrong. But, with respect to *aatman*, I should be able to address it as *aham*; what is wrong in that, is the *abhipraaya*.

Even though we can say *aham * with respect to this *aatman*, "This is I", and "Who are you" - these kind of questions cannot be asked, is the *bhaava*. He does not have *jaati*, class and other *dharmaas*, attributes. We cannot say that "I am a *Brahmin*, a *Kshatriya*, a king, etc", though one may have the attributes of *avikaari, shuddha*, etc., this kind of *jaati * and other *dharmaas * which are of the *deha*, cannot be told to be *aatman*. This is the *abhipraaya * of this *shloka*.

All these are not I, these are all mere instruments of producing the sound, speech. They are all not I.

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **is that thinking that the body itself is the *aatman*, this is the major reason why king is asking these questions, it is told that it is not true, in these three *shlokaas*. The tongue and others are saying I, do you think like that, that is not true. These are all not I, because they are many - there is tongue, lips, teeth, palate. *Aham * is not like that. *Aham * is only known as one. *Ekatva * is known. Because the tongue and others are just the causes of producing the speech, that is why they are not the doers. The doer is *aatman * only. From this, "I am touching this", "I am remembering this", with respect to the external and internal sense organs which are there, thinking that they are the *aatman*, is rejected from this.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 13, Shloka 88:   
Kim hetubhih vadati eshaa vaak eva aham iti svayam |

The organ of speech itself, along with the instruments of tongue and others, is telling " *Aham*". In this case, the *vaak indriya * will itself become the *aatma*. This is also not true. Because it is also an instrument, and is not independent. Assuming that the *vaak indriya * is itself the *aatma*, it cannot say that "You are fat", because the *aatma * is not fat. If *vaak **indriya * is itself *aatman*, then also it would not have told that you are fat, because that is not the *dharma * of the *aatman*. And we use in our regular transactions that "My speech" - this also shows that speech is different from I. There is on *Vyaakarana **paksha*, grammarians, which says that *shabda * itself is the *artha*, with the tongue and other instruments, the organ of speech is itself telling *aham*, they explain that *ghata **shabda * is itself the *ghata*. That is also not correct. By this, *sparsha, roopa, buddhi, **sukha, icchaa *- all these do not have any doership. None of them have the *kartrutva * is made clear here.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **The person's body is different. It is made of head, hands, etc. Because the body which is different from the individual self, who is inside, and body has head, hands, etc., where will I say that "this is I", Will I say "Hand is I", or "Head is I"? It has all these things in the body, and these are different from the individual self, where can I say that I am this.

| ***In the same way, the body which is made up of head, *paayu, paani*, etc., is a collection of all these, and is the support of tongue and others. That body is also not the individual self. When one is awake, we say that "This is my body", I am different from the body, as clearly experienced. In the dream state and deep sleep state, even though *aatman * is present and is self-vivid, *svayam prakaasha*, and *deha * is different, the body is experienced as differently, or it is not experienced at all. In dream state, we experience different things, and in deep sleep, nothing is experienced, but the *aatman * is still there. This also shows that body is different from *aatman. **Shruti * says " *Svarga kaamo yajeta*", meaning that one who wants to go and experience in *svarga*, he has to perform this *yaaga*. If *aatman * is not different from the body, the body is destroyed when one dies, and svarga and other fruits are experienced after death only, in some other birth. If the *aatman * is not different from the body, then all these things will become meaningless. It is very clear in the *shrutis * that *aatman * is different and distinct from the body. Or, the body made of head, hands, etc., has got many parts, *avayavaas, aham artha * is only one. It can also be explained in this way. *Deha, indriya*, are all not the *aatman*, with which part shall I say " *aham*", "this is I". That is why I am not able to say.

That is why I cannot say that he, and I, because all are of the same nature, *aatma-aatma saamya*. If another *aatman * is of a different nature from me, I could have said that.

In this case also, questions like "Who are you", "I am this", are of no use because we are all *prakaaraas * of *Paramaatman * only.

This is told by these two *shlokaas*. According to our *siddhaanta, aatma-bahutva * is accepted, that every body has a different *aatman*. Every body has an *aatman*, but all are of the same nature - all are *jnyaana-eka-aakaaraa*, and all are *prakaara * of *Paramaatman*. In this way, all are similar, equal, and it is not identity. The individual selves are many, there is not one individual self. Why we can understand like this? If there is one who is different from me, it is accepted that there is one in another body also. If the *aatman * in another body is different from me, then only we can say that "He is he", and "I am I". We know that, and it is accepted that there is an *aatman* in another body also, but he is not different from me, in the sense that we are of the same nature. *Vyakti aikya * is not told. Accepting that there is another *aatman * who is other than me, he is not different; the meaning is that he is of the same nature. If it had been only one *aatman*, words like *anyah, parah * would not have been used here. I cannot say that "He is *anya*", because the other person is also *jnyaana-eka-**aakaara * only. That he is different is negated here. ***

If any other *aatman * would have been different from me, who is of a different nature than *jnyaana-eka-aakaara * of mine, pure consciousness, in that case, I would have told that I am *jnyaana-eka-aakaara*, and he is of a different nature. It is not true like this. This is the *aatma-aatma-**samatva * which is told in *Bhagavad Gita * also, that all are *jnyaana eka aakaaraas*, they are all equal. The difference which we see in *jaati, kula*, etc, is not the *dharma * of the *aatman *- these are not the attributes of the individual self, who is only of the nature of consciousness. All are *prakaara*, modes of *Paramaatman*, so that we can say that all are equal, one. All are *prakaara * of *Paramaatman*. For everyone, *Paramaatman * only is the inner self. He is the *prakaari, antaryaami*. There is only one *Prakaari*, but all are modes of *Paramaatman*. All are *prakaara * of *Paramaatman*, so all are one. All are *prakaara * of *Paramaatman*, can be told in the primary meaning itself. There is a *prayoga * called *samaana-dharma **asamaana-dharma aneka-dharma*; that they are all of the same attributes, they are of different attributes, and same attributes and many attributes; all are of the same attributes, all are of different attributes, in this kind of meaning, if it is to be conveyed, all are of same attributes, all are of many attributes, is also used. *Eko **vreehih * is a common usage. When we see a heap of rice, we say In all houses, it is the same rice which is used. Means that *vyakti aikya * is not there. Rice is same means that they also eat rice and we also eat rice, but it is not the same rice eaten at both places.

In the first *shloka * above \( *Shloka * 90\), *aatmans * are different in each body, but they are all of the same nature, they are not of different nature. So, the fact of the *aatmans * being of different nature is negated here, but not the multiplicity of *aatmans*.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **that. *Upanishad * says - *ekah, nityah, chetanah, nityaanaam, bahoonaam, **chetanaanaam *- one *Paramaatman * who is eternal, of the nature of consciousness, he grants the desires of many eternal *aatmans*. If you accept that there is only one *aatman*, it will be totally against this *shruti*. It is also said " *Aham tvam cha tathaa **anye cha*" \( *Shloka * 69 above\) - so it is not one *aatman*, but it is one *aatman * in each body, of the same nature and they are all being the *prakaara * of *Paramaatman*, all *jnyaana-eka-aakaara*. And also of the same nature, the *Bhagavad Gita shloka * is told. The *aatmans*, individual selves, the *vaishamya * is not there, they are of the same nature. Therefore, the question asked by the king and the replies given by *Bharata * are proper, as can be understood from this.

From now, what is told is that they are all *anitya * and *aatman * is *nitya*. In the remaining part of this chapter, this is being taught. Palanquin is being told here, because whatever is the material of the palanquin, it is *anitya * and *anaatma * also. It is not *nitya*, it is *anitya*. These are all not eternal.

That which does not get a different name, at any point of time is *vastu*. The *anya **samjnyaa * comes because of *parinaama*. The *achetana * goes on continuously changing in its *svaroopa * itself, and because of that, it keeps on getting different names. The previous state is destroyed and a new state is created. For *achetana*, there is *parinaama * in the *svaroopa * itself. Whatever is *vastu * is only that which does not get a different name or form, at any point of time. It is of the same form at any point of time; there is no change in its *svaroopa*. It is all not what is seen here; these are all *avastu*.

In the state of *avyakta*, the *moola prakruti*, it is also eternal. But, it undergoes changes, that is why it is called as *asat*, or *avastu*, because it does not remain in the same state all the time. 



We are at the end of *Amsha * 2, Chapter 13, where *Bharata * is teaching the *aatma **svaroopa*, to King *Souveera*, that the *aatma svaroopa * is different from *deha, **indriyaas*, and we need to study the last few *shlokaas*. *** ***With respect to the *achit, achetana*, what is meant is *avastu * and *asat; tuccha * means Page **245** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **it gets destroyed, it does not exist; *mitthya * means that it is imagined, it is only appearance; it is not like this, because though there is change in the essential nature, there is no complete destruction. 



In one of the earlier *shlokaas*, it was told that whatever is mud, it became pot; that mud is destroyed and pot is created. Then pot is destroyed and *kapaala * is created. Then *kapaala * is destroyed and *choorna*, powder is created. Then the powder is destroyed, and it becomes dust. Then, it is destroyed and it becomes *anu*, which is not seen. But, in all these, the *svaroopa naasha * is not there. It is only there in some other state. The previous state gets destroyed, and the next state is created, *avasthaantaraapatti*. There is no complete destruction of the *svaroopa*. 



So *avastu * or *asat * does not mean *tucchatva * or *mitthyaatva*. 



The *avastu *- state gets destroyed, and it gets into new state. Due to a different time, because of the *parinaama * or *upaadhi*, like *karma*, different form comes. That which does not get that, what is that - it is not whatever you are seeing here. How can we know that it is not *tucchatva * or *mitthyaatva*; the word *kaalaantarena * indicates that as time passes, whatever does not change is told with respect to the *vastu*, which is *aatman*. This means that the *avastu * changes over time. This indicates that it is not *mithyaa*. 



If it is in the same place, and same time, then *vidhi * and *nishedha * both cannot happen. So, it can happen at different times, and different places, it is possible. *Desha, kaala aikya * is not there. What was mud in the morning, it becomes pot in the afternoon. Mud is destroyed and pot is there. So, destruction and creation, does not happen at the same time and place, but there is time difference, there could be place difference, etc. If there is *desha kaala aikya*, then *virodha * can happen, but it is not so here. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 13, Shloka 101:   
Tvam raajaa sarva lokasya pituh putro ripoh ripuh |

Should I say that you are father, or you are son, or husband, what should I say?

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **and he becomes father with respect to his son, etc. *Raajatva * and all these are coming because of all this. He rules over people, and is called as king. These are all caused by *upaadhi*, and are not permanent.

The gist of this *prakarana * is *deha aatma viveka*, differences and specific distinctions between body and *aatman*, is being concluded here. In darkness, and when someone is closing their eyes, as *aatman * is *niravayavi*; meaning that when we close the eyes, *aatma's * eyes are not closed, as *aatman * does not have eyes, hands, etc.; so it is *niravayavi. Pratyaktva * is *svasmai bhaasamaanatvam*; it always reveals itself as *aham aham*. 



There is a wonderful portion in *Bruhadaaranyaka Upanishad * called *Jyoti Braahmana*. There, these things are explained in detail. It is asked - how is the *aatman * known when the *Aaditya*, Sun is not there? It is answered that - is it *Chandramaa*, is it *Agni*? Finally when it is complete darkness, what is it that gives light to the *Purusha*? This is called as *Jyotirbraahmana*. First, it says *Aaditya; Aaditya * is the one which gives light to the *jeevaatman*. When Sun is not there, there is the Moon. When the Moon is also not there, how does the *jeevaatman * know; it is through Agni. When Agni is not there, extinguished, what is the light. Finally it comes to when it is full darkness, it is *vaak*, speech. When there is complete darkness, we can know by speaking. When *vaak * is also not there, it is *svayam jyotih, aatma jyoti*. He knows himself, does not need any external light, or anything else. This is *svasmai bhaasamaanatva*. He is always known as *aham. Aatman * is *aham*, everything else is *idam*. When we point to some object, we say *idam*. When we say ourselves, we say *aham*. This is different from I. Whatever other parts of the body are there, head and others, they are not *aatman*; they are told as *idam*. They are also not parts of the *aatman. Aatman * is a *niravayavi*.

From that which is only revealed to others, but does not know itself, the *aatman * who knows itself is different, by *aham buddhi*, known as *aham aham*. Whereas things which are revealed to others are known as *idam*, they don't know themselves. This is the difference.

This is concluded here. The reality, nature of the *aatman * is like this. We can separate hands and feet, or also as *deva, manushya *- we see this kind of separation and differences. This is the *bheda*. These are all characteristics of the body, and not the *aatman*; they are all *anaatma dharmaas*. From other *aatmans * also, whatever can be separated - I cannot say that I am that. I cannot say that I am like all others, because one is *deva*, one is *manushya*, one is someone else, etc. Whatever forms we are seeing outside, with all the parts of the body, the *jaati*, etc. we cannot say that I am all that. 



This concludes Chapter 13.

When the pot got destroyed, *kapaala * comes. *Kapaala * is also *mrunmaya*, but the previous state is destroyed. It is *vinaashi * because it is created from a *vinaashi dravya * only. It is not *avinaashi*, as it undergoes changes in its essential nature itself. Similarly, *yajnya * is also like that. *Yajnya * is performed with *samit, darbhaa*, and ghee and other *aajyaas*. All those are *vinaashi dravyaas*, which get destroyed, and keep undergoing changes, in their essential nature itself. *Yajnya * which is an outcome of using all these things is also not permanent. Once the *yajnya * is completed, it is also over. The set of acts, the *yajnya*, which is performed with all these ingredients, that also has to get destroyed sometime; it will get ended sometime, and there will be no *yajnya * afterwards; so it is also temporary only.

Saadhanaa * itself cannot be *paramaartha*. Means itself cannot become the *saadhana*, because it is the means to attain *moksha*.

*Dhana, putra, raajya, karma * obtained from *rig-yajus-saama*, and also *karmaas * done using the *naashi dravyaas*, are all not permanent. Only *avinaashi * is *paramaartha. **Paramaartha * is not *anyaartha*, it is *ananyaartha. Aparamaartha * is all *anyaartha. **Phala abhisamhita rahita karma * is also not *paramaartha*, because *saadhanaa * is not *paramaartha*.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) ***Dhyaana * is told, and couple of more things will be told. Then it will be told as to what is *paramaartha*, in the next few *shlokaas*. 



We are at the end of *Amsha * 2, Chapter 14, where the *Mahaa yogi Bharata * is teaching *Souveera Raaja*, what is *aatma jnyaana * and what is *paramaartha*. He shows how money and other things are not *paramaartha*, because they get spent, and how the kingdom and other things are also not *paramaartha*. They are all not permanent. Also the *yajnya karma * is also not *paramaartha*, because *yajnya karma * is performed with materials which themselves get destroyed - they are all *naashi dravyas*, like *samit, kusha*, etc. Something obtained from *naashi dravyaas * cannot be permanent - so it is also not *paramaartha*. If *karmaas * are done without desire in fruits, *phala anabhisamhita karma*, that is also not *paramaartha * because that is *paramparayaa saadhana * to *moksha*. That which is *saadhana * is not *paramaartha*.

- smruti pratyayatvena kshana bhanguratvaat | Na tu paramaartho bhangurah |*** *Aatma dhyaana * is not the *parama prayojana bhoota vastu*. It differentiates from *ghata * and other things - the *aatma dhyaana*, and that is one reason why it is not *paramaartha*. It creates different kinds of experiences, like vivid, more vivid, most vivid, like this - there are *avasthaa bhedaas*, which are not there in the *paramaartha. Paramaartha * cannot have these kinds of differences in experience. There is one more explanation given - *dhyaana * is nothing but *anusmruti, **smruti * after *smruti*, continuous remembrance of the object of meditation; every instant it is a separate remembrance; so instant after instant, without any break in between and without any other thought coming in between, one has to meditate upon the object of meditation. Because it has to be meditated upon every instant, it stays for one *kshana*, and then another *kshana - paramaartha * cannot be like that. 





The next one is a very important *shloka*, which is quoted in many places. *

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 14, Shloka 27:   
Paramaatmaatmaatmano yogah paramaartha iti eeshyate |   
Mithyaa etat anyat dravyam hi na eti tat dravyataam yatah ||*** *Yoga * means *sambandha*, in this case, it means *aikya*, because the second part of the *shloka * says *mithyaa etat*. What is false, *mithya * is the *paramaatma-aatma aikya*, identity. If you like to think that *aikya * of *paramaatma * and *aatma * is *aikya*, then that is not true, it is false, because such a thing cannot happen at all. Because Page **258** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **one *dravya * cannot become another *dravya*. 



This is also told by *Sri Nammaalvaar * in *Tiruvaimoli, Koodaamaiyai koodinaalum **aduvum aduve iduvum iduve*; even if *Paramaatman * and *jeevaatman * go and merge, *Paramaatman * remains *Paramaatman * only, and *jeevaatman * remains *jeevaatman * only. There is so much difference and distinction between them that one cannot become the other. The second reason is that there is no *svaroopa naasha * in any of these. *Kaarya * is *avasthaantaraapatti*, even *kaarya * merges into *kaarana*. For *achetana*, there is *svaroopa vikaara*, but there is no *svaroopa naasha*. For *chetanaas*, there is no *vikaara * in *svaroopa * also. So, *Paramaatman * and *jeevaatman * cannot become united where *jeevaatman * loses its *svaroopa * itself. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Paramaatma iti | Ishyate yadi iti sheshah | Yogah taadaatymyam, anyathaa   
uttara ardheh na asangate | Etat aikyam mithyaa; tatra hetuh anyat iti |   
Poorveshu dhana aadishu nashvaratva aadi; yoge tu svaroopa abhaavah |*** *Yoga * is oneness or identity, which is used by other systems of philosophy, as *aikya*. The *taadaatymya * what we say is oneness, *ekee bhaava*, it is not *svaroopa aikya*, but *ekee bhaava*. This is told even in *pralaya*. Otherwise, it will not be proper with the second part of this *shloka*, which says *mithyaa etat. Aikya * is *mithyaa*. The earlier things which were told - *dhana, yajnya karma*, etc. are all *nashvara*, impermanent; they don't remain forever and get destroyed. Whereas here, in *aatma paramaatma **yoga*, what is meant is that if it means *aikya*, then that would be *svaroopa **naasha * itself. That cannot be *paramaartha*, and it is not true at all, because it is *mithyaa*.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Paramaartham aah - eka iti | Ekah - dehavat na anekah upachaya roopah |*** *Eka * means not like *deha. Deha * undergoes *baalya avasthaa, youvana avasthaa, jaraa*, etc., it keeps on changing, there is growth, there is deterioration; whereas *paramaartha*, which is *jeevaatman * is not like that; it is *eka*, remains the same all the time.

He is *nirguna*, means he does not have the qualities of *prakruti*, which are *sattva, rajas, tamas*; he is superior to *prakruti*; and he also does not have *asti, jaayate, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati *- the six *bhaava vikaaraas*, he does not have all these *bhaava vikaaraas * of *prakruti. Shat **bhaava * means different kinds of characteristics. 



He is bereft of *janma, vruddhi, parinaama, apakshaya, naasha*, which are all for the body only; it is not there for the *jeevaatman*. 



***Aatmaa - chetanah |*** *Aatma* means that it is *chetana*, which is *jnyaana aashrayatva*, he is *aashraya * to *jnyaana*. 



***Sarva gatah - naashakaanaam agni jala aadeenaam soukshmyena vyaapakah |*** *Sarva gata* means that even *agni, jala*, etc, which are all *sookshma*, they destroy other things by entering inside, being *sookshma*, but he is more *sookshma * than that; he can pervade even them.

A flute has many holes, and when the wind is blown, the air goes through each one, and when different holes are covered, different sounds are produced, like *Sa Ri Ga Ma ..., **Shadja, Daivata, Madhyama, Panchama*, etc., with different combinations of the holes. But the same air passes through all of them. When it passes through different holes, it takes different *svaraas*. This way, they are all different, and the air particles which go through each one are also different. They are all independent, but are all air only. They are identified as *shadja*, etc. when they pass through these holes. But by nature, everything is air only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Aatmano hi svaroopena parasparam bhinnaah, na tu deva aadi roopena, teshaam   
atadroopatvasya uktatvaat | ***This is the background which we have to understand before we read this *shloka. **Jeevaatmans * are many, and are different in *svaroopa*. There is a *jeevaatman * in one body, and is another *jeevaatman * in another body. They are not different because of the form of the appearance, *deva, manushya*, etc., but they are *jnyaana aakaaraas*. 



***Kechit atra aatmanaam svaroopena bhedo nishidyata iti aahuh; tat ayuktam | \*

bahuvachana virodhaat, shruti smruti sootra nyaaya virodhaat cha |*** Some say that there is no *bheda * in *svaroopa * also, meaning that there is only one single *aatma * in all the bodies, that there are not multiple *aatmaas *- that is not true. It is told in *Shrutis * that *Nityo nityaanaam chetanah chetanaanaam eko bahoonaam yo **vidhadhaati kaamaan*, this shows multiplicity of *aatmans*. This is told in the *shlokaas * here itself - You are there in that body, and I am here; Myself, you and others also; meaning that each individual self exists separately, is different; there are many individual selves, but all are of the same nature. If we say that *aatman * is only one, in all the bodies, and that there are not multiple *aatmans*, if the *aatma **bahutva * is not told, it is opposed to what was taught here itself in so many *shlokaas*, which are telling about *aatma bahutva*. It is also against *Shruti, Smruti, Nyaaya*, etc. Page **262** of **297

***Yadi deva aadi roopena aatmanaam na bhedah, katham tarhi devo ayam,   
manushyo ayam iti vaishamyena vyavahaara upapadyate? Tatra aaha - venu   
randhra iti |*** If there is no difference, *bheda * in the form of *deva, manushya*, etc. how can we even say that this is *deva*, this is *namushya*, etc.? Then everyone should be addressed in the same way. How can we address different individuals differently? This is answered in this *shloka*. 



***Yathaa venoh aneka randhra vartinaam vaayu amshaanaam vaayutvena eka

In the same way, the *aatmaas*, are of the same nature of *jnyaana*, consciousness, enter into the body of *deva, manushya*, etc., and one is called *deva*, another is called *manushya*, etc. The *aatman * itself does not become of the form of the body. The *aatman * itself does not change the *svaroopa*, it is *eka svaroopa*. 



***Abheda vyaapinah abhedena vaayutva aakaarena vyaapinah |*** Without any difference, in the same form as *vaayu*, it is pervading everywhere. 



***Atra paramaatma shabdena aatmaa eva uchyate, \* Paramaatmaa iti cha api ukto   
dehe asmin purushah parah; \* Taih eva vigatah shuddhah paramaatmaa   
nigadyate, ityaadi darshanaat |*** The word *Paramaatman * is used here. The meaning of *Paramaatman * is *aatman * only here. Because of the context, and it is *aatma jnyaana * which is being taught. An example is given about how the *jeevaatman * existing in this body is told as *Paramaatman*. Another reference where *jeevaatman * is told by the name *Paramaatman * is given.

**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **difference as *deva, manushya*, etc., is meant here. The differences of the form of *deva, manushya*, etc., of the *jeevaatmans*, who are of the same nature, *jnyaana **aakaara*, is because of the karma, as told here. Though he is existing in his body and other bodies, he is of the same nature everywhere. He is fully made of consciousness. Because he is covered by the *karma*, external *karma*, his nature is covered. So, he is not realizing his nature. *Prajah * means *prakarshena jaayate*. The *baahya karma * is covering it. 



***Phala abhisandhi yuktam bhagavati asamarpitam cha baahya karma, aatmanah   
svaroopa bahirbhootam vaa, yathaa vakshyati \* Avidyaa karma sanjnyaa anyaa   
... tayaa tirohitatvaat cha shaktih kshetra samjnyitaa | Sarva bhooteshu   
bhoopaala taaratamyena vartate || iti |*** *Baahya karma* is that *karma * done with desire in the fruits, and that which is not surrendered into *Paramaatman*. One wants to enjoy oneself. He thinks that he is only the enjoyer of the fruits, that he is only doing the *karma*, and he has desire in the fruits. When one does such a *karma*, it is called *baahya karma*. It is outside *aatman's **svaroopa. Aatma svaroopa * is not like that. *Aatma svaroopa * is *bhagavat sheshabhoota*, that he cannot independently do anything; by nature, he is utterly subservient to *Paramaatman*, and he has to do all kinds of service to *Paramaatman * at every stage; this is his very nature. Whereas if one thinks that he is doing the various *karmaas*, does with a desire in fruits, thinking of himself as the enjoyer, this is *baahya karma*. In reality, the *pradhaana phali * is *Paramaatman * only for all the *karmaas*. Because of that wrong understanding and performing *karmaas * in that manner, this difference of *deva, manushya*, is coming. *Aatmaas * are all of the same nature, *jnyaana aakaaraas. Karma * is making them to get these kind of bodies, and experience the fruits. *Sri Engal Aalwaan * gives *pramaanaas*, which will come later. 



*Avidyaa * is also called *karma. Chetana * and *achetanaas * are the *shaktis * of *Paramaatman*, and *avidyaa * is also one *shakti*, called *karma*. Because he is covered by that, by which the *shakti * called *kshetrajnya * is covered by the *shakti * called *avidyaa*, called *karma*; in all the beings, there is a *pramaana * which says that *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes *sankocha vikaasa*. In our *siddhaanta*, it is well established that *dharma bhoota jnyaana * undergoes *sankocha vikaasa; **samsaara * comes because it has become *sankuchita*. For this, there is a *pramaana * in *Vishnu Puraana*, which will come. In all beings, there are differences, various degrees. For those who have not much *sankocha*, they will be in *punya **janmaas*. For those who have very much contracted *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, they will be born as *pashus, pakshis, keeta, vruksha*, etc. This is the difference for the bodies they take. 



***Deva aadi bhedah cha ayam yugapat anekeshaam ekasya cha kaala bhedena   
apadhvaste aavarane - karma aavarane, sa deva aadi bhedo na bhavati | ***These differences seen in the bodies of *deva, manushya*, etc. - for many of them, when it gets destroyed, over a period of time, the *karma * which is covering, that *aavarana * will not be there any more. That cover will not be there. It can be a difference in time, or it can be the same time for many of them. *Moksha * has got a Page **264** of **297

***Deva aadi bheda apadhvasta it cha paathah | Yathaa aaha shounakah \*   
Karminaam karmabhedena deva bhedaadayo yatah || Karmakshayaat   
asheshaanaam bhedaanaam samkshayah tatah || iti | ***Because of the difference in *karma*, various *karmaas * that the individual does, they take various births. When the *karmaas * get destroyed, all the differences will go. In their *svaroopa*, they will be *jnyaana eka aakaara*. And all the individual selves for whom the *karma * gets destroyed, they will get liberated. 



This is the nature of *jeevaatman * taught in all these *shlokaas*.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 15, Shloka 1:   
Sri Paraasharah -   
Ityukte mouninam bhooyah chintayaanam maheepatim |   
Prati uvaacha atha vipro asou advaita antargataam kathaam ||*** *Sri Paraasharar *- When he was taught all these things by *Mahaayogi Bharata*, the King *Souveera Mahaaraaja * started to think about the *aatma svaroopa*, the *paramaartha * which was told, what was not *paramaartha*, etc., he went into deep thinking. And again, he told *Bharata*. There is a story which is also teaching a similar thing, where *aatma svaroopa * is being taught. That story he started to recite. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Ityukta iti | Iti ukte - evam aatmano vaishamya abhaava ukte | Kshut pipaasa

vaachaa achodayantam maheepatim abhipraayajnyo viprah chitvastu vaishamya   
abhaava vishayaam kathaam uvaacha |*** In this way, it was told that the *aatmans * are all of the same nature; that the essential nature of all *aatmans * is the same. When he was still thinking, still not very clear; that the body appearance is one thing - the *deva, manushya*, etc., but how about hunger, thirst, etc. he started to think about them. Is hunger, thirst real, not real, is it in *aatma svaroopa*, or not, is it due to karma, etc., he started to think. The difference can still exist because things like thirst, hunger, are different for different people. It is something other than the form of the body which is seen. The king was silent thinking about this. The *Braahmana * knew what the king was thinking. He then started to tell him a story about this, to clear those doubts. That there is no difference in the *chit vastu*, all are *jnyaana eka aakaaraas * only. With respect to this, he started to tell one more story. In which thirst, hunger are all addressed.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 15, Shloka 2:

In order to enlighten him with proper knowledge, *Rubhu * taught him. I will tell you that.

So, this is only *upachaara*, just told like that. It is because of the *dhaatus * in the *deha * that this happens, though it is a quality of the mind. It is an *icchaa * of the mind. *Icchaa, **dvesha * happen to the mind. The *Shruti * says that hunger and thirst are for *praana*, and grief and *moha* belong to the mind. The *shruti vaakya * says that hunger and thirst are not for *deha*, but for *praana. Jaraa * and *mrutyu * are *deha dharmaas*. So, this is basically a *kriyaa shakti * of manas only, the *antahkarana * only. *Trupti * is *upalakshana * to *tushti*.

All these three - *trupti, tushti, svasthataa*, all belong to the mind. So, go and ask the mind, why are you asking me? The *aatman* does not come into contact with this.

*Sarvagata * and *vyaapee * is told for *jeevaatman*. How can it be told for *jeevaatman * who is *anu*? This needs explanation. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Pumaan iti | Na atra pumso gaganavat parama mahatvena gamana aadi   
nishidhyate, tathaa sati sarvagata vyaapi padayoh pounarukhtyaat |*** *Aakaasha * is said to be *parama mahat*, is present everywhere. Because of that, it does not have *gamana*, movement. Just like *aakaasha, aatman * is not meant to be told here as *parama mahat*. That is why *gamana * is not there - this is not the reason. If that had been the case, *sarvagata * and *vyaapee * would not be proper - it would have been *punarukti*, which is not generally done when *svaroopa lakshana * is told. 



*Paramaanu * is the most minute thing, and *parama mahat * is the biggest thing. *Aakaasha * is *parama mahat*. Page **272** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **



*Gamana, aagamana * is not there, not because *jeevaatman * is *parama **mahat * like *aakaasha*. 



***Poorvatra gamana anumatyaa parimitatva abhyupagamaat, sootra virodhaat   
cha na para mahatvam aatmanah |*** Earlier, *gamama * was told, and it is also accepted that he is any *svaroopa*, very subtle. In *Sutra * also, it is told that " *Naanuh atat shruteh iti*". *Poorva paksha * says that *aatman * is not *anu. Shruti * says " *Na cha aananytyaaya kalpate*". When the *jeevaatman svaroopa * is being told, *sootra virodha * will happen if that had been the case. 



*Shruti * tells clearly about *jeevaatman * that *gamana, aagamana*, are very clearly told. And *aatman's * characteristics are told in the Second *Adhyaaya*, *Third Paada*. It is clearly established that *aatman * is *anu svaroopa*. 



It is also told *Vaalaagra shata bhaagasya shatadhaa kalpitasya cha | **Bhaago jeevasya vijnyeyah ... *The same *Shruti * also says " *Sa cha aanantyaaya kalpate*". *Aanantya * is through his *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and not in *svaroopa*. 



So, there will be *virodha * with *Shruti * and *Sootra * if that is accepted - that it is *parama **mahat*. So, we have to understand that though it is said as *aakaashavat*, it is not because he is *parama mahat*. Other sutraas said - *Upaadaanaat vihaaropadeshaat cha*, he moves around in the body. When he leaves this body also, he goes in *Archiraadi **maarga*, and reaches *Paramaatman *- all these are clearly told in the *Sutras*. So *Sutra **virodha * will also happen if it is told that *aatman * is *parama mahat*. So, that is not the meaning here. ***   
Ayam arthah - sarvagatah - sarvatra deva aadi dehe avasthitah ayam aatmaa,   
vyaapee niravayavatvena ati sookshmatvaat sarva achetana vyaapana sheelah |*** This is the correct meaning. That he can enter into any body, anywhere in the *Prakruti mandala*. There are innumerable, *ananta koti jeevaas * in the *Prakruti **mandala*. They are all in different bodies. So he can be anywhere in any body. This is the meaning of sarvagata. He is present in deva, manushya, krimi, keeta. *Vyaapee * means that is *niravayavi*, part-less, he is extremely subtle in proportion. He can pervade all the *achetanaas*, however *sookshma * the *achetana * is. 



***Atah asya niravayavasya amoortasya cha aakaashaadivat ati soukshmymatvaat   
svato gamana aagamane na bhavatah |*** *Amoorta * means that he cannot be perceived by our *maamsa chakshus*. And he is part-less. *Aakaasha * is also very subtle. By himself, he cannot move and come. Means that Page **273** of **297   
**www.sadagopan.org** 



**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **he always needs a *shareera * for movement. 



***Yathaa iha sarvagataanaam amoortaanaam jaati guna aadeenaam svatah kriyaa   
naasti, kintu aashraya dvaaraa deshaantara praaptih |*** *Jaati, guna*, are also present everywhere - *deva, manushya, pashu, pakshi *- so many *jaatis * are there in all the beings. We see *jaati, guna * everywhere. They are all amoorta. *Jaati * cannot move. We cannot separate *guna * from *dravya * in which it is residing. Through the object in which it is residing, movement happens for *jaati, **guna*. Like this, through the object in which it is residing. 



***Evam amoortasya aatmano api deha dvaaraa deshaantara praaptih, yathaa   
savaahanasya pangoh |*** In the same way, *aatman * also is *amoorta*, like a lame person who sits on a vehicle and moves. Just like this, the *jeevaatman * also needs an *aashraya * for movement. He has *deha * as *aashraya*. When he dies, he takes *sookshma shareera * from body to body. Even when he goes to *moksha*, there is *sookshma shareera*. Due to the power of *upaasanaa * or *prapatti*, he gets a special *sookshma shareera * using which he goes in *archiraadi maarga*. So, he needs a *deha * for *aashraya * for movement. ***   
Yathaa uktam poorvatra \* Aham tvam cha tathaa anye cha bhooteruhyaama   
paarthiva | \* Upabhoga nimittam cha sarvatra gamana kriyaa | \* Upabhoga   
nimittam cha deshaat deshaantara aagamah \* ityaadi |*** It was told earlier in this *Vishnu Puraana * itself. *Bharata * told this to the *Souveera **Raaja * in the beginning, when *Souveera Raaja * said that "You are carrying my palanquin, and I am being carried", that "You and I are all being carried by the *pancha bhootaas*". The same questions - "Where are you coming from", "Where are you going", were asked by *Souveera Raja * to *Bharata * also. He had said that a person moved everywhere in order to experience the results of one's *karma * only. *Bhoga * is *karma phala anubhava*. This is the reason why *jeevaatman * moves around in different *dehaas*; for every *karma*, the *phala * is very well decided that in this particular *deha*, in this particular place, *desha*, in this particular time, *kaala*, he will be experiencing this. This is very well decided. In order to experience that, he takes a particular body, goes to a particular place, at a particular time, and experiences the results of *karmaas*. One moves around from place to place to experience the *karma phala*. 



***Evam poorva apara virodhaat ayam eva arthah | Asya tava etat vachah katham   
arthavat iti anvayah |*** So, in order that there is no contradiction between what was taught earlier and what is taught now, this is how the meaning has to be understood. Because of this, how can you ask "Where are you coming from?" , "Where are you going?", etc. Because he can be present in anybody, anywhere, and is all pervading. He resides in a body and can move around anywhere. He is very *sookshma*, can enter into the Page **274** of **297

Just as I am not the doer of this coming, going, etc., in the same way, you and other individual selves are also like that only. One cannot say that "I am going", you also cannot say like that, and others also cannot say like that. What you meant about the movement, coming, going, etc. - you meant the *aatman * itself in your question, but that is not the truth, not reality. You meant the body, when you said "Where did you come from". This applies to you also. He explains the *aatma svaroopa* and answers like this.

Whatever is *mrushtaanna*, the most enjoyable food, tasty food - that itself will be not enjoyable in some other time, to the same person. So, *mrushtaanna* itself can cause trouble to him. So, it is not natural to the food itself. 



For one who eats, is a food which he does not like, all the time like that? Or is some food, which is enjoyable, always tasty, all the time like that? There is nothing like that, is the meaning. When *amrushtaanna * itself becomes *mrushtaanna*, food which is disliked at some time, itself becomes very tasty, and tasty food itself causes one to be troubled at some other time, and they don't like it, it is said that it is not *svaabhaavika*, not natural to the food itself. One itself is *mrushta*, it itself is *amrushta*, it has got both applicable to the same food. This is why we can infer clearly that it is not natural to the food itself. ***

Because of the *karma*, because of the *upaadhi * that he has got a body, that he is enjoying, doing all these things, but they are not in reality the *karmaas * of the *aatman*. 



In all the bodies, it is in the same way. All the *jeevaatmans * in all the bodies are similar. Knowing all these is *samatva*. That will lead you to *moksha*.

Because He lives everywhere, He is called *Vaasudeva. Svaroopa * is His *shareera. *Page **279** of **297

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) ***Shareera, roopa, vapu, tanu*, are told. It is clearly told that *aatma * is also *shareera * to Him. These are all told very clearly in the *Shrutis. Aatma svaroopa * is being explained here. The concluding part of the *aatma svaroopa*, that mind which thinks that all *aatmans * are equal or similar, that they are all *jnyaana eka aakaara*, all are similar in nature, they only will lead one to *moksha*. Whole world is the *shareera * of *Vaasudeva, Paramaatman*, that also you have to understand as - the *ekatva * which is told with respect to *aatman*, is *jnyaana eka aakaaratayaa **samatvam eva*; is the similarity or equality of all being *jnyaana eka aakaara*. It is not *svaroopa aikya*. This world which is made up of *chit * and *achit*, sentient and non-sentient beings, are all *shareera * of *Vaasudeva*; it was also told that one *dravya * cannot become another *dravya*; so it cannot be *svaroopa aikya*, then *svaroopa naasha * would happen which is not possible. Because of this, the whole world is taken as *shareera*, as told in *Antaryaami Braahmana*, in *Bruhadaaranyakopanishad * in much detail. The whole world is told as *shareera * of *Vaasudeva*; *aatma * and *Paramaatman * are one, is not the *abhipraaya * of *Maharshi Paraasharar * here; so *aikya * is not meant here. 



There is *jeeva - Paramaatma saamya*, because both are *jnyaana svaroopa. **Jeevaatman * is *anu, Paramaatman * is *vibhu*, in *svaroopa * itself. *Jeevaatman * is *anu * in *svaroopa*, but he can be present everywhere, in every body, in every achetana, so he is told to be *sarvagata*. He can pervade everything, can be moving around everywhere. Through *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, in *moksha*, he is all-pervading, *aanantyaaya kalpate*. So, it is not *svaroopa **aikya * between *aatma * and *Paramaatman. Aatma-aatma saamya, aatma-Paramaatma **saamya * are told in *Bhagavad Gita * also. Every *aatman * is of the same nature as *jnyaana **eka aakaara*. So, it is not identity, it is similarity. The *shareera vaachi shabdaas * also denote the *shareeri*. So, " *aham*" can go up to *shareeri * also. So, any name told can also go up to *Paramaatman*. So, every name, and every form - there is a *jeevaatman * and *Paramaatman * also. He is *antaryaami*, present as *aatman * in everything. So, all names and forms can also denote *Paramaatman * in the ultimate analysis, *aparyavasaana vrutti*. 



*Chetana achetana aatmaka jagat * is *Paramaatman's shareera, Vaasudeva shareera*. It is not told that *aatman * and *Paramaatman * are one.

We have one more Chapter left in this *Amsha*. In Chapter 15, *Mahaayogi Bharata * was reciting the story of *Rubhu * and *Nidaagha * to *Souveera Mahaaraaja*, and he teaches him that *aatma jnyaana * and then leaves that place. After that, again, he comes, visits after a long time, and this is continued in Chapter 16.

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Uktasya aatma saamyasya darshanam chira kaala yoga saadhyam iti

Why does he come back? *Rubhu * knew that whatever he had taught to *Nidaagha*, takes a long time to put to practice. That *jnyaana * has to come through *anushthaana*. It is a difficult thing and takes a long time. One has to be practicing this yoga for a long time. Then only, they can reach the perfection of *aatma saamya darshana*. So, he comes back after a thousand years. This also shows the compassion of the *aachaarya*, that they do not leave the *shishyaas * half way through. They teach and make sure that the *jnyaana * is brought to *anusthanaa*. They themselves come and teach.

**SrI VishNu PurANam \(Vol. 2\) **word *tat*, that *tat * is *aatman. Aham, tvam*, etc. are told in *saamaanaadhikaranya*, in the same *vibhakti*.

They can actually qualify the same object - this is *saamaanaadhikaranya. **Bhinna pravrutti nimittaanaam shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih **saamaanaadhikaranyam*. Here, the words *tat, aham, tvam *- are all told. They are all qualifying the same object, *aatman*, which is *jnyaanaikaakaara*. The *aatmans * are different in each. *Tvam * means the *aatman * who is in you. *Aham * means the *aatman * who is in me. Object is *aatman*, but *jnyaanaikaakaara * is what is meant here. The forms of all these are *jnyaanaikaakaara * only. Don't have the wrong understanding that *aatmans * are different. Because of the form of the external appearance that you see, *deva, manushya*, but inside, all are of the similar essential nature.

But, what is told here is the *aatma svaroopa * which is different and distinct from the body, is what is taught here. *Aham, tvam, sarvam*, would not have made sense if that was not the case. Because the bodies are all different. Appearances are different but *jeevaatman * inside has the same form. *Aham, tvam, sarvam etat*, this *bheda * would not have been possible.

How do we say this? *Aatman * is different from body. *Aatman * is different from *indriyaas, aatman * is different from the *manas*, one by one, he teaches. The gist of this is *deha aatma viveka*. What is being taught is that *aatman * is different from the body. This is how the *upadesha * started. Body which is having the head, hand, etc. is different from the *aatman*. ***   


Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 24:   
Sri Paraasharah -   
Iteeritah tena sa raaja varyah tatyaaja bhedam paramaartha drushtih |   
Sa chaapi jaati smaranana aapta bodhah tatra eva janmani apavargam aapa ||*** *Sri Paraasharar *- Having realized the *paramaartha * that all *aatmans * are of the same *jnyaana svaroopa*, they are all *jnyaanaikaakaara * and are all similar in their essential nature, the *Souveera Raaja * realized the *jnyaanaikaakaara * of all the *aatmans. Bharata muni* also, who had *jaati smarana*, who remembered who he was in his previous birth, also attained *moksha * in the same *janma*. Page **290** of **297

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 2, Chapter 16, Shloka 25:   
Iti bharata narendra saara vruttam kathayati yah cha shrunoti bhakti yuktah |   
Sa vimalamatireti na aatma moham bhavati cha samsaraneshu mukti yogyah ||*** One who, with great devotion, either tells this, or listens to this story, the gist of this *upadesha*, that the *mahaa yogi Bharata * told to *Souveera Mahaaraaja*, his mind becomes purified and he will not have the *moha*, wrong knowledge of the nature of *aatman * being the body. He becomes eligible for liberation among the embodied souls. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Iti iti | Saara vruttam saarabhootam vruttam | Samsaraneshu aatma moham na   
iti, mukti yogyah mukti saamraajya yogyah cha bhavati iti anvayah |*** Those who are in this *samsaara*, he will realize the *aatman * here itself, he will see *jnyaanaikaakaara * everywhere, that the body is different from *aatman*. He becomes eligible to go to *moksha*. 



This concludes the *Amsha * 2, Chapter 16.
