*Balaraama* who is very powerful, is ignorant about gambling, but even then, is very much addicted to gambling. So, let us win over *Balaraama* through gambling. Anyway, we cannot fight with him and win.

This time, *Balaraama* won the one crore *Nishkaas* which he had kept. And he shouted loudly - "I have won, I have won". And then, *Rukmi* also said that "I had won. You are telling lies".

He said - "When I was about to throw the dice, you only told some number. I did not say anything and I did not accept that number, If you say that you have won over, why should I not say that I have won over? I never got a chance, and will not accept what you said". 



Both have to agree to the bet and the game. If the other one has not agreed, how can you say that you have won?

What that voice said was -

The voice said that - *Balaraama* has only won over, and this is the proper dharma. He followed the dharma, and he has won over, and *Rukmi* is telling lies. Even if he  [[278]] of 399 



www.sadagopan.org



did not say that he had agreed or not, though he did not express, since he threw the dice, he actually played, it means that he had agreed only. 



Though he did not say whether he accepted the bet or not, he threw the dice anyway. This means that he has accepted the bet. He acted as though he has accepted, which means that he has accepted only. The voice from the skies said this. 





*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 28, Shloka 23: *****ततो * *****र्िः * *****तम् * *****उत्थाय * *****कोपसांरक्तिोचनः * | *****जघान * *****अषटापदेन * *****एर्व * *****रुस्क्मणां * *****स * *****महार्िः * *****॥ * *****२३ * *****॥ *

*

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 28, Shloka 28: *****ततो * *****तनरुद्धम् * *****आदाय * *****कृतदारां * *****द्वर्वजोत्तम * | *****द्र्वारकामाजगामाथ * *****यदुचक्रां * *****च * *****केशर्वः * *****॥ * *****२८ * *****॥ * ***And He took *Aniruddha* along with his wife, and came back to *Dwaarakaa*.
