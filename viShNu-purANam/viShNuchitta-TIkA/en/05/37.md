Having reduced the weight of the evil forces on this earth, having killed all the evil kings, *Krishna* also destroyed His own *kula* in the end, because of a curse. 



The *Brahmins* had given a curse to Krishna, and this was only a pretext, *vyaaja*. With His own will, He was the cause of the destruction of His clan. This was how it had to happen, and *Krishna* knowingly did all of that. It was out of His own will that He also destroyed the *Yaadava kula* itself in the end.

Having left *Dwaarakaa*, and having given up His *manushya deha* which He had taken during His *avataara*, along with His *amsha, Balaraama, Krishna* went to *Paramapada, Vishnumaya sthaana*. 



*Krishna* gave up His human body, which was looking like that, which He had taken during His *avataara*. His *avataara* is also His *apraakruta divya* *mangala vigraha* only. It looked like He had taken a human body. He left, along with *Balaraama* and others. His *tejas*, His *vibhooti*, was completely present there. The words *Paramapada, Paramavyoma* are told, which are unique to Him only, His place. It is told in *Mousala Puraana* that it is *divya, apraakruta*. 



Here, *maanushyam* is told as an attribute for Him. It means His *divya* *mangala **vigraha*, divine auspicious form only. This is the *pramaana* given in the *Mousala **Puraana*.
