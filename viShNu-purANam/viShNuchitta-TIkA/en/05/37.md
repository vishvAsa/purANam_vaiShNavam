Having reduced the weight of the evil forces on this earth, having killed all the evil kings, *Krishna* also destroyed His own *kula* in the end, because of a curse. 



The *Brahmins* had given a curse to Krishna, and this was only a pretext, *vyaaja*. With His own will, He was the cause of the destruction of His clan. This was how it had to happen, and *Krishna* knowingly did all of that. It was out of His own will that He also destroyed the *Yaadava kula* itself in the end.

Having left *Dwaarakaa*, and having given up His *manushya deha* which He had taken during His *avataara*, along with His *amsha, Balaraama, Krishna* went to *Paramapada, Vishnumaya sthaana*. 



*Krishna* gave up His human body, which was looking like that, which He had taken during His *avataara*. His *avataara* is also His *apraakruta divya* *mangala vigraha* only. It looked like He had taken a human body. He left, along with *Balaraama* and others. His *tejas*, His *vibhooti*, was completely present there. The words *Paramapada, Paramavyoma* are told, which are unique to Him only, His place. It is told in *Mousala Puraana* that it is *divya, apraakruta*. 



Here, *maanushyam* is told as an attribute for Him. It means His *divya* *mangala **vigraha*, divine auspicious form only. This is the *pramaana* given in the *Mousala **Puraana*.

*Sri Paraasharar* - The rishis had the divine knowledge, which means that they had *Bhagavaan's* will. The rishis knew the will of the Lord. In *Mousala* *Puraana*, it is told that - Though He was capable of stopping it, He did not do so, because He knew that that is how it has to happen. 



The rishis were cheated by the *Yadukumaaraas*, but they had the divine knowledge, the will of the Lord, and they got very angry. They said that he is going to give birth to a mace, *musala*.

Whoever were the causes of the evil weight on the earth, *Jaraasandha* and others, were all destroyed by Me. Nobody has been left. Only the *Yaadavaas* have been left here, and I have not destroyed the *Yaadavaas*. I need to do that work also. The weight on the earth, of the evil forces, of *Yaadavaas*, is much more than even *Jaraasandha* and others. I am going to destroy that also.

Respecting the curse of the *Brahmins*, and respecting whatever *Durvaasa* had told, He made His legs in the form of a *Svastikaasana*, on His knee, and sat in *Yogaasana*. 



In the *Mahaabhaarata*, it is said that *Durvaasa* asked *Krishna* to smear His entire body with what *Durvaasa* had eaten and left. *Krishna* thought that the food eaten and left by a *Brahmin*, should not be touched with the foot. So, *Krishna* did not smear it for His foot, but smeared it for the rest of His body. *Durvaasa* got very angry and asked "Why did You not smear it on Your feet? You will be hit on the foot itself", and gave Him a curse. Because of this, *Krishna* sat in that position, to respect *Durvaasa's* curse, and also curse of the *Brahmins*.
