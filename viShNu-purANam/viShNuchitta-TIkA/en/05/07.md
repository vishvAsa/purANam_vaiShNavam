 ***Sri Paraasharar - Without Balaraama accompanying Him, Sri Krishna went to Vrundaavana and was surrounded all around by group of friends, gopaas, and they decorated with garlands of the flowers, which were available in the forest, and they were all looking very bright and nice.

They were going near the river *Kaalindi*, where the serpent was there, and *Balaraama* told *Krishna* not to go near that alone. But, once, *Krishna* went without *Balaraama*, being accompanied by the *gopaas*.

 ***He was roaming around all around the place. When He was roaming around that place, they came near the *Kaalindi* river, and how that *Kaalindi* river was, is told by *Sri Paraasharar*. That *Kaalindi* river had huge tides all over, and with the white foam at the banks, it looked as though the *Kaalindi* river was smiling with that all around. 



Here is given an exaggeration, because the foam is white, it looked as though the river was smiling. Or, it was like the burning charcoal all around, because of the ashes which were there, along with the foam.

 ***There was one part, a pool, where it was very deep, and was filled with poisonous fire, the water was burning with poison, as though like fire. It was very fierce, that pool. That was the residing place of *Kaaliya sarpa*, serpent, and *Krishna* along with His friends, saw that fierce deep pool there. ***

 ***One who has the poisonous weapon, *Kaaliya*, the evil serpent, is living in this pool. Having been defeated by Me, this evil serpent should go back to the ocean. 



This evil serpent was defeated by *Garuda*, who is also a *vibhooti* of Krishna only. So, " *mayaa*" is told as " *mat vibhooti bhootena*". This evil serpent was not seen by Garuda, otherwise, he would have been driven away or killed, so he was hiding in the waters that time. He has escaped from the ocean, and has come into this *Kaalindi* river, this pool, because of a story in *Bhaagavata* which is referred here. Garuda was cursed by *Soubhari. Garuda* was interested in eating the fishes living there, and *Soubhari* cursed him not to come there. So, Garuda could not enter into this particular *Kaalindi* river, so, *Kaaliya* was very safe there. So, *Kaaliya* came and lived there.

The *Yamunaa* river, which goes and joins the ocean, is completely poisoned, and because of that, either humans or cows, when they are very thirsty, cannot even touch the waters.

 ***Nearby there was a *Kadamba* tree. I will climb on that tree, and will jump into this pool where the *Kaaliya* is living, He thought so. 



How that *Kadamba* tree did not get burnt is explained. It is told in other *Puraanaas* that when *Garuda* was carrying the *Amruta*, he crossed over this tree, and a drop of *Amruta* fell on this, and so nothing has happened to this tree.

 ***I have done wrong here, because of being ignorant. You have punished me. I have to tolerate this, and this is only going to do good to me. 



*Kaaliya* says - Even then, I am one who is ignorant, O Lord of the world. You have punished me. I have to bear that punishment. It is only going to do good to me. 



It is only going to do good to me. I have to accept this. 



It is only going to do good to me, so I have to tolerate this. There is a *paathaantara*, which means - It is only going to do good to me, and even the  [[89]] of 399

punishment given by You is better than a boon given by others. Even a punishment given by You is good to me. Like this, *Kaaliya* eulogizes *Krishna*. 



*Aachaaryaas* say that " *Rosho api preetaye syaat", Bhagavaan* when He punishes also, it will do some good only.

I have lost all my power and poison, and I have been controlled by You, O *Achyuta*. I am praying for my life. Do order me. What is the order now? What do I do? Please do order me. 



*Kaaliya* prayed like this. We saw the prayers of Kaaliya's wives, and also *Kaaliya's* prayers. Such beautiful *stotra* on *Krishna*, eulogizing Him as a Supreme Lord. We see this further. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 5. Where the serpent king *Kaaliya* eulogized *Krishna*, His *paratva*, etc. in a wonderful way. And he says that he has only done what is natural to his birth, as he is a serpent, and it is *Krishna's* order only, that He has established all these things. "Even then, if I have done something wrong, do pardon me", he requests *Krishna*.
