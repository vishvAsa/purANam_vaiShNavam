*Taara, Mandra* are loud sounds, without opening the lips - it was a mix of both. There is also another *paatha - naanaamaatrakrutakramam*, and also *naanaatantrikutakramam*. These mean the sound of the mixture of all the wonderful instruments, whose beats are very slow, or medium paced. The words of that song were not loud enough to be heard by everyone, but they were *avyakta*, unmanifest. It was so sweet and loving to all the women. *Krishna* started to sing that kind of a song.

One *gopi* started to move, just following the beats of this song. One rare *gopi* started to walk towards that slowly, following the beats of this song. And focussing fully on thinking about Krishna, meditating in the mind on Krishna only. 



*Raasa Kreedaa* is going to be told in detail now, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 13 of *Amsha* 5. We concluded the *Govardhana **Uddharana prakarana*, and had just started *Raasa Leelaa prakarana* of *Sri **Krishna*. 



*Krishna* sees the most wonderful moonlight, of the *Sharat kaala* in the clear skies. All the lily flowers have bloomed, and all the directions are bright with the moonlight. He saw all the plants and greenery around, and the bees humming. Seeing all these, He decided to sport with the *gopis. Balaraama* was not there with *Krishna*. At that time, He decided to sing the song which produces the most beautiful sounds, which are not manifest to everyone. This sound is most loved by the *gopis*. He started to play that song, with high and low notes, and with *different kaalaas - dhruta, madhya, vilambita* in the three *maatraas*. And also which can produce the sounds of various instruments like *Veenaa*. There are different explanations for this in the different *paathaantaraas*.
