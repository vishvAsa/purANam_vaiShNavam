*Raama* and *Krishna* both were wandering around, sporting around in the forest; at that time, the rainy season just passed, and the lotuses bloomed, and autumn set in.

 ***Each of these descriptions will have some comparison with the *Aatma vidyaa. **Shapharya* is a type of fish. In the waters, these fish started to experience a lot of heat. When a *gruhasta* is having this feeling of *mamatva*, idea of possession, because of the attachment to children, land, etc., the idea of possession tortures a *gruhasta*. The fish suffered just like that. 



While describing the wonderful autumn season, *Paraasharar* is also telling the details of *Aatma vidyaa*, the *upaasanaa*.

It was as though, when yogis, when they realize that *samsaara* is *asaara*, having got dejected from the cycle of births and deaths, they become *mounis*; they start to meditate on the Supreme Lord. Just like that, the peacocks became quiet, just like the *yogis*. ***

Just as the rain clouds give up all the water, the yogis gave up all the *ahamkaara*, and *mamakaara*. Clouds gave up the blackness because there was no more water, the yogis who have realized, got rid of the defects like *raaga, dvesha*, etc., they became pure. The clouds became white and clear, and like this, the yogis became pure, their minds became very pure. The *jnyaanis* give up all the *virodha*. 



Each shloka is giving a description of the *sharat kaala*, with many of the words having the meaning of *aatma vidyaa* also. This is being explained further. There are many more wonderful *shlokaas* like this. Which we see next. 



Having given up all the waters, through rain, the sky became very clear. The clouds gave up all water through rain. The sky became clear without any clouds. It was as though the wise ones, knowledgeable ones, the enlightened ones, they leave their houses and go for meditation, tapas. 



Having given up the *ahamkaara*, their minds became pure. The blackness with respect to the clouds; the rain bearing clouds are black, and when they pour down the rain, the waters are no more there, they become clear. With respect to yogis, they gave up the *raaga, dvesha*, etc., and their minds became clean. The skies became clear, and with respect to yogis, their mind became pure.

they get; their mind becomes clear. With enlightenment, they attain *samatva, **"Samatvam yoga uchyate" * is from the *Gita*. They see everything as equal. They see *aatman* everywhere. 



The pools started to have all the lilies in the waters. The pure minded ones.

Among the *saadhus*, if a *yogi* is there, who has attained the yoga saturation, just as he shines forth, the full moon was shining forth in the sky full of stars.

In *Yoga*, it is explained - *klesha, antaraaya. Antaraaya* is *samshaya, pramaada, **aalasya*, etc.

 ***Everywhere, the waters were very pure and clear. As though the great devotees, those who are devoted to Vishnu, when they realize *Bhagavaan* *Vishnu* who is all pervading, then their minds become so pure and clear. 



*Sarvatra* means at all places, and towards all kinds of people, friends or enemies. Their minds become very clear. The clear waters are compared to the clear minds of the *saadhus*. 



This is also told in *Srimad Raamaayana* as *Prasannaambu. Ramaneeyam **prasannambu sanmanuyashya mano yathaa*. The mind of a noble person is like the clear waters. 



 [[110]] of 399

*Sarvatra* is also told as friends, enemies, etc. This is also told as the sign of a Vishnu devotee, which we studied earlier in *Vishnu Puraana*. He is equally disposed towards himself, friends or enemies.

The autumn sky was looking just like that, very clear.

The sky was made clear. The dust of the earth got removed. The dirt in the waters was removed. Waters became pure and the earth became clear and dust free. The sky also became clear without clouds. In *yoga, pratyaahaara* is told - withdrawing all the senses from the sense objects. Just as the *pratyaahaara* detaches the senses from the sense objects, in the same way, the *Sharat kaala* cleared the sky, the earth and the waters.

 ***The pools collected the waters, and this is told as similar to *pooraka* of a yogi who is practicing *praanaayaama* everyday. A yogi practicing *praanaayaama* first takes in the air \( *pooraka*\), then keeps it still for some time \( *kumbhaka*\), and then leaves it \( *rechaka*\). The ponds were taking water from the canal, collecting it, storing for some time, and then giving them for all the plants. It was as though they were practicing *praanaayaama* like the *yogis*. 



*Pooraka, Kumbhaka * and *Rechaka* are explained. The ponds themselves are in the place of yogis. From the canals, they collect water as a yogi does *pooraka* in *praanaayaama*. After that, they collect the waters, similar to the air that is taken in by the yogis during *praanaayaama*; they store it and give it back for the plants to grow. It is as though they are practicing *praanaayaama*.

Garga* and others have told *Varshaa kaala*, but  [[114]] of 399

this is *Sharat kaala*. For this, some *pramaanaas* are given here from *Harivamsha* - in the four months, I will give You half, so Krishna takes away two months. So, two months become rainy season, and two months become autumn.
