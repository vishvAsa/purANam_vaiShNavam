He decided that he will take revenge against all the gods. That he will destroy all the *yaagaas*, because the gods get food only when *yaagaas* are performed, when *havis* is offered in the *yaagaas*. If *yaagaas* are not done, the gods don't get food. So, he thought that he will destroy all the *yajnyaas*, and then destroy the earth where the people live.

terror which he had created in the world, the kind of destruction which he had done. *Balaraama* put an end to this, and killed him without any effort. Having told about all the great things which *Balaraama* did during his *avataara, Maitreyar* is interested in knowing more, so *Paraasharar* continues.
