*Sri Paraasharar* - Having seen the wonderful acts of *Krishna*, the Supreme Lord, both of them \( *Devaki* and *Vasudeva*\) realized the truth, they had the real knowledge, what *Krishna* did was that He again brought them under the veil of *maayaa*. He again spread the *Vaishnavee maayaa* on them. They were again covered with *moha*. ***
