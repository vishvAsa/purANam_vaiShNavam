*Sri Paraasharar* - Before this story of *Aniruddha, Baana* went and bowed down to *Shiva*, and told with his thousand arms that "I am really bored, without any fight or war with a suitable person, this is boring".

If there is no war, no fight with someone who is suitable to fight with me, what is the purpose of these thousand arms? I am bearing this weight only. All these arms are simply dead weight for me.

*Sri Shankara* said - O *Baana*, when your *mayoora dhvaja* is broken, then you can assume that there will be a huge war, where a lot of people will die. *Yaksha, **pishaachaas* will be extremely pleased as they will have a lot of dead bodies to eat. Then *Baanaasura* felt very happy with this.

*Sri Paraasharar* - Having bowed down to *Ishvara, Baana* came back home. As soon as he came home, he saw that his *mayoora dhvaja* was broken. Then, he was over-pleased as there would definitely be some war coming.

In *Dwaaravati*, in the meanwhile, they were not seeing *Aniruddha*, he was missing. They were all searching for him - "Where did he go, where did he go?". At that time, *Naarada* came and said that *Baanaasura* had arrested him with the *Naaga paasha*.

*Naarada* told that *Aniruddha* had been taken by *Chitralekha*, using her special yogic powers. They were thinking that because they went and brought the *Paarijaata* tree from *Devaloka*, maybe they were all planning to do something bad, and had taken Aniruddha. But, *Naarada* cleared that doubt and said that *Chitralekha* had taken him with her *yogic* powers. 



In *Harivamsha*, it is told that because *Devaas* were not happy that the *Paarijaata* was taken by *Krishna*, maybe they had caught and taken *Aniruddha* away. This is what they *Yaadavaas* thought, but that doubt was cleared by *Naarada*, saying that *Chitralekha* had taken him with her *yogic* powers.

When He was trying to enter into the city, the *pramatha gana* of *Ishvara* \(who were with *Baana*, supporting him\), fought with *Krishna, Balaraama*, *Pradyumna*. *Krishna* killed all of them, and then approached *Baana's* capital city.

The *bhasma* which was created by that *jvara*, when *Krishna* came into contact with it, He developed a fever. And when *Balaraama* touched *Krishna*, he also got fever, and could not open his eyes also. 



Touching *Krishna's* body, *Baladeva* also got that fever.

This *Maaheshvara jvara* was totally getting destroyed by *Krishna*. At that time, *Pitaamaha, Chaturmukha Brahma* came and asked *Krishna* to pardon this *Maaheshvara jvara*, which was suffering from the *Vaishnava* *jvara* which *Krishna* used.
