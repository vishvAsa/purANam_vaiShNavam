All the three worlds, when they are protected by Your powerful arms, Your presence, O *Krishna*, and all the *yajnya amsha*, and *havis* with which the people perform and offer in the *yaagaas*, all of that the gods obtain properly, when all the evil forces are destroyed. The gods are all very satisfied and happy. 



*Indra* is eulogizing *Krishna* that He has done so many wonderful acts. He incarnated as a human and killed all the evil forces, and all gods are happy that they are getting the *havis*, and are all very satisfied. You did all these wonderful acts, destroying *Arishta, Dhenuka, Keshi, Pootanaa, Kuvalayaapeeda, Kamsa*.

How to take care of him, and destroy him, please do think over and find a way. 



*Sri Paraasharar* continues with *Krishna* going after *Narakaasura*, and next is the *Narakaasura vadha prakarana* which comes. We see this next. 



We are studying Chapter 29 of *Amsha* 5. Where *Indra* has just arrived and met *Sri **Krishna*, and tells Him about how *Narakaasura* is troubling everyone, and that he has stolen all valuable things from svarga, *Indraloka. Narakaasura* has stolen the *kundala* of Indra's mother Aditi, has stolen the *chatra* of *Varuna* himself, and the peak of *Meru* *parvata* itself. Now, *Narakaasura* is after the *Airaavata* elephant. Indra requests *Krishna* to do something so that *Narakaasura's* tortures will all stop, all his troubles will stop. 



*Indra* says that he has told all the bad things which *Narakaasura* is doing, and now requests *Krishna* to do whatever is right for this.

Immediately, *Krishna* thought of *Garuda*, and immediately, *Garuda* came there. Taking *Satyabhaama* also along, *Krishna* got onto *Garuda*, and started to go towards *Praagjyotishapura*, where *Narakaasura* was living. 



*Satyabhaama* was *Amsha* of *Bhoomidevi*. *Bhoomi's* son was *Narakaasura*, and *Krishna* had given a word that He would kill her son only with her permission, and since *Satyabhaama* was *Bhoomidevi's amsha*, He took *Satyabhaama* along, as He knew that He would destroy *Narakaasura*. In *Harivamsha* it is also told that *Naarada* brings a *Paarijaata* flower from *Devaloka*, and gives it to *Rukmini*. When *Satyabhaama* sees this, she is immediately jealous of *Rukmini*, that she got such a wonderful flower from heaven, and she did not get it. So, *Krishna* had told here that He would get her the entire tree itself. In order to fulfil this also, *Krishna* took *Satyabhaama* along with Him.

A demon by name *Mura* had created a huge strong net around *Praagjyotishapura*, which was as sharp as a razor's edge, in order to protect the city. So, nobody could enter into that city. *Praagjyotishapura* was covered like this all around.
