 ***Even if someone meditates on Him, and just remembers, that destroys all the sins. That form, that face of *Bhagavaan*, I am going to see. 



The form of *Krishna* is out of His own *sankalpa*, that He has incarnated here. *Aditi, **Devaki* worshipped *Bhagavaan* for many many years, and got a boon from Him that He will be born here, as their son. According to this, He takes the form of *deva*, *manushya*, as *Upendra, Krishna*. This is common to even *vibhava avataaras*. In the *Bhagavad Gita, Krishna* says that "Whatever form one worships Me in, I will  [[170]] of 399

reveal Myself to them in the same form". *Taam tathaa eva bhajaami*, where *bhajaami* *upaasanaa* means *darshayaami* according to *Bhaashyakaarar*. Even in the, when one meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, in their *hrudaya*, He gives a similar experience to them. Or, He takes different forms out of His own will. In the meditation also, whatever form we see outside, we have to think of the same form inside also, inside our mind.

Just before sunset, when the Sun was just setting, at that time, *Akroora* reached *Gokula*, all the time thinking with great devotion, about *Sri Krishna*. 



At *Gokula, Akroora* sees *Krishna's* wonderful form and eulogizes Him. How he sees this wonderful form of *Krishna*, and the *darshana* that he gets, and things which happen after that, are going to start from here, which we see next. 



We are doing *arthaanusandhaana* of Chapter 17 of *Amsha* 5. Where *Akroora* has been sent by *Kamsa*, to bring *Krishna* and *Balaraama* to the *Dhanuryajnya*, with the wicked idea that he wants to eliminate Them. All the *gopaas* also bring in plenty of milk, butter, curd, etc., to offer to *Kamsa*. While coming, *Akroora* is thinking of the wonderful *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan Krishna*, and is continuously meditating on this, and his entire *janma* has become *saphala* because he is going to behold *Bhagavaan Sri Krishna*, right in front of his eyes. He has just reached *Gokula*.

If He places His lotus hands on my back, just as friend hugs another friend, the touch of even a finger of *Sri Krishna*, means that all the sins are completely destroyed, and they will attain all the benefits. 



*Bhagavaan's* lotus hands will cause complete purity, and eliminate all the sins of the person who gets His touch. This is explained in three *shlokaas* here. *Shreemat* is the attribute of *hasta-padma*, means that it is very *shreshtha, shree yukta*. 



Three *shlokaas* are going to explain the *mahimaa*, or wonderful characteristics of His wonderful hands and palms.

When *Bhagavaan's* grace, he had all the enjoyments in *Paataala*. He also attained *amaratva*, and became Indra, got Indra pada in another manvantara. All his enemies were destroyed. That is the greatness of the lotus hands of *Krishna*.

 ***I have not committed any sins, and I do not have any defects, but because *Kamsa* has taken me as his assistant, I am subordinated to *Kamsa*, and am now subjected to all kinds of defects, being a part of *Kamsa's* group, and having all the *doshaas*, being very defective now. Will He neglect me, or ridicule me because I have been subordinated to *Kamsa*, and doing service to him. If that happens, then my birth itself is futile, and let nobody get this kind of birth, where all the *saadhu janaas* reject him. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 17, Shloka 32:  *****ज्ञानात्मकस्य* *****अमिसत्त्र्वराशेः* *****अपेतदोर्षस्य* *****सदा* *****स्फुटस्य* | *****क्रकां* *****र्वा* *****जगतत* *****अत्र* *****समस्त* *****पुांसाम्* *****अज्ञातमस्य* *****अस्स्त* *****हृहद* *****स्स्थतस्य* *****॥* *****३२* *****॥ *

In the entire world, what is there which He does not know, because He is present in the hearts of every being. 



Because He is *sarvajnya*, He knows that I do not have any sin, I am sinless, and He will definitely accept me. *Amalasattva* is *sattva* without any defects; because all the *chetanaas*, though in *svaroopa* are *jnyaanaatmaka* and are subjected to defects because of association with *prakruti* of the nature of rajas and tamas, but in nature they are all *jnyaanaatmaka*. But, *Bhagavaan* is not like that, he is *amalasattva*; He is pure sattva, without any *doshaas*; He is not having rajas and tamas. His *svaroopa* is never covered.

With great devotion, and having the feeling of complete subordination, I am going to see *Krishna*. He is the Supreme Lord, Lord of lords. He is the very *amsha* of *Purushottama*. I am going to approach *Bhagavaan Sri Krishna, Akroora* thinks to himself.
