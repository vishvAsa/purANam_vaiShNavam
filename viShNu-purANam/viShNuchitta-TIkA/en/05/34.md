All the gods, *Shankara, Indra*, and others, do all kinds of things, because of which *Krishna* has to go and protect them, and perform some wonderful acts Himself. Whatever He did, the divine acts of His, and the *cheshtaas* that *devaas* do, in order to take care of all that, *Krishna* also does some *divya cheshtitaas*. These  [[334]] of 399

There is a *Pundra desha*, and *Poundraka* was the king of that place. He was called *Poundraka Vaasudeva*. Everyone thought that he was real *Krishna* only. People who were ignorant, started telling him that "You are the real *Krishna*, You are only *Vaasudeva*, incarnated here".

He really started to think that he is only *Vaasudeva*, and has incarnated on this earth. He forgot his earlier identity, and started to believe that he was really *Vaasudeva* only. He started to sport all the signs of *Vishnu*, like *Shankha, Chakra*, etc., which he starts to make for himself.

"I am going to surrender unto you, in such a way that I am not going to be afraid of you anymore". 



He has told "Come here". Another meaning is explained as "Having come there, I am going to torture or kill you". When the enemy is totally tortured or killed, then there will be no more fear of the enemy. That is what he really meant, and he did not understand it.

*Krishna* saw that he was wearing the *Vanamaalaa* garland also, and also the *Peeta **vasana*, the yellow cloth also, and he has a *dhvaja*, on which there is *Garuda*. On his chest, there was the *Shreevatsa* mark also. Just like all those which *Krishna* had.

We saw the story of *Poundraka Vaasudeva*, in Chapter 34, where *Poundraka **Vaasudeva* sent a messenger to Him, asking Him to come and surrender all His weapons, and that he is the real *Vaasudeva*. *Krishna* comes and destroys all his things, and is surprised to see that *Poundraka* *Vaasudeva* has made all the signs so wonderfully that it almost looks real. *Krishna* tells *Poundraka*, that he told Him to surrender all the weapons, and that now, He is giving all of them, and leaves His *Sudarshana Chakra*. *** ***
