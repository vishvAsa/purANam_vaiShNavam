 ***Then *Akroora* realized what is the truth. Then he prayed to and eulogized the *Sarvajnya, Achyuta*, who is the Lord, *Krishna. Akroora* starts to eulogize. 



Now, the *Akroora Stuti* is going to start, which we see next. We are studying of Chapter 18 of *Amsha* 5, where *Akroora* is sent by *Kamsa*, and is taking back *Krishna* and *Balaraama*, to *Mathura*, with *Kamsa's* bad intentions. On the way, he stopped to do his *maadhyaahnika*, and at that time, he takes a dip in the river. He sees the most wonderful sight, where he has the *saakshaatkaara* of *Bhagavaan*. He sees *Krishna* and *Balaraama* there. He then starts to eulogize *Bhagavaan*, based on that wonderful sight that he had.

 ****Akroora* - He does not have the *shat bhaava vikaaraas*. This is not contradicting the mere existence, *sattaa maatra. Nityatva* and others are not negated, but only the *bhaava vikaaraas* are negated. There are so many wonderful attributes which are *asaadhaarana gunaas* of *Paramaatman*; nobody can even think of His greatness. He is the *Paramaatman*, the Supreme Self. He is all pervading. He has got many forms. He is also *ekasvaroopa*, one unique *svaroopa*. I bow down to that Supreme Self. I bow down to that *Paramaatman*.

The *shat bhaava vikaaraas* are *Asti, Jaayate, Vardhate, Viparinamate, **Apaksheeyate, Nashyati*. In the state of effect, where everything is created, after *Brahman* does *anupravesha*, and He says " *Bahusyaam* *prajaayeya*", "Let Me become many", and He brings all the *chetana* and *achetana* into gross form, being the inner self of everything and is all pervading. He is only present in all these forms, because everything is His mode, being His *shareera*; so He is *Naikaroopa*, He has many forms. At the same time, in the state of cause, Causal state, where everything is merged unto Him, and is existing in an extremely subtle state, along with Him, without being distinguishable as a separate entity, united in Him - this is *Ekaroopa*. These are the state of Effect and the Causal state.

He is having avyakta also as His *shareera*. The *samashti, **vyasthi, mukta* - all are under His control only, His *shareera*. His *svaroopa* is *aanandamaya*, which is very well told in the *Shrutis* as " *Aanando brahmaa*", etc. You are one, existing in five different ways. This is like " *Bhoktaa bhogyam **preritaaram cha matvaa, sarvam proktam trividham brahmam etat*". In this *shloka*, five are told - *Bhootaatmaa, Indriyaatmaa, Pradhaanaatmaa, Aatmaa* and *Paramaatmaa*. You are existing in five different forms. In *bhoktaa*, *bhogyam, **preritaaram*, the non-sentient is combined together. Here, in this shloka, they are separated into five.

In order to grace the *upaasakaas*, You take form. The forms that You take, as deva, *manushya*, etc., are all out of Your own will.

If they cannot perceive You with a name and form, they cannot even meditate upon You, and will be stuck here forever.
