 ****Krishna* thought that if this *Kaalayavana* comes and destroys the *Yaadavaas* here, then *Jaraasandha* will easily come and attack us, and win over us. 



When *Jaraasandha* attacks from one side, and *Kaalayavana* from another side, anyone then can win over the *Yaadavaas*, *Krishna* thought. The one who wins will come and attack *Mathuraa*. When *Kaalayavana* comes and destroys the *Yaadavaas*, then *Jaraasandha* will easily come and defeat us. If by chance, *Jaraasandha* destroys us, then *Kaalayavana* will attack and win over *Mathuraa. **Krishna* thought like this.

Now, *Muchukunda's* story will start, that *Kaalayavana* has been killed, about how *Krishna* planned to kill *Kaalayavana*, which we see next.  [[246]] of 399 



www.sadagopan.org





We are studying Chapter 23 of *Amsha* 5, where the story of *Kaalayavana* being killed by *Muchukunda* is being studied. *Kaalayavana* attacks *Mathura*, and Krishna thinking that if *Kaalayavana* and *Jaraasandha* both are there, it will become a problem for them, and gets the *Dwaarakaa Puri* built. And shifts all the people from *Mathura Puri* to *Dwaaraakaa*, so that they are all very safe in the ocean. *Krishna* goes alone to *Mathura Puri*, and when He comes out of the city, *Kaalayavana* sees Him unarmed, and chases Him. *Paraasharar* says that even great yogis cannot catch *Krishna* with their minds, *Kaalayavana* is trying to catch Him. 



*Krishna* runs away as though scared, and enters a huge cave, which is very dark inside. There, *Kaalayavana* sees someone lying down, and thinks that it is *Krishna*, and kicks him with his foot. And it happens to be *Muchukunda* who had helped the gods, during the deva-asura war. They had given him a boon, and he had asked for long rest, as he was very tired, and wanted to take rest for a very long time. They also told him that if anyone disturbs him during his sleep, the moment he sees them, that person will be burnt then and there. When *Muchukunda* was sleeping there, *Kaalayavana* without knowing, kicked him and woke him up, and when *Muchukunda* saw him, *Kaalayavana* was burnt immediately. Thus, *Krishna* gets *Kaalayavana* killed.

I never saw an end to this.

They are all like water in a mirage, which cannot be used for anything, which does not exist. I understood all of them and accepted them like that, and they only increased my suffering.

They came to seek my help. There is no happiness which is permanent. Where is the happiness which is permanent?

That which is obtained from their own *karmaas*, the acts which they do, they go to various hells, and they suffer great sufferings there. Because they do not know their real nature, and they don't know Your nature properly. They do not have the knowledge about Your nature.

Being deluded by Your *maayaa, prakruti*, I am extremely immersed in the enjoyment of the sense objects. I am wandering inside a deep pit, which is made of arrogance of possession that everything is mine, O Supreme Lord.

Now, I am surrendering unto You, and You are my refuge now. You, who are immeasurable and incomparable, I have surrendered. There is nothing superior to You to be attained. Those who are suffering from the great heat of this *samsaara*, this *bhramaa*, I am desirous of You, who are of great *tejas*. I am desiring to attain You. I have surrendered unto You now.
