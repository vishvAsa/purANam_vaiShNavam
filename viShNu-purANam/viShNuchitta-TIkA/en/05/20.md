Having remembered all his previous births, and having known that *Krishna* is the Supreme Lord, *Vasudeva* is eulogizing *Krishna*. 



We are studying Chapter 20 of *Amsha* 5, where *Kamsa* has been killed by *Krishna*, and He prostrates to both *Vasudeva* and *Devaki*, His parents, and *Vasudeva* remembers his *poorva janma*, and knows that *Krishna* is none other than the Supreme Brahman, and is eulogizing Him, as "How can anyone say that You are a human? You are the creator of everything".
