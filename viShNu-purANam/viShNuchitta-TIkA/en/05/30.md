All the difference in the bodies that we see, which are having a *jeevaatman* inside. As per *Koorma **Puraana, purgala* means *jeeva*. But as per *Jainaas*, *purgala* is *paramaanu*, because it fills and flows.

This *prakruti* is Your *maayaa* only. Because of that, we forget *Brahma*, as we are covered by the *prakruti*. We don't realize the truth. And this *prakruti* causes extreme *moha*. The effect of *maaya* is the having the idea of *aatman* in that which is not *aatman*, thinking of the body itself as *aatman*. Those who have their knowledge covered by *prakruti*, are bound in this *prakruti*.

That which does not belong to one, people think that it belongs to them only. People think that what is not theirs, is theirs. This kind of knowledge which is present in the humans, this kind of *ahamkaara* and *mamakaara*, that "I am the doer", which is present in the human beings here, the bound selves, all these which are caused by *prakruti* which is the cause of *samsaara*, are Your own sport only.

All the gods starting with *Chaturmukha Brahma*, the *manushyaas*, the animals, are all covered by a huge swirl, which is *Vishnu maayaa*, which is *prakruti*, and are covered in great darkness.

Having worshipped You, what the people seek is the different things they desire. They do not ask for *samsaara kshaya*. They aspire only for meagre desires. They worship You and seek meagre things from You. But they do not think of escaping from *samsaara*. This is all because of *maayaa*, and this *maayaa* is Your only; it is also Your *shareera*, and You are only controlling it.

Instead of asking for *kalpavruksha* itself, they ask for loin cloth and for other clothes. These kind of meagre desires come for those who do not have good virtues, but who have only accumulated sins. This is all because of their own defects, because of transgressing of *shaastraas*, etc.

Next comes the description about how the *Paarijaata* tree will be taken, and the fight which ensues, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 30 of *Amsha* 5. In this, the *Paarijaata apaharana **prasanga*, where *Krishna*, after killing *Narakaasura*, comes to *devaloka*, and when they are going around all the wonderful gardens of the gods there, the *Paarijaata* tree, which is there most wonderfully, with bunches of flowers all over, and fragrance spreading many *yojanaas*. Earlier, *Shachee Devi* does not offer *Paarijaata* flower to *Satyabhaama*, thinking that she is a mere human, and does not deserve to be given that flower, that it is only meant for devaas. Seeing all this, *Satyabhaama* tells *Krishna* - "If You really like me so much as You say so many times, take this *Paarijaata* tree to our garden. I want to have it there". Then, all the people protecting that *Paarijaata* tree, warn her, and say that this is only meant for *Shachee Devi*, and *Indra* will not allow them to go free like that, and that they will be in trouble. But then, *Satyabhaama* is very arrogant and gives the message to *Shachee Devi*, and tells them to go and tell their lord *Indra* and also *Shachee Devi*, that *Satyabhaama* is telling like this. She says - "Being a mere human, I am taking it away, and if anyone has the powers, let them stop me. Go and tell *Shachee Devi* that I know her husband *Indra*, and being a human, I am taking it away. Let me see if anyone stops me".

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 30, Shloka 52: *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****इत्युक्ता * *****रज्ञक्षणो * *****गत्र्वा * *****शच्याः * *****प्रोचुयिथोहदतम् * | *****श्रुत्र्वा * *****चोत्साहयामास * *****शची * *****शक्रां * *****सुराथधपम् * *****॥ * *****५२ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - They go and tell the same thing what *Satyabhaama* told, to *Shachee*. Immediately, *Shachee Devi* tells *Indra* that he should go and stop them.

One who is the cause of all these worlds, everything is created from Him only, everything arises from Him. Everything is resorting Him only. He is the supporter of everything. If He is not there, they will not be there, nothing will exist, and everything will merge into Him. Such a person who is the Supreme Lord, who is the cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution, if I lose to Him, why should I be ashamed? He is the Supreme Lord, most powerful.

Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****सकिभुर्वन * *****इतत * | *****मूततिः * *****रूपम् * | *****अल्प * *****अल्प * *****सूक्ष्मा * *****अततसूक्ष्मतरा * | ***



He is the cause of all the worlds. All the worlds are His form only. He is the most subtle. Those who know everything that is there to know, only by such people He can be known. His greatness is known only by such people who know everything that is there to be known. Others cannot even know Him. That unborn, who is divine, *apraakruta*, who does not have a cause, who is the Lord, who is the eternal, such a Supreme Lord, who is always engaged in doing good for all the worlds, how can anyone even win over Him? Who is capable of winning over Him?
