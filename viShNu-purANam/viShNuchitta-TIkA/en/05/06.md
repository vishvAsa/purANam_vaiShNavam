 ***The river which was flowing in the town, started to overflow, and go beyond the banks, because of the heavy rains. It was as though the minds of the weak and evil minded people, or the suffering people, they suddenly find a lot of wealth, property, how their mind becomes so joyous, just like that, the rivers were overflowing beyond their banks. ***

 ***The moon was completely covered by the dark clouds. The moon did not shine at all. It was as though the good arguments of the wise people, when it is overtaken or thrown out by the arrogant arguments of the stupid people with loud voice. The moon was completely covered by clouds. 



Fools or stupid people are those who do not follow the *Vedaas*, those who do not believe in the validity of the *Vedaas*, orthose who interpret the *Vedaas* in a wrong way. Their arguments overtake the *vaidika vaada*, of the wise persons, it was like that. This is the similarity given there.

The *Indradhanush* was without any colours, or was unstrung. The bow of Indra was in the heavens, was as through a person who is an *aviveki*, who is given a very high position by a king. It was just like that. ***

 ***One who is having a bad conduct, or who does bad to others - towards him, how does one who have a good conduct, or one born in a good clan, how will he behave? A person with a good conduct, how he behaves with a person having a bad conduct - just like that, on the back of the clouds, the row of *chaataka* birds, storks, were all shining forth, behind the clouds, beautifully. 



*Durvrutta* is one who has done *apakaara. Kuleena* is one born in a good clan.

 ***The roads became covered with all the plants. One could not even see where there was a road, or not. Because plants were grown all over. It was as though the ignorant ones speak with one intention, and it gets conveyed in a different intention; where they want to say something and they say something else.  [[66]] of 399

Whatever they want to say, it conveys a different meaning. In the same way, the paths were all covered by plants and one could not make out which was a path, and which was not. This was not clearly noticeable.
