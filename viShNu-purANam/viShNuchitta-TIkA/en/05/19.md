This is not the right place to discuss about tattva, etc. Because I am really delayed and scared of *Kamsa* to whom I am subordinate. If I am delayed, he will be very angry. Though I perceived You directly with my eyes, I am not able to speak to You, I have to rush and get back to *Mathura*, being scared of *Kamsa*.
