 ****Sri Paraasharar* - There is a *paathaantara*, called *Jagaddhaatri*, which applies to *Durgaa. Jagaddhaatraa* means *Bhagavaan*. The God of gods, the *Sarveshvara, Bhagavaan*, whatever He said, as per that, the six children have to be brought and placed in *Devaki's* womb, and the seventh one *Shesha* has to be taken and placed with *Rohini*. Accordingly, *Yoga nidraa* carries out all of this. ***

 ***The seventh one was taken to *Rohini's garbha*, and then, for the good of all the three worlds, *Bhagavaan* entered into *Devaki's* womb.

So that when *Krishna* incarnates, then Krishna will be exchanged with *Durgaa* by *Vasudeva*. *Yoga nidraa* carried out the instructions given by the Lord.

She was radiant. Whoever saw her, their minds got disturbed, such was her *tejas*, once *Bhagavaan* entered into her womb.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 2, Shloka 6: *****अदृषटाः * *****पुरुर्षैः * *****स्त्रीलभः * *****देर्वक ां * *****देर्वतागणाः * | *****त्रर्र्भ्ाणाां * *****र्वपुर्षा * *****वर्वषणुां * *****तुषटुर्वुः * *****ताम् * *****अहतनिशम् * *****॥ * *****६ * *****॥ * ***All the hosts of *devataas* in the *svarga lok* a, unseen by men and women, in this world, they eulogized *Devaki* who was carrying Vishnu. Day and night they prayed to her. 





How the *devataas* praised *Devaki* is told here, as she was carrying *Bhagavaan* Himself in her womb. This *stuti* is eulogizing *Bhagavaan* only indirectly through *Devaki*, as she is carrying none other than *Sri Krishna* in her womb. *

 ****Devataas* - Before creation, during pralaya, that *prakruti*, You are only that. That which had all the sentients, *jeevaatmans* in it, before *srushti*, the *achit* and *chit* were all combined together, that *prakruti*, You are only that *prakruti*. Or, it can also be taken as *mahat*. From *moola* *prakruti, mahat* is created, then *ahamkaara*. So, *Brahma* can also be taken to mean *mahat*. You are the very primordial matter,  [[32]] of 399

In *Harivamsha*, it is told that *Aditi* is born as *Devaki*, and Surabhi is born as *Rohini*. And *Kaashyapa* as *Vasudeva*.
