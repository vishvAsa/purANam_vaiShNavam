 ****Sri Bhagavaan* said - Earlier, you had praised me, you had done *tapas*, and had asked Me for a boon, which was that you wanted Me to be born as your child. See Me as being born as your child. That prayer of yours has fructified today, has come to fruition today, Now, I am born in your womb. 



In *Svaayambhuva Manvantara*, they had done *tapas*, as *Prushni* and *Sutapa*. To them, *Bhagavaan* was born as *Prushnigarbha*. They had prayed that He should be born in three *janmaas*. The next *janma* was that of *Vaamana*, when *Prushni* and *Sutapa* were born as *Aditi* and *Sutapa*, *Bhagavaan* was born as their child *Vaamana*. Now, *Aditi* and *Kaashyapa* have become *Devaki* and *Vasudeva*, and *Bhagavaan* has incarnated as *Krishna*. This is told in *Srimad Bhaagavata*. Because *Vasudeva* and *Devaki* say that "Withdraw Your four arms", till the killing of *Kamsa, **Krishna* is seen with only two arms. But, in reality, He always had *chaturbhuja* only, but He had not revealed all the four arms. He had revealed only two *bhujas* till killing *Kamsa*. After that, He is seen with *chaturbhuja* only. This *chaturbhuja* is seen in *Naraka, Shishupaala, Pundraka* killings also.
