Don't feel bad because all your children were destined to die like that. They had some defect, and because of their *karmaas*, they were destined to be killed like that. ***

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 4, Shloka 17:  *****श्री * *****पराशरः * - *****इतत * *****आश्र्वास्य * *****वर्वमुक्त्र्वा * *****च * *****कांसः * *****तौ * *****पररशङ्क्रकतः * | *****अन्तगृिहां * *****द्वर्वजश्रेषठ * *****प्रवर्वर्वेश * *****ततः * *****स्र्वकम् * *****॥ * *****१७ * *****॥ * ****Sri Paraasharar* - Having told them like that, and still having doubts about who is born to kill him, he was always troubled in his mind, he entered into his house after that. 



This completes Chapter Four.

We just saw Chapter 4 of *Amsha* 5, where *Kamsa* recalls the words of *Durgaa* that the person who kills him is already born, so he calls all the *asuraas Pralamba, **Dhenuka, Keshi, Pootanaa*, and others, and tells them to be cautions and watch out, and says that he is not scared of Indra or *Hari*. He is so arrogant with his powers that nobody can do any harm to him. He says that even then, we have to be very careful and cautious, because the gods are always trying to kill him. Any child, if seen with extraordinary powers, just kill that child, he instructs them. Then he frees *Devaki* and *Vasudeva* and then retires. The story of *Krishna* continues now, the *Krishnaavataara*.
