"You *Yaadavaas* have all become arrogant, because we have made you sit along with us in the same seat, and also for eating and others. We have given you a lot of respect, and because of that, you have become arrogant". 



Whatever we gave out of love, we came and showed our respect, you did not receive it properly. You did not take it in the right sense. You have no respect for that. You are all lowly people compared to us. Even then, with love, we respected you, even though we should have actually disrespected you. Instead of that, we offered you same seat and food. We took you as equals to us. This you neglected. You did not see it as done out of love, but thought that we were scared and that is why we were offering this respect to you. You did not take it in the right way, and you people don't even deserve all these.

What is this disrespect that you are showing to me? They are wicked people, they don't have any powers, and they don't even deserve anything. They think that the rulership which came to the *Yaadavaas* started recently only, that it has not come as per our *paramparaa*. They are not respecting *Ugrasena's* orders, they want to reject it and transgress it.

*Ugrasena* is now controlling the *Sudharmaa*, and not Indra, because Indra has sent the *Sudharmaa* to *Ugrasena* himself. That is his greatness. Who are these *Kouravaas*, who are actually getting pleased with whatever is offered by the hundreds of human kings. Whereas *Ugrasena* is enjoying *Sudharmaa*, which is *saakshaat Indra's deva sabhaa*; that itself is owned by *Ugrasena*.
