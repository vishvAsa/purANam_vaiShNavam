The *gopaas* spoke a lot of things with Him very dearly, and all the *gopis* were pretending to be angry, out of love towards Him. Some of them were even jealous. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 5, Chapter 24, Shloka 12:  *****गोप्यः * *****पप्रच्चुरपरा * *****नागरीजनर्वल्िभम् * | *****कस्च्चदास्ते * *****सुखां * *****कृषणः * *****चिप्रेमिर्वात्मकः * *****॥ * *****१२ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****गोप्य * *****इतत * | *****अपराः * *****कृषणकान्ता * *****गोप्यः * *****पप्रच्चुः * | ***



Some other *gopis* who were in love with *Krishna*, asked Him thus, who is after the women of the city, and who is now very dear to them. "Is *Krishna* happy there, is He doing well? He has very little love, and that is also not constantly there, and keeps changing. Such *Krishna*, how is He doing?".

They asked *Balaraama* - "Whatever we were playing with Him, without knowing, we were all women of the village, we are not educated like those in the city, we don't know much, whatever we did with Him, we hope He is not making fun of all that in front of all the women folk of the city. That He is not respecting them more than us. His friendship does not last long at all".

One who used to follow our songs and prayers, does He remember us at all? Will He even come once to see His mother here?

Or, what is even the purpose of talking about Him? Let us talk about something else. He is not going to be with us, and we are not going to be with Him. What is the purpose in talking about Him? 



They are feeling very sad. We are going to spend time without Him. We will live without Him. He will spend time without us. It is just to pacify themselves that they are telling this.

He has left everyone - father, mother, brother, and relatives. We left everyone - father, mother, brother, husband and relatives - and went after Him. We deserted everyone in order to be with *Krishna*, and we ran after Him. He is the leader of those who don't remember anyone. *Krutajnya* is one who remembers good done to one. *Akrutajnya* is one who does not remember, Krishna is leader among them.

The moment they see *Balaraama* and remember *Krishna*, and tell all these things - whether He is coming, or will not come at all, and they keep calling *Balaraama* Himself as *Krishna, Daamodara*, and are laughing loudly, as though they are not in their minds at all. Their mind is totally captured by *Krishna*. 



They have surrendered their everything unto *Krishna*, and they cannot tolerate His separation. They are immediately remembering *Krishna*, and experiencing the bliss of union with Him here. One of the outcomes of that is this *nirveda, dukha*.
