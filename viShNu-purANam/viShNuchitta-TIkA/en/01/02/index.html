Briefly Paraasharar told the answers to Maitreyar’s questions in one *shloka *( shloka 31, of Amsha 1, Chapter 1). Now he is going to explain that in detail. This entire puraana is going to explain in detail the answer given by Paraasharar very briefly in one shloka. He starts the puraana with [[44]] these seven shlokaas, starting with Avikaaraaya, thereby offering namaskaara to his favourite devataa and one who is established in this puraana.">

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 1:</strong></em> <em><strong>Sri Paraashara uvaacha -</strong></em> <em><strong>Avikaaraaya shuddhaaya nityaaya paramaatmane |</strong></em> <em><strong>Sadaika roopa roopaaya vishnave sarva jishnave ||</strong></em> He does not have any <em>vikaara</em>, He is immutable, does not undergo any change.</p>
<p><em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s svaroopa</em> is explained wonderfully in the first seven <em>shlokaas</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Tat evam sankshepatah uktaanaam prati vachanaanaam vivaranatayaa<br>
avataaryamaanasya puraanasya aarambham avikaaraaya ityaadibhih<br>
saptabhih (navabhih) shlokaih puraana pratipaadya svaabhimata<br>
devataa namaskaara poorvakam pratijaaneete |</strong></em> In the beginning, <em>Paraasharar</em> offers obeisance to his <em>svaabhimata devataa</em>, the <em>Paramaatman</em>, who is his favourite God, and one who is established in the <em>Puraanaas, Mahaa Vishnu</em>, whose nature is going to be established in this <em>puraana</em>, about whom he is going to teach in detail. Briefly <em>Paraasharar</em> told the answers to <em>Maitreyar&rsquo;s</em> questions in one *shloka *( <em>shloka</em> 31, of <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 1). Now he is going to explain that in detail. This entire <em>puraana</em> is going to explain in detail the answer given by <em>Paraasharar</em> very briefly in one <em>shloka</em>. He starts the <em>puraana</em> with  [[44]] these seven <em>shlokaas</em>, starting with <em>Avikaaraaya</em>, thereby offering <em>namaskaara</em> to his favourite <em>devataa</em> and one who is established in this <em>puraana</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tatra kaaranatva abhidhaanatah prasaktam vikaaritvam nirasyati -<br>
avikaaraaya iti |</strong></em> The moment something is told to be a cause of something, the cause undergoes a change - we see like this in the world. All causes are assumed to be undergoing some modification. Is <em>Paramaatman</em> also like that, is the first question we get. This is refuted in the very first *shloka *- that which is told to be having <em>kaaranatva</em>, the change that ensues is being negated. He does not have any vikaara, that is HIS essential nature.</p>
<p><em><strong>Anena achetanaat vyaavruttih |</strong></em> By this, <em>Paramaatman</em> is different and distinct from the inert. Because all the <em>achetanaas</em> undergo change all the time, in <em>svaroopa</em> itself.</p>
<p><em>Achetanaa paraarthaa saa nithyaa satata vikriyaa. Achetana</em> is also eternal, but undergoes change in essential nature all the time. It is <em>achetanaa</em>, not <em>jnyaana aashraya</em>. It is inert, and does not have knowership. It is <em>paraarthaa</em>, exists for something else. <em>Chetana</em> uses it for body, <em>indriyaas</em>, etc. It is eternal, in <em>avyakta</em> form. It is also a reality in our <em>siddhaanta</em>, along with <em>chit</em> and <em>eeshvara</em>.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>Paramaatman</em> is <em>avikaari</em>, so <em>Paramaatman</em> is distinct and different from <em>achetana</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>* Na jaayate mriyate vaa ityaadi shruteh kshetrajnyasya api samaanam<br>
avikaaritvam iti tat vyaavruttim aaha - shuddhaaya iti |</strong></em>  [[45]] Now, if <em>Paramaatman</em> is different from <em>achetana</em>, by telling as <em>avikaari</em>, even <em>chetana</em> is also <em>avikaari</em>, as it is told that he is not born, or does not die, does not undergo any change; <em>jeevaatman</em> in his essential nature is <em>jnyaana svaroopa. Kshetrajnya</em> who is <em>jeevaatman</em> is also equally <em>avikaari</em>. How is <em>Paramaatman</em> different from <em>jeevaatman? Paramaatman</em> is <em>shuddha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shuddhih klesha karma aadi raahityam; * ashuddhaah te samastaastu iti<br>
hi vakshyate |</strong></em> <em>Jeevaatman</em> has got <em>karma, ajnyaana</em>. These do not exist for *Paramaatman *- this is told as <em>shuddhaaya</em>. In <em>Vishnu Puraana</em> itself, it is going to be told that <em>deva, manushya</em> are *karma yonayah *- born due to karma, and so are all said to be <em>ashuddha</em>; they undergo grief, sorrow, sufferings. <em>Paramaatman</em> is said to be <em>shuddha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Eedrushi shuddhih muktasya api asti iti tat vvyaavruttim aaha -<br>
nityaaya iti |</strong></em> By <em>shuddhaaya, Paramaatman</em> is different and distinct from <em>jeevaatman</em>, because <em>jeevaatmans</em> are all <em>ashuddhaas</em>; they are <em>baddha jeevaas</em> referred to here. So, <em>Paramaatman</em> is different from <em>baddha jeevaas</em>. This kind of <em>shuddhi</em> is there for <em>muktaas</em> also, because they have escaped from <em>samsaara</em>, liberated from <em>samsaara</em>; the <em>muktaas</em> do not have *klesha, *<em>karma</em>. In order to say that <em>Paramaatman</em> is different from <em>muktaas</em>, the next word <em>nityaaya</em> is told. <em>Paramaatman</em> is eternally *shuddha. *<em>Muktaas</em> were at one point of time <em>baddhaas</em> in <em>samsaara</em>; and after that got liberated; they are not eternally <em>shuddhaas</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shuddhatva akaarena nityaaya |</strong></em> <em>Paramaatman</em> is eternally <em>shuddha</em>.</p>
<p>[[46]] <em><strong>Avikaaritva shuddhatva nitya shuddhatva aadeeni nitya soorinaam api<br>
saadhaaranaani iti ata aaha - paramaatmana iti |</strong></em> There is one more category of <em>aatmans</em>, who are <em>nityaas</em>. They are *avikaari, *<em>shuddha</em>, and also <em>nitya shuddha</em>, because they are called <em>nitya sooris</em>, eternally not connected with <em>samsaara</em>. So, *avikaaraaya, shuddhaaya, **nityaaya *- apply to even <em>nitya sooris</em>, so how is <em>Paramaatman</em> different. The word <em>Paramaatman</em> itself shows that He is different from <em>nitya sooris</em> also.</p>
<p><em><strong>Paro yasmaat naasti sah paramah, aparaadheenah; niyantrutayaa<br>
sarvasya vyaapanaat aatmaa, nitya soorayah tena paravantah |</strong></em> There is no one who is superior to <em>Paramaatman</em>. He is not under the control of anyone else, whereas <em>nityaas</em> are under the control of <em>Paramaatman</em>. He pervades everything, being the controller, this is why He is said to be <em>aatmaa. Nitya sooris</em> are also controlled by Him. he does not have any other controller.</p>
<p><em><strong>Atah pada chatushtayena pradhaanaadi achetana brahma sanaka aadi<br>
bhaavanaa yukta kshetrajnya mukta nitya sooribhyoh vyaavruttam<br>
parama svaroopam shodhitam |</strong></em> By these four words - *avikaaraaya, shuddhaaya, nityaaya, paramaatmane *- what is established is that <em>Paramaatma svaroopa</em> is different and distinct from (i) <em>pradhaana</em> and all such <em>achetanaas (kaala, mahat, ahamkaara</em>, etc.), (ii) all the <em>jeevaatmans (Brahma, Sanaka</em>, etc.) who are all *bhaavanaa *<em>yukta</em>*, (iii) <em>mukta</em>, the liberated souls, (iv) <em>nitya sooris</em>, the eternal liberated ones. The nature of <em>Paramaatman</em> as different and distinct from all these, is established by these four words.</p>
<p>* There are three kinds of <em>bhaavana</em>, they are *bhaavanaa traya - karma *<em>bhaavanaa, brahma bhaavanaa</em> and <em>ubhaya bhaavanaa. Brahmabhaavanaa</em> is of the form of <em>upaasanaatmaka jnyaana, karma bhaavana</em> is <em>karma anushthaana</em>. <em>Sanaka</em> and other have <em>brahmabhaavanaa</em>  [[47]] <em>Hiranyagarbha</em> and others have <em>ubhaya bhaavana</em> (some times <em>karma</em> and sometimes <em>brahma bhaavanaa</em>). All other <em>devas</em> and <em>manushyas</em> – have <em>karma bhaavanaa</em>. The explanation regarding <em>mumukshus</em> ( <em>manushyas</em> or <em>devas</em>) – is that they are also having <em>karma bhaavanaa</em> only as they think that ‘ <em>upaasane</em>’ is being done by them only ( <em>svakeeyata buddhi</em>). Hence it is not considered <em>brahma bhaavana</em> (because *Vishnu *<em>Puraana shlokas</em> are clearly stating such). We will come across this in 6th A <em>msha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Atha jnyaana shakti aadivat asaadhaaranam tadvat eva sarva<br>
vilakshanam sva anuroopam jyotirmayam * aaditya varnam *<br>
hiranmayah purusho drushyate * vidyutah purushaadadhi * iti upanishat<br>
siddham svaroopam aaha - sadaika roopa roopaaya iti |</strong></em> <em>Sadaika roopa roopaaya &hellip;</em> - this part of the <em>shloka</em> is establishing the nature of <em>Paramaatman</em> which is established in the Upanishads as <em>jyotirmayam</em>, incomparable brilliance, lustre - *Aaditya varnam tamasah parastaat *- compared to *Aaditya, Hiranmayah purusho drushyate *- brilliance is compared to that of gold, *Vidyutah purushaadadhi *- lightning, etc - which is befitting His own <em>svaroopa</em>, different and distinct from everything else other than Himself, which is extraordinary or unique to <em>Paramaatman</em>, just like <em>jnyaana shakti</em>, etc. - this form of <em>Paramaatman</em> is told as *sadaika roopa *<em>roopaaya</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prathamo roopa shabdah svabhaava vaachee |</strong></em> The first <em>roopa shabda</em> is telling about <em>svabhaava</em>. Always of the same form, immutable. This is told as <em>saidaika roopa</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Athavaa sadaika roopam tulya prakaaram, heya pratyaneekatayaa<br>
kalyaana ekataanatatayaa cha svaroopa tulyam |</strong></em> Or <em>sadaika roopa</em> can also be interpreted as always of same form of nature - which is opposed to anything defiling, and abode to only all auspicious qualities. In whatever form He exists, these two are are always present.</p>
<p>[[48]] <em><strong>Dviteeyo roopa shabdo vigraha vaachee |</strong></em> The second <em>roopa shabda</em> is telling that He has eternal *shubhaashraya, divya *<em>mangala vigraha</em>. He has a form, an eternal auspicious form, immutable all the time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Atha sarva vyaapti lakshanam aishwaram gunam khyaapayan<br>
visheshyam nirdishati vishnave iti |</strong></em> The word <em>vishnave</em> is telling about His quality, of the form of ruling everything, pervading everything, <em>Bhagavaan</em> pervading everything controls everything from inside and outside.</p>
<p><em>Aishwara</em> is about ruling everything. <em>Eeshitavya</em> is what is ruled. He is not like the things of this world who can only rule externally.</p>
<p><em>Vishu vyaaptou</em> is the <em>dhaatu</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chit achit vyaaptyaa prasaktam dosham pariharati sarva jishnave iti |</strong></em> The moment <em>vishnave</em> is said, that He is pervading and controlling everything, all the defects of that <em>chetana</em> and *achetana *- do they ensue to <em>Paramaatman</em>? This is negated by the word <em>sarva jishnave</em>. He is untainted by any of the defects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jayo hi parasya sva vashe sthaapanam |</strong></em> Winning means establishing whatever is won over, establishing it under ones control. Controlling everything, winning over everything is also <em>svaabhaavika</em>.</p>
<p>[[49]] <em><strong>Taaccheelya pratyayena vyaapti jayou svaabhaavikou iti darshayati |</strong></em> The word Vishnu, according to <em>vyaakarana</em> is told as <em>Taaccheelya</em>, means one who pervades everything, it is the nature itself. This becomes <em>svaabhaavika</em>.</p>
<p>Pervading everything and controlling everything - both these are natural to <em>Paramaatman</em>.</p>
<p><em>Shloka</em> 1 is a very important <em>shloka</em>, which establishes <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s</em> unique nature and attributes that He is different and distinct from everything else; He controls everything pervading from inside - <em>antarvyaapti</em>. He has a *divya *<em>mangala vigraha</em>, which is most lustrous, unchanging all the time. He is of the nature of being opposed to anything defiling, being abode to only auspicious qualities. This establishes the nature of Brahman in the most wonderful way.</p>

<p><em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s svaroopa</em> is taught up to these seven <em>shlokaas</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Question</strong></em>: Why <em>Bhagavaan</em> wanted to create? <em>Answer</em>: This is also asked in the <em>Brahma Sutras</em>. The answer given by <em>Baadaraayana</em> is <em><strong>Lokavat tu leelaa kaivalyam</strong></em>. It is His sport. Someone has grief, someone has happiness. Someone is enjoying, someone is suffering. Someone has knowledge, someone has ignorance. Why should <em>Paramaatman</em> create all this? It is said to be His sport. He is impartial. He does not have <em>vaishamya</em> and <em>nairghrunya</em>. He does not want someone to suffer. He does not have impartiality or cruelty. The suffering happens because of <em>chetana&rsquo;s karma</em>; they have to experience the results of that; if they do not experience, there will be <em>dosha</em> of partiality on the part  [[51]] of <em>Paramaatman</em>. A king, if he does not punish a criminal, will become partial; he has to enforce the law. <em>Leelaa</em> is sport for Him, and is ultimately <em>dayaa</em>, because He wants <em>jeevaatmans</em> to liberate themselves from <em>samsaara</em>. He gives them the mind, thinking power, *kriyaa shakti, chit *<em>shakti</em>, shows the <em>aachaaryaas</em>, teaches the <em>shaastra</em>, makes one to go in the right way, and they have to uplift themselves; if they don&rsquo;t do, they have to suffer the <em>karma</em>.</p>
<p>We had studied the <em>Shloka</em> 1, of <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 2, where the *Paramaatma *<em>svaroopa</em> is established wonderfully, where He is different and distinct from everything else - <em>achetana, baddha, mukta</em> and <em>nitya</em>. Being the <em>antaryaami</em> of everything, He is the inner controller. He has a wonderful divine auspicious form, which is also eternal, and He pervades everything and rules over everything. All of this was established with various <em>Shruti</em> and <em>Smruti pramaanaas</em>.</p>
<p>Continuing further, <em>Bhagavat svaroopa</em> is established again, in various ways.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 2:</strong></em> <em><strong>Namo hiranya garbhaaya haraye shankaraaya cha |</strong></em> <em><strong>Vaasudevaaya taaraaya sarga sthiti antakaarine ||</strong></em> I offer <em>pramaanams</em> to <em>Hiranya Garbha, Hari</em> and <em>Shankara</em>, and also <em>Vaasudeva</em>, who makes everyone cross over <em>samsaara</em> and is the cause of creation, sustenance and *pralaya *(dissolution).</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary</strong></em> While <em>Bhagavat svaroopa</em> is being established, everything is directed towards <em>Bhagavaan</em>. But here, we see <em>namaskaarams</em> being done to <em>Hiranya</em> [[52]] <em>Garbha</em> and <em>Shankara</em>. What is its meaning? How is <em>Bhagavat svaroopa</em> known from this? This is explained in the <em>vyaakhyaana</em>. <em><strong>Brahma shivayoh tat vibhootitvam aaha - namo hiranyagarbhaaya iti |</strong></em> The aspect that <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and <em>Rudra</em> are also <em>vibhooti</em> of <em>Paramaatman, (vibhooti</em> means *aishwarya, *<em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> glory, being ruled over by him) - this is told by *Namo Hiranya *<em>Garbhaaya iti</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sva avataara chaturmukha rudra roopena hi srushti aadi kartrutvam |</strong></em> <em>Brahma, Vishnu</em> and <em>Maheshwara</em>, who are the three <em>devataas</em>, responsible for <em>srushti, sthiti</em> and <em>pralaya; sva avataara</em> is <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> own <em>avataara</em>, along with <em>Brahma</em> and *Rudra *- in these three forms; He being the <em>antaryaami</em> of <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, makes him do the creation; being the <em>antaryaami</em> of <em>Rudra</em>, He does dissolution in the form of <em>Rudra</em>; and <em>Vishnu</em> is His own <em>avataara</em>, He Himself stays as <em>Hari</em>; in the forms of <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and <em>Rudra</em>, He does <em>srushti</em> and <em>pralaya</em> being their <em>antaryaami</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Taaraaya - samsaara uttaarakaaya, moksha pradaaya |</strong></em> One who makes everyone cross over <em>samsaara</em>, and in getting liberated from <em>samsaara</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vaasudevaaya - vaasudeva roopena moksha pradatvam |</strong></em> <em>Vaasudeva</em> is <em>Para Vaasudeva; Bhagavaan</em> is present as *Para *<em>Vaasudeva</em> in <em>Parama Padam; moksha pradatva</em> is told for Him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hari shabde satyapi vaasudeva shabdo hareh avataaratva<br>
jnyaapanaarthah |</strong></em>  [[53]] When <em>Hari</em> is already told, why is <em>Vaasudeva</em> being told again; <em>Hari</em> is <em>avataara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em> only; <em>Para Vaasudeva</em> Himself incarnates or manifests as <em>Hari</em>, to give equal status to <em>Brahma</em> and <em>Shiva</em> in <em>srushti</em> and <em>pralaya</em>, as they are His own <em>vibhootis</em>; He only has given them the powers to do the powers; He stays with them to give them the status.</p>

<p><em><strong>&hellip; Brahmaanam shitikantham cha yaah cha anyaa devataah smrutaah |<br>
Pratibuddhaa na sevante yasmaat parimitam phalam | &hellip;</strong></em> Those who are desirous of attaining <em>moksha</em>, they are called <em>pratibuddhaas</em>; they do not worship or surrender unto <em>Chaturmukha Brahma, Rudra</em> or any other <em>devataa</em> who is told like <em>Varuna</em>, Indra, etc. The reason is that the benefits gained by worshipping those deities is very limited as they are all in the <em>prakruti mandala</em> only; and whatever they can give is limited to their capacities, as they are <em>kshetrajnyaas</em> only; none of them can give <em>moksha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>* Antavat tu phalam teshaam * ityaadibhih bhagavata eva moksha<br>

<p><em>Shloka</em> 2 establishes the offering of <em>pranaamams</em> to <em>Bhagavaan</em>, who is in the form of <em>Hari</em> Himself, and His <em>vibhootis</em>, who are *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> and <em>Rudra</em>, He being their <em>antaryaami</em>, does all their works, and <em>Vaasudeva</em> who bestows <em>moksha</em>, and is the cause of *srushti, *<em>sthiti</em> and <em>laya</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Achit prasangaat kaala roopatvam aaha - sarga sthiti iti |</strong></em> Here, <em>kaala svaroopa</em> is being told, <em>Bhagavaan</em> being of the <em>svaroopa</em> of <em>kaala</em>.</p>
<p>[[56]] <em><strong>Jagat sarga aadi moola bhooto hi kaalah, * na kaalena vinaa srushti<br>

Time is always known with respect to objects. An object comes into existence at some time, it stays for some time, undergoes change, and gets destroyed at some point of time. For all these, <em>kaala</em> is said to be the root cause. Without <em>kaala</em>, <em>Brahma</em> cannot create, because creation is done at a particular time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jaganmayah - unmesha nimesha kalaa unmaana soorya gamana aadinaa<br>
padaartha avacchedaka svaroopah |</strong></em> Here, <em>Bhagavat svaroopa</em> is told in the form of <em>kaala</em> itself. Time can be felt in aspects such as opening the eyes, closing the eyes, divisions of time like <em>kalaa muhoortha kaashthaa paksha maasa samvatsara</em>, a particular measure called <em>unmaana</em>, movement of the Sun in the morning, afternoon, evening - everything is bound by time, and <em>Paramaatman</em> only is told as that <em>svaroopa</em>. He binds everything with respect to time. He is only responsible for the rising of the Sun at a particular time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Paramaatmane - akaala vashyaaya |</strong></em> <em>Paramaatman</em> is not controlled by time. <em>Kaala</em> is under the control of <em>Paramaatman</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>* Kaalah pachati bhootaani sarvaani eva sahaatmanaa | Kaalah pakvo<br>

In <em>Paramapada</em>, <em>kaala</em> does not control anything; everything is eternal there, and there is no change; <em>kaala</em> exists but does not control anything in <em>Paramapada</em>. In <em>prakruti mandala, kaala</em> controls everything. Even <em>Brahma&rsquo;s</em> time is limited by a particular number of <em>kalpaas</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Vishvasya prakruti parinaamasya jeeva karma nimittatvena tat<br>

<p>We cannot tell Him through <em>roopa, varna</em>. We cannot also tell Him with the six <em>bhaava vikaaraas</em>. How can we ever address Him. Is it possible to tell Him?</p>

<p><em><strong>Agni jala aadibhih nabha iva sarva gato api tadgata doshaih<br>

He shines forth untouched by any defects, He is existing everywhere. Just like space pervades everything, He pervades water, fire, everything. The defects of water, fire, space do not touch space. In the same way, <em>Paramaatman</em> pervades everything, untouched by the defects of all the objects. He shines forth like that.</p>
<p><em>Bhagavad svaroopa</em> is being explained in a most wonderful way by <em>Paraasharar</em>. All the <em>achetanaas</em>, and <em>samashti kshetrajnyaas</em> which are seen here, all <em>drushya padaarthaas</em>, and <em>kaala</em>, are <em>Brahman</em> only, are all <em>shareera</em> of <em>Parabrahman. Paramaatma svaroopa</em> is told in terms of all the <em>tattvaas</em>, and the nature of these <em>tattvaas</em> are also explained. These are controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>, and He is the <em>antaryaami</em> of everything, everything being His <em>prakaara</em>, His mode, being His <em>shareera</em>. He is only existing as everything. This is what we see in the <em>Shrutis</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paramaatman</em>, is <em>Vaasudeva</em>, the <em>devataa vishesha.

Everything is residing in Him, and He resides in everything. He shines forth, and He is <em>deva.

Only because of His brilliance, everything else shines forth. He is <em>Vaasudeva</em>, the <em>devataa vishesha</em>, the Supreme Brahman, He is without any *shat bhaava *<em>vikaara</em>, He is <em>ekaroopa</em> all the time, He has a <em>divya mangala vigraha</em>.</p>

He gives the <em>chetanaas</em> an opportunity to act, think, understand, and uplift themselves. If <em>Paramaatman</em> does not enter, and does not do <em>anupravesha</em>, does not do differentiation into name and form, there will be no <em>vastu</em> at all.

[[72]] Everything is His <em>prakaara</em>, mode, and He is the *prakaari. *<em>Chit</em> and <em>achit</em> both are His modes. Every name and form denotes <em>Paramaatman</em> in the ultimate sense - this is called *aparyavasaana *<em>vrutti</em>. Why we don&rsquo;t feel like this, is because of our lack of knowledge, we limit the connotation of name and form to that <em>chetana</em> only. We don&rsquo;t experience the depth of the complete connotation of the words. All the <em>chetanaas</em> in <em>samashti, vyashti</em> or in any state, are all modes of <em>Paramaatman</em>, and become <em>vastu</em> because of <em>Paramaatman</em> only.

It is not in the <em>svaroopa</em>. If it was <em>svaroopa</em>, only one will exist, and second one cannot exist. <em>Taadaatmya</em> is not by <em>svaroopa</em> but through *shareera aatma bhaava. *<em>Chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em> exist, <em>Paramaatman</em> also exists; they both exist inseparably all the time, <em>Paramaatman</em> being the controller and support all the time, <em>chetanaas</em> and <em>achetanaas</em> being the controlled and supported, they are independent entities always associated with <em>Paramaatman</em> inseparably; without <em>Paramaatman</em> being there, they cannot even exist; their <em>sthiti, pravrutti</em> is controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>. This existence of <em>Paramaatman</em> in all these forms - this tree is <em>Paramaatman</em>, this book is <em>Paramaatman</em>, this table is *Paramaatman *- this oneness is by <em>shareera aatma bhaava</em>. All these are <em>shareera</em> to *Paramaatman. *<em>Paramaatman</em> exists as inner controller. This is established in the <em>Shrutis</em>, as in *Yasya aatmaa shareeram. Yah pruthivyaam tishtan, yah pruthivyaam **antarah, yam pruthivi na veda, yasya pruthivi shareeram, yah pruthivim *<em>antaro yamayati</em>, &hellip; says <em>Yaajnyavalkya</em>. Finally, he says, *yah aatmani **tishthan, aatmano antarah, yam aatmaa na veda, yasya aatmaa shareeram, *<em>yah aatmaanam antaro yamayati, sa te aatmaa antaryaami amrutah</em>. Even <em>jeevaatmans</em> are also His <em>shareera. Pruthivi, ap</em>, etc. are all His <em>shareera</em>. He exists in everything, controlling from inside. None of them know that He is existing there. He is all the time present in everything. This is told in the <em>Shruti</em> itself.</p>
<p>Otherwise what is the defect that comes. <em>Paramaatman</em> is of the nature of <em>heya pratyaneeka kalyaana gunaashraya</em>. His nature is opposed to everything that is evil, and He is abode to only auspicious qualities. There are two objects we see - <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana. Achetana</em> has got the defect of *vikaara *- it undergoes change in its very essential nature itself; its <em>svaroopa</em> itself goes on changing. For <em>jeevaatmans</em>, there is *apurushaartha *- contraction and expansion in their *dharma bhoota *<em>jnyaana</em>. For these kind of objects which have these defects, if <em>Paramaatman</em> is said to be one with these, will not the defects of these objects also ensue to <em>Paramaatman</em>? This doubt is removed by the *shruti *<em>pramaana, yasya aatmaa shareeram</em>.  [[74]]</p>
<p>In this <em>shloka</em>, the word <em>roopam</em> is <em>paryaaya pada</em> for <em>shareera</em>. This is explained clearly by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> in <em>Vedaartha Sangraha</em>, and also by *Sri *<em>Sudarshana Suri</em> in the <em>vyaakhyaana. Shrutis</em> and <em>smrutis</em> use many words which are <em>paryaaya padaas</em> for *shareera. Tanu, vapu, shakti, amsha, kaaya, **roopa *- are all used for <em>shareera</em>. There are three relationships - *aadhaara *<em>aadheya, niyaamaka niyaamya, sheshi shesha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Purushasya kartrutva bhoktrutva chetanatva aadinaa prakrutim iti<br>
praadhaanyat prathamyam |</strong></em> Compared to <em>prakruti, purusha</em> is superior because <em>Purusha</em> has *kartrutva *(agency), *bhoktrutva *(enjoyership), *chetanat**va *(He has <em>jnyaana aashraya</em>, He is knower).</p>

At the same time, we say that Brahman is without any defect and is abode to all auspicious qualities. If we see <em>Brahman</em> in all objects here, how do we know that <em>Brahman</em> has this <em>shuddha svaroopa</em> also.</p>

This is also explained by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> in *Vedaartha Sangraha. Parama *<em>Pada</em> has got three meanings (i) It is the <em>svaroopa</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, (ii) <em>jeevaatma svaroopa</em>, because that is also something which is attained, (iii) <em>Sri Vaikuntha</em>, where <em>Paramaatman</em> is present, and the <em>nitya sooris</em> are all there. Here, it is the form which is attained in <em>Vaikuntha</em>. Compared to <em>pradhaana, purusha, vyakta, kaala</em>, it is different and distinct. This is where the <em>shuddha roopa</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em> is present, and the *nitya *<em>sooris</em> are seeing all the time, *sadaa pashyanti soorayah. Bhagavaan&rsquo;s divya *<em>roopa</em> which exists in <em>Sri Vaikuntha</em>, said to be <em>Parama Pada</em> here, is <em>shuddha</em>, does not have the <em>vikaara</em> and <em>ajnyaana</em> which is present in <em>pradhaana, purusha, vyakta, kaala</em> which have a form. He is different and distinct from all these. The doubt raised is thus cleared.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jagat upaadaana bhootasya brahmanah katham vikaaraadi apraapti iti<br>

How can there be not the defect of modification or change in <em>Brahman</em>? This is the next doubt. This is answered here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pradhaana purusha vyakta kaalaa roopaani pravibhaagashah -<br>

Without getting mixed up with each other, they become the cause of <em>sthiti</em>, etc., being seen by the eyes, being known when they manifest, and their presence itself.</p>
<p>[[77]] When we plant a seed, after some time, we can say that a tree has come into existence, and we can see that it is a tree. Every object, every entity exists here without any <em>saankarya</em>. The cause of their forms is their own bodies, and not <em>Paramaatman.

These two being the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, the change is in the <em>shareera</em>, and not in the <em>Paramaatman</em> Himself, though He becomes the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>.</p>

<p>Why should <em>Paramaatman</em> do the <em>srushti</em>?

How can we say that He is the <em>sarva kaarana</em>? This is told in this <em>shloka</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vyaktaadeenaam tat adheena svaroopa sthiti pravruttitvena tat<br>
shareeratvaat tat vishishtasya vishnoh kaaranatvam na anupapannam |</strong></em> Though there is a modification in the <em>shareera</em> only, how can it change without <em>Paramaatman</em> being there? Everything is controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>. The very existence of these <em>chetana achetanaas</em>, their functioning, and their essential nature, everything is under the control of <em>Paramaatman</em>. In this way, they become the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, and <em>Paramaatman</em> who is qualified by these becomes the cause. This is not unreasonable.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vyaktam vishnuh iti aadi | Vyakta aadi shareerako vishnuh iti arthah |</strong></em> <em>Vishnu</em> is only what is manifested, the unmanifest is also <em>Vishnu</em>, <em>purusha</em> is also <em>Vishnu, kaala</em> is also <em>Vishnu</em>, the meaning is *vyakta shareerakah **vishnuh, avyakta shareerakah vishnuh, purusha shareerakah vishnuh, kaala *<em>shareerakah vishnuh</em>.

<p><em>Saamaanaadhikaranya</em> has been explained as *bhinaa pravrutti nimittaanaam *<em>shabdaanaam ekasmin arthe vruttih saamaanaadhikaranyam</em>. If two words which are in the same <em>vibhakti</em> tell the different aspects of the same object, this is <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em>. The object which is qualified by these characteristics is one only. The identity is not in the object and attribute, but the two objects which are qualified by two different aspects, for example, <em>jagat kaarana vishnuh</em>, and <em>vyakta shareeraka vishnuh</em>, these are in <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em>. The <em>vyakta</em> which is <em>brahmaatmaka</em>, having <em>Brahman</em> as the inner controller, and <em>Vishnu</em> who is the *jagat *<em>kaarana</em>, there is <em>saamaanaadhikaranya. Vishnu</em> is one only in both. It is not between <em>Vishnu</em> and <em>vyakta</em> that the <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em> is to be taken.  [[79]]</p>

<p><em>Lokavat tu leelaa kaivalyam. Leelaa eva kaaranam</em>. This is explained by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em>. A <em>saarvabhouma</em>, ruler who has got everything, also engages in sport, just for entertainment. Like this, it is not unreasonable for <em>Paramaatman</em> to do <em>srushti</em>, as <em>leelaa. Leelaa</em> is also explained as *dayaa *<em>kaarya</em>, as all <em>chetanaas</em> are lying as <em>achetana</em>, and if <em>srushti</em> does not happen, they cannot uplift themselves. Out of compassion, <em>Paramaatman</em> does <em>srushti</em>.</p>

There are others like <em>Saankhya</em> by <em>Kapila</em> which are opposed to what is told in the <em>Shrutis</em>, these are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The name of <em>Kapila</em> comes in the <em>Shrutis</em>, and whatever is told by him has to be accepted, is the objection. This objection is removed by *Brahma Sutra *<em>kaarar, Baadaraayanar</em>, that <em>Saankhya Smruti</em> has a lot of things which are  [[81]] opposed to what is taught in the <em>Shrutis</em>. One of them is that <em>pradhaana</em> is <em>abrahmaatmaka</em>; they do not accept <em>Brahman</em>; they have only <em>purusha</em> and <em>prakruti</em>; creation happens when the <em>pradhaana</em> modifies itself; it is <em>abrahmaatmaka</em> they say, and it acts by itself; this is not acceptable and is not as per what is told in the <em>Shrutis</em>.</p>
<p><em>Sat shabdavaachya brahma</em> is told. <em>Asat shabdavaachya</em> is also told, which means that <em>naama roopa vyaakarana</em> was not there. When nothing was differentiated into name and form, it is called as <em>asat</em>. This entire universe of <em>chetanaas, achetanaas</em> was existing as <em>sat shabda vaachya</em>, as *sookshma *<em>chit achit vishishta Paramaatman</em>, before <em>srushti</em>.

<p>These <em>shlokaas</em> are <em>pradhaana pratipaadaka shlokaas</em>. We shall take them up in the next class.</p>
<p><em><strong>Question</strong></em>: Please explain the terms <em>mahat</em> and <em>prakruti</em>. <em><strong>Answer</strong></em>: <em>Prakruti</em> is also told as <em>avyakta</em> or <em>pradhaana</em>, which is primordial matter, which is the unmanifest state of matter, at the time of <em>pralaya</em>. During <em>srushti, Paramaatman</em> being the <em>antaryaami</em>, makes it to undergo change, and a part of it undergoes change. It is <em>trigunaatmaka</em>. It undergoes change and becomes a new entity called *mahat *- this is also an inert <em>tattva</em>, unseen, unmanifest. <em>Paramaatman</em> who is <em>antaryaami</em> of <em>mahat</em>, makes it to undergo change, and it becomes <em>ahamkaara</em>. There are three *ahamkaaraas - *<em>saatvika, raajasa, taamasa</em>. From the <em>saatvika</em> and <em>raajasa ahamkaaraas</em>, eleven <em>indriyaas</em> are created. From the <em>raajasa</em> and *taamasa ahamkaara, *<em>pancha tanmaatraas</em> and <em>pancha bhootaas</em> are created. Then <em>pancheekarana</em> happens.</p>
<p>We were studying the nature of <em>prakruti</em> and <em>purusha</em>, that existed before <em>srushti</em>, at the end of <em>pralaya</em>. In order to teach about *srushti, *<em>Paraasharar</em> tells about the <em>svaroopa</em> of <em>pradhaana</em> and <em>purusha</em> and others, at the time of the end of the <em>pralaya</em>, before <em>srushti</em>. Then he will start  [[84]] telling about <em>srushti</em>. While telling this, he tells that everything is <em>Paramaatman</em> only, everything is <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s shareera</em>; the change that happens is only in the <em>shareera</em> and not in the <em>Paramaatman</em>, who is inseparably associated, and is immutable. If He does not undergo any change, if the change is only in the <em>shareera</em> which is <em>chetana</em> and *achetana, *<em>(svaroopa vikaara</em> in the <em>achetana</em> and <em>svabhaava vikaara</em> in the <em>chetana</em> in the <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>), how can <em>Paramaatman</em> be called the cause of creation? It is because the very existence, sustenance and functioning of these <em>chetanaas</em> and <em>achetanaas</em>, is controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>, and they are all inseparably associated with Him. As a qualified entity, He can also be called as the cause - He is the main cause. Creation is a mere sport for Him, <em>Kreedato baalakakasyeva cheshtaam tasya nishaamaya</em>, just like a boy is playing. <em>Kreedaa eva prayojanam iti arthah</em>.</p>
<p><em>Avyakta</em>, which is called as <em>pradhaana</em> by <em>Manu</em> and other <em>rishis</em>, is the cause. It is <em>prakruti</em>, very subtle, <em>sookshma, nitya</em>, eternal. It is not an effect; it is the cause of <em>mahat, ahamkaara</em>; it is an eternal entity, always existing. There is no vibration - <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em> are all equal in proportion at the time of <em>pralaya</em>. It is <em>triguna</em>, has three qualities. *Shabda, *<em>sparsha</em>, etc. are not there at the time of <em>pralaya</em>, and are manifested at the time of <em>vyashti srushti</em>, when the division happens into name and form.</p>
<p><em>Veda vaadis</em>, establish reality only based on what is taught in the <em>shrutis</em>. <em>Brahma vaadis</em> accept that <em>Brahman</em> is only the <em>kaarana</em>, the cause.</p>
<p>Two <em>shlokaas</em> about <em>pradhaana</em> are well known.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shlokaas 23, 24:</strong></em> <em><strong>Na aho na raatrih nabho na bhoomih na aaseet tamo jyotih abhoot cha<br>

pumaan tat aaseet ||</strong></em> There was no day, no night, no sky, no earth, no <em>tamas</em>, no light or darkness. There was nothing which could be known from <em>shrotra</em> and others. <em>Pradhaana, Brahma</em> and <em>samashti purusha</em>, were there.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vishnoh svaroopaat paratah udite dve roope pradhaanam purushascha<br>
vipra |</strong></em> <em><strong>Tasya eva te anyena dhrute viyukte roopaantaram tat dvija kaala<br>

<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Tat eva shloka dvayam darshayati - na ahah iti | Shrotra aadi<br>

Because there was no <em>shabda</em>, etc., everything was merged in <em>pradhaana, prakruti</em>, it was <em>avyakta</em>, and not divided into name and form. *Pancha bhoota *<em>tattvas</em> were not there. There was nothing that could be known through <em>shrotra</em> and others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pradhaanam eva praadhaanikam, svaarthe thak pratyayah |</strong></em> <em>Pradhaana</em> means <em>moola prakruti</em>, it was <em>avyakta</em>.</p>
<p>[[86]] <em><strong>Brahma cha, pumaan samashti purushascha ekam aaseet, * tam aaseet<br>
tamasaa goodham agre, * tamah pare deve ekee bhavati * ityaadi<br>
shruteh |</strong></em> <em>Pradhaana, Brahma, samashti purusha</em>, the collectivity of all the *chetanaas *- were all existing as one. <em>Shruti pramaanaas</em> are given. <em>Srushti</em> happens, and <em>pralaya</em> happens in the reverse order. In <em>srushti</em>, causes become effects, and <em>kaarana</em> becomes *kaarya, *<em>prakruti</em> becomes <em>mahat, mahat</em> becomes *ahamkaara, *<em>ahamkaara</em> becomes <em>tanmaatraas</em>, etc. In <em>pralaya</em>, it is reverse order, <em>tanmaatraas</em> become merged into <em>ahamkaara, ahamkaara</em> merges in <em>mahat, mahat</em> merges in <em>prakruti</em>, then all the <em>samashti purushaas</em> join together, everything joins *Paramaatman. Avyaktam akshare leeyate, *<em>aksharam tamasi leeyate, tamah pare deve ekee bhavati</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>shruti</em>, it is told wonderfully about <em>pralaya</em>. There is <em>naasadeeya sookta</em>, in <em>Rig</em> and <em>Yajur vedaas</em>. There was nothing - there was no death, nor immortality, it was one with <em>svadhaa</em>. There is a question asked - who knows from where everything came? Who created all these things? *Yah asya *<em>adhyakshah parame vyoman</em>. In <em>parama vyoma</em>, one who is presiding over all these things, He knows. He only knows, nobody else knows.</p>
<p><em><strong>Na aho na raatrih iti sthoola kaala upaadhi bhoota jyotitaraadi<br>
nishedhe api tadaa aaseet iti nirdeshaat sookshmah kaalah asti iti<br>
gamyate |</strong></em> <em>Kaala</em> is said to be two - <em>akhanda kaala</em> and *khanda kaala. Akhanda *<em>kaala</em> means there is no division - there is one time. <em>Khanda kaala</em> means we see divisions like *kalaa, kaashtha, muhoortha, aho, raatri, paksha, maasa, **samvatsara *- this is <em>oupaadhika</em>. It is told that there is no day, no night, no light, no darkness - those which give the division of time we see here. The word <em>tadaa</em> indicates time. Though there was no division of time we see here, like day, night, etc., one <em>akhanda kaala</em>, the <em>sookshma kaala</em> still existed at that time.  [[87]]</p>
<p>So, what existed before <em>srushti</em> was <em>pradhaana</em> or *avyakta, *<em>Brahman</em> and <em>samashti purushaas. Brahman</em> is *nitya vibhooti vishshta. Nitya *<em>vibhooti</em> is outside the scope of this creation and destruction. *Nitya *<em>vibhooti</em> is eternally present there. <em>Paramaatman</em> who is *nitya vibhooti **vishishta, divya soori vishishta, divya bhooshana, divya aayudha, divya *<em>mahishi</em>, was existing, along with <em>pradhaana</em> and <em>samashti purusha</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vishnoh svaroopaat iti | Atra svaroopa shabdo roopa vachanah;<br>
svaroopaat roopaat |</strong></em> This means from <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s shareera</em>. It is not that <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> essential nature itself divided into <em>purusha</em> and <em>pradhaana</em>.</p>
<p><em>Chetana samashti</em> and <em>achetana</em> which was existing as *avyakta *- they were present at that time. Two forms which are <em>pradhaana</em> and <em>purusha</em> manifested.</p>
<p><em><strong>Udite udbhoote; aarshah sandhih |</strong></em> We can say as <em>paratah udite</em>, which is <em>aarsha sandhi</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Dite iti paricchede vibhakte iti arthah tasmaat tamas sanjaayate * iti<br>
shruteh |</strong></em> Or can say that <em>paratah dite, viyukte</em>, separated. Two forms separated from Him, inseparably associated but differentiated.</p>
<p><em><strong>Te roope viyukte |</strong></em></p>
<p>[[88]] <em><strong>Srushti arha samyoga virahite yathaa syaataam tathaa tasya eva, yena<br>
anyena ghrute stah tat roopaantaram kaala sanjyam |</strong></em> <em>Avyakta</em> and <em>samshti purusha</em> were united into <em>Paramaatman</em> as if they cannot be separated as though they are one. During <em>srushti</em>, they manifest in such a way that they can become effects, can manifest themselves in the gross form; they become separated from <em>Paramaatman</em> in such a way that they can manifest. Another thing which supports this is <em>kaala</em>, time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Te anye anye aarshatvaat saadhuh sandhih |</strong></em> This is the <em>aarsha sandhi</em> told by a <em>rishi</em>.</p>

This <em>pralaya</em> is called <em>praakruta pralaya</em>. Whatever was present in <em>prakruti</em>, when creation happens, it gets manifested. Because it was all merged into <em>prakruti</em>, and present in <em>prakruti</em>, it is called <em>praakruta pralaya</em>.</p>

Everything happens at a particular time, <em>srushti</em> happens at a particular time. Getting manifested, creation, are like a continuous stream happening; in this way, one of the causes is also <em>kaala</em>. Like <em>vyakta</em>, whatever is manifest, <em>kaala</em> does not merge into <em>prakruti. Kaala</em> is said to be *anaadi *- there is no beginning and there is no end.</p>

Or <em>samyama</em> can be told as <em>jagat niyamana anupravesha</em> doing <em>anupravesha</em> for controlling happens.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prakruti purusha roopavat kaala roopam api parasmin antarhitam |</strong></em> Just like <em>prakruti</em> and <em>samashti purushaas</em> which get united with <em>Paramaatman</em> and stay one with Him, <em>kaala</em> is also united with <em>Paramaatman</em>.</p>

It becomes favourable for creation according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the sentients who are all going to be part of creation. We can say that time becomes ripe for creation.</p>

What is the readiness of <em>pradhaana</em> for creation, means, He creates disturbance in the three qualities, <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em>, so that it  [[92]] starts getting modified. For <em>chetanaas</em>, the readiness for creation is *jnyaana *<em>vikaasa</em>; during <em>pralaya</em>, their <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> is contracted very much, so that they are lying down like <em>achetana</em>; during <em>srushti</em>, He will make them know, and his experiences and impressions from the earlier births, he will be made aware of all that. <em>Vyaya</em> is <em>vikaara</em>, undergoing change, and <em>avyaya</em> is <em>kootastha, jeevaatmans</em> will not be undergoing any change.

Just by mere presence, mere nearness, fragrance creates disturbance or agitates what is nearby, of the mind; fragrance by mere nearness, can cause change to undergo in the mind, without being an instrument; in the same way, by <em>Paramaatman</em>, the disturbance is like that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Eeshvarah prakruti purushayoh kshobhane api svayam avikaarah iti<br>

<p><em><strong>Yathaa gandhah kinchit vikaara rahito api sannidhi maatrena manasah<br>

Just its mere presence causes <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em>, which are <em>vikaaras</em> of the mind. The mind undergoes change.  [[93]] The fragrance does not undergo any change, it is just present nearby. Just its mere presence causes <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em>, which are <em>vikaaras</em> of the mind. The mind undergoes change. Just like this, <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s</em> presence can itself cause change in <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em>.</p>

<p>A question arises. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 31:</strong></em> <em><strong>Sa eva kshobhako brahman kshobhyah cha purushottamah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Sa sankocha vikaasaabhyaam pradhaanatve api cha sthitah ||</strong></em> The one who causes this disturbance is also He only, the one who undergoes disturbance is also He only.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Gandha drushtaantena tasya nimittatvam eva kim iti aashankaayaam<br>
upaadaanam api sa eva iti aaha - sa eva iti |</strong></em> The <em>gandha</em> which is present, which causes disturbance in the mind, is not <em>upaadaana kaarana</em> for those effects, it is only <em>nimitta</em>. Is <em>Paramaatman</em> also only <em>nimitta kaarana</em>, as <em>gandha drushtaanta</em> is given. How can He be told as <em>upaadaana kaarana</em> also? This is established here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kshobakah san pradhaana purushaatmakam svayam eva kshobayati |</strong></em> He, who has <em>pradhaana</em> and <em>purusha</em> as His body, changes Himself.</p>
<p><em><strong>Na hi svasmaat bahirbhootam kulaalo mrut pindam iva, * tat<br>

<p>This is told wonderfully in the <em>Prakruti Adhikarana</em>, which is the last-but-one <em>adhikarana</em> of the fourth <em>paada</em> of the First Chapter of <em>Brahma Sutraas</em>. There are six <em>sutraas</em>, and the first of these says &quot; *Prakrutih cha&quot;. *<em>Paramaatman</em> is only the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>. One of the reasons why He is told as <em>upaadaana kaarana</em> is <em>aatma kruteh</em>. From His own <em>shareera</em>, doing <em>sankalpa</em>, He created all these beings. <em>Achetana, chetana</em> are all His <em>shareera</em>, inseparably associated. Still He remains unchanged all the time. There is no change in His <em>svaroopa svabhaava</em>. There is change only in His attributes, which are <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana. Achetana</em> undergoes change in <em>svaroopa</em> itself, and <em>chetana</em> undergoes change in <em>svabhaava</em>, according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>jeevaatman</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Na kevalam jagat upaadaanam, kaarya bhootam jagat api sa eva iti<br>
aaha - sa sankocha iti | Sankocha-vikaasaabhyaam yuktah<br>
pradhaanatve api sthitah sa eva |</strong></em> He is <em>nimitta kaarana</em> is told first; then it is told that He is *upaadaana *<em>kaarana</em>. Not only <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>, He is only present as effect. The world which is an effect is also He only. Associated with contraction and expansion, He is also present as <em>pradhaana</em>. Everything is Himself, but He is also their <em>shareeri</em>. They are all inseparably associated. The <em>shareeri</em> does not undergo any change.</p>
<p>We also see this in the <em>jeevaatman</em>. During young age, middle age, old age, all the changes happen to the body, whereas <em>jeevaatman</em> remains unchanged inside. They are associated inseparably. In the same way, <em>Paramaatman</em> who is <em>antaryaami</em>, though there is change in the <em>jeevaatman&rsquo;s dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, He does not undergo any change. He being <em>antaryaami</em> of everything, is present as everything, as everything is  [[95]] His <em>shareera</em>. Anything which has name and form is there only because He has done <em>antah pravesha</em>.</p>

<p>Now, <em>srushti</em> is going to be told. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 33:</strong></em> <em><strong>Guna saamyaat tatah tasmaat kshetrajnya adhisthitaat mune |</strong></em> <em><strong>Guna vyanjana sambhootih sarga kaale dvijottama ||</strong></em></p>

roopaat pradhaanaat, vyajyante anena gunaa iti guna vyanjanam<br>
mahat tattvam, tasya sambhootih |</strong></em>  [[96]] <em>Tatah</em> means after <em>Paramaatman</em> starts creation. From the <em>pradhaana</em> which was existing before <em>srushti</em>, having all <em>gunaas</em> in equality, being impelled by the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>kshetrajnyaas</em>. At the time of <em>srushti</em>, the first thing created is <em>guna vyanjana</em>, which is <em>mahat tattva</em>. In the *moola *<em>prakruti</em> form, the <em>gunaas</em> are all equal. Whereas when there is some disturbance, and something undergoes change, then <em>prakruti</em> becomes <em>mahat</em>. In the <em>mahat</em>, some <em>guna</em> will be prominent.</p>
<p>We saw so far how before <em>srushti</em>, <em>Paramaatman</em> makes them ready for creation, and brings awareness, <em>samskaara</em>, and makes it ready for *guna *<em>vaishamya</em>; He being <em>antaryaami</em> is the cause, and everything happens in Him. Everything is Him only, and the effect is also Him only. He is only the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>, the material cause. Though He is *upaadaana *<em>kaarana</em>, He does not undergo any change. It is not like a potter who makes a pot out of mud.</p>
<p><em>Bhagavaan</em> will start when the time comes; He does the <em>sankalpa, kaala</em> will make everything ready. Time becomes right for creation to start, according to the <em>karmaas</em> of all the <em>jeevaas. Paramaatman</em> will do <em>anupravesha</em>, He will impel them; the <em>guna saamya</em> will get disturbed; <em>guna vaishamya</em> will come in <em>pradhaana</em>, He will do <em>sankalpa - bahusyaam prajaayeya</em>. With all the changes happening in <em>prakruti</em> and <em>purusha, Bhagavaan</em> remains unchanged.</p>
<p>An example was given, of fragrance. Fragrance, when present creates a reaction in the mind, and it does not get changed in any way. <em>Paramaatman</em> also does not get changed in any way; He brings about changes in <em>prakruti</em> and <em>purusha</em>. And, He is also not just *nimitta *<em>kaarana</em> like fragrance, but He is also the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>, as the changes happen in Him only. Because everything is associated inseparably with <em>Paramaatman</em> only. Changes are in <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s shareera</em> and not in His <em>svaroopa</em> or <em>svabhaava. Achetana</em> and <em>chetana</em> are inseparably associated  [[97]] with Him as His <em>shareera</em>. He is controlling them, He is their support and master.</p>
<p>Creation of the various <em>tattvaas</em>, in order, is going to be told now.</p>
<h2 id="33-1">33</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 33:</strong></em> <em><strong>Guna saamyaat tatah tasmaat kshetrajnya adhisthitaat mune |</strong></em> <em><strong>Guna vyanjana sambhootih sarga kaale dvijottama ||</strong></em></p>
<p>There is a <em>vaishamya</em> in the <em>gunaas</em> which is happening, one of them becomes more or less, and creation starts. <em>Moola prakruti</em> becomes *mahat. *<em>Mahat</em> becomes *guna vyanjana. Vyajyante anena gunaah *- qualities are shown in this. Impelled by the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>kshetrajnya</em>, the <em>jeevaatmans</em>, due to <em>prakruti</em>, the <em>mahat tattva</em> is formed at the time of creation.</p>
<h2 id="34">34</h2>
<p>The next stages of creation are explained. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 2, Shloka 34:</strong></em> <em><strong>Pradhaana tattvam udbhootam mahaantam tat samaavrunot |</strong></em> <em><strong>Saatviko raajasah cha eva taamasah cha tridhaa mahaan ||</strong></em></p>

There is one more <em>sattva</em> known as <em>shuddha sattva</em>, or <em>parama sattva</em>, which  [[99]] is in <em>Parama Pada</em>; this <em>sattva</em> is different from the <em>sattva guna</em> of <em>prakruti</em>. Because the <em>sattva guna</em> of <em>pradhaana</em> undergoes changes. Whereas the <em>shuddha sattva</em> in <em>Parama Pada</em> does not undergo any change. The <em>Moksha dharma</em> quotation is told about how the <em>vaikaarika</em> word is mentioned.</p>

Taamasa *<em>ahamkaara</em> will modify and create <em>shabda tanmaatra</em>.</p>
<p><em>Tanmaatra</em> is a middle state. When milk becomes curd, the mid state between milk and curd, called as <em>kalala</em>, is like the <em>tanmaatra</em>. In the same way, <em>taamasa ahamkaara</em> becomes <em>shabda tanmaatra</em>, and then becomes <em>aakaasha. Shabda tanmaatra</em> is a very <em>sookshma avasthe</em>.</p>
<p>From <em>taamasa ahamkaara</em>, assisted by *raajasa ahamkaara, shabda *<em>tanmaatra</em> is created. From <em>shabda tanmaatra, aakaasha</em> is created. From <em>aakaasha, sparsha tanmaatra</em> is created. From *sparsha tanmaatra, *<em>vaayu</em> is created. From <em>vaayu, roopa tanmaatra</em> is created. From *roopa *<em>tanmaatra, tejas (agni)</em> is created. From <em>tejas, rasa tanmaatra</em> is created. From <em>rasa tanmaatra, ap</em> is created, water. From <em>ap, gandha tanmaatra</em> is created. From <em>gandha tanmaatra, pruthivi</em> is created. *Aakaashaat vaayuh, **vaayoh agnih, agneh aapah, apbhyah pruthivi. Aakaasha, vaayu, agni, ap, *<em>pruthivi</em> are the <em>pancha bhootaas</em>. In between states are the <em>tanmaatraas</em>.</p>
<p>We should understand that there should not be any <em>virodha</em> between <em>shrutis</em> and <em>smrutis</em>. In <em>shrutis</em>, in one place, it says &rsquo; <em>Ashtou prakrutayah, shodashakascha vikaaraah</em>&rsquo; - there are eight causes, and there are sixteen effects. The eight causes are *moola prakruti, mahat, *<em>ahamkaara</em>, and five <em>tanmaatraas</em>. The sixteen <em>vikaaraas</em>, effects, are eleven <em>indriyaas</em> and <em>pancha bhootaas</em>.</p>
<p>In the <em>srushti prakarana</em> of <em>Chandogya</em> and in <em>Taittriya Upanishad</em>, the <em>tanmaatraas</em> are not mentioned. Whereas in the *laya *<em>prakarana</em> of <em>Subaalopanishad</em>, the <em>tanmaatraas</em> are mentioned. <em>Tanmaatraani bhootaadou leeyante</em>.</p>

From <em>gandha tanmaatra, pruthivi</em> is created. <em>Pruthivi</em> is said to be <em>sanghaata, bhoomi</em>. It is called <em>sanghaata</em> because it is collectivity of all the five qualities, <em>shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, gandha. Tasmaat</em> means, from the <em>gandha tanmaatra</em>, associated with the previous four *tanmaatraas, *<em>pruthivi</em> is created. Its main quality is said to be <em>gandha</em>, and it has also the previous four qualities.</p>
<p>[[105]] The five elements are created from the <em>tanmaatraas. Aakaasha</em> itself will not create <em>vaayu</em>, but <em>aakaasha</em> will modify to <em>shabda tanmaatra</em>, and <em>vaayu</em> is created from <em>shabda tanmaatra. Vaayu</em> itself will not create <em>tejas</em>, but <em>vaayu</em> will modify to <em>roopa tanmaatra</em>, and <em>tejas</em> is created from it. <em>Tanmaatraas</em> are the causes of the elements, they being assisted by the previous <em>tanmaatraas</em>.</p>
<p>There are other views. One view is that <em>aakaasha</em> will get modified into <em>sparsha tanmaatra</em> and <em>vaayu</em>. But ultimately, <em>Paramaatman</em> being the <em>upaadaana</em> and <em>nimitta kaarana</em> of everything, and <em>antaryaami</em> of everything, everything culminates in Him. He is the sole creator of everything. There is a <em>pramaana</em> that <em>Adbhyo agnih, agni</em> is created from water, in <em>Taittiriya Aranyaka</em>. Whereas in the <em>srushti prakarana</em>, it says <em>agneraapah</em>, that <em>ap</em> is created from <em>agni</em>. The <em>pramaana</em> from <em>Taittiriya Aranyaka</em> is to be taken as <em>vyashti srushti</em> and not <em>samashti srushti</em>. For example, lightning is said to have water as its cause - from the water carrying cloud, lightning is created.</p>
<p>The first element <em>aakaasha</em> has <em>shabda</em> as quality. Second element <em>vaayu</em> has got <em>shabda</em> and <em>sparsha</em> as qualities. Third element <em>tejas</em> is created from <em>roopa tamnaatra</em>, has <em>shabda, sparsha, roopa</em> as qualities. <em>Ap</em> is created from <em>rasa tanmaatra</em>, it is associated with the previous three <em>tanmaatraas</em>, and has got four qualities. The final element, <em>pruthivi</em>, is created from <em>gandha tanmaatra</em>, and is associated with *shabda, sparsha, *<em>roopa, rasa</em>.</p>

prakaara eva srushti kramah |</strong></em> Now, the explanation of the <em>vishesha</em> is given. <em>Tanmaatraas</em> are said to be <em>avishesha</em>, and elements are said to be <em>vishesha. Sattva, rajas, tamas</em>, give rise to the qualities of <em>shanta, ghora</em> and *moodha *- peaceful or quiet, frightful; these qualities are not seen in the <em>tanmaatraas</em> and hence are called <em>avisheshaas</em>. With this, the creation of the elements is concluded. The elements and their respective <em>tanmaatraas</em>, are all created from <em>taamasa ahamkaara</em>. This is in the order that is told, and not just directly. There are some statements that say that from <em>aakaasha</em> only, <em>vaayu</em> is created, from <em>vaayu</em> only <em>agni</em> is created, etc., this is opposed to what is told in the <em>shrutis</em>, that there are only eight causes and sixteen effects. <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> says that even he has commented that <em>aakaasha</em> comes from <em>shabda tanmaatra</em> only, and from there, <em>sparsha tanmaatra</em> comes, etc. and the order has to be like that. <em>Shruti</em> also says that from <em>pruthivi</em>, trees are all created. When <em>prakruti</em> modifies into trees, <em>pruthivi</em> is not the cause of <em>tattvaas</em>; so there is no <em>virodha</em> there. For example, <em>vaayu</em> is not counted as a cause, but <em>sparsha tanmaatra</em> is counted as a cause. But, if <em>pruthivi</em> becomes a cause for the trees, is this not opposed to the <em>shrutis</em>, means, <em>pruthivi</em> is not the cause of any <em>tattva</em>. There is no contradiction here, as this happens in <em>vyashti srushti</em> only. Therefore, what is told here is the order in which is has to be accepted.</p>

manasah srushtih iti |</strong></em> From <em>vaikaarika ahamkaara</em>, which is <em>saatvika ahamkaara</em>, the <em>indriyaas</em> are created, assisted by <em>taijasa, raajasa ahamkaara</em>. But some people say that from <em>raajasa ahamkaara</em> itself, the <em>indriyaas</em> are created; <em>Paraasharar</em> says that this is not his view, and is not acceptable to him. The <em>indriyaas</em> are told as <em>devaah. Bhagavaan</em> is there with the <em>indriyaas</em> always, but they never know Him. <em>Paraasharar&rsquo;s paksha</em> is that they are from <em>saatvika ahamkaara</em>. For every <em>indriya</em>, there is an <em>adhishtaatru devataa</em>, who is presiding over it, and controlling the functions; <em>indriyaas</em> are all <em>achetanaas</em>, and have an <em>devataa. Raajasa ahamkaara</em>, which is called <em>taijasa</em> here, only assists <em>saatvika ahamkaara</em> and <em>taamasa ahamkaara</em> in their respective creations. This is also told clearly in <em>Vaayu Puraana</em> also. It is discussed at  [[109]] one place that <em>manas</em> is made of <em>anna</em>, which is <em>pruthivi</em>; this view is not correct.</p>
<p>The <em>raajasa ahankaara</em> only assists <em>saatvika</em> and <em>taamasa ahankaaras</em> is told in <em>Vaayu purana</em>. Another view is also discussed and refuted here: some say that <em>ahankaara tattva</em> is only <em>nimitta kaarana</em> (efficient cause) of <em>indriyas</em> and <em>bhutas</em> (elements) only are <em>upaadaana kaarana</em> (material cause). They quote the *Upanishat vakya – ‘anna mayam hi somya manah aapomayah *<em>praanah tejomayee vaak</em>’. But that is not correct. Because <em>annamayam</em> means here anna is <em>apyaayaka</em> to <em>manas</em> (that is food is appealing or causes happiness to mind). So <em>ahankaara</em> is only <em>upaadaana kaarana</em> and <em>bhutas</em> are only <em>aapyaayakas</em>. The order of creation of <em>indriyas</em> is like this: from <em>vaikaarika ahankaara</em> (or <em>saatvika ahankaara</em>) in order with the help of five <em>tanmaatras</em> starting with <em>shabda tanmaatra</em>, the five <em>jnaanendriyas – shabda</em> and others are created. From <em>vaikaarika ahankaara</em> itself with the help of five <em>tanmaatras</em> again <em>vaak</em> and other five <em>karmendriyaas</em> are created. <em>Manas</em> is created directly from <em>vaikaarika ahankaara</em> only (without the help of <em>tanmaatras</em>).</p>
<p><em>Saatvika ahamkaara</em> is only the cause of all the eleven <em>indriyaas</em>. This is the <em>siddhaanta</em> told by <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em>.</p>

Tejas</em> and <em>vaayu</em> are said to be <em>ghora. Aakaasha</em> is said to be <em>moodha</em>. When they are all mixed up, all of them have got all the three qualities. For example, if the <em>aakaasha</em> element is taken, and made into two parts - one half of it is remaining as <em>aakaasha</em>; if the second half of <em>aakaasha</em> is made into four parts, those four parts are filled with one part of <em>vaayu</em>, one part of <em>tejas</em>, one part of <em>ap</em>, one part of <em>pruthivi</em>. So, <em>aakaasha</em> is 50 percent <em>aakaasha</em>, and 12.5 percent each of <em>vaayu, tejas, ap, pruthivi</em>. Similarly with *vaayu, *<em>tejas, ap, pruthivi</em>. This is called <em>pancheekarana prakriyaa</em>. The *Brahma *<em>Sutraas</em> say that this is done directly by *Paramaatman *- it is told as <em>trivrutkarana</em>, which is same as <em>pancheekarana. Paramaatman</em> only does this, as <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> is not yet created. This is directly done by <em>Paramaatman</em>, during <em>srushti</em>, after <em>praakruta pralaya</em>. After <em>pancheekarana</em>, if we see the <em>aakaasha</em>, it has got 50 percent of <em>aakaasha</em>, and 12.5 percent of the remaining four. It is still called <em>aakaasha</em>, as it has abundance of <em>aakaasha</em>. All the elements have got all the other elements also, in part.</p>

He is beyond the defects of <em>guna</em> and others. <em>Praakruta sattva, rajas, tamas gunaas</em> are not there in <em>Paramaatman</em>. These qualities, the entire host of sages cannot praise or sing or understand, because they are all far away from <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em>.</p>
<p>We will take up the further <em>shlokaas</em> in the next session. We saw how the <em>indriyaas</em> are created, and <em>pancheekarana</em> is done, mixing up of the <em>pancha bhootaas</em> in the right proportion, and how creation cannot continue without this, then the creation of the <em>anda</em>, Cosmic Egg, then <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, and further creation by <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, with <em>Paramaatman</em> as <em>antaryaami</em>. This was told as &rsquo; <em>Jagat cha sah</em>&rsquo;. Everything is <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, and changes that are happening are in His <em>shareera. Paramaatman</em> remains unaffected, and immutable.</p>
<p>We have so far studied the second half of the second chapter of *Sri Vishnu *<em>Puraanam</em>, where the creation of the <em>tattvaas</em>, the elements, and their mixing up called <em>pancheekarana kriyaa</em>, and then creation of the <em>brahmaanda</em>, Cosmic Egg, and <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, were explained. How it is surrounded by seven <em>aavaranaas</em> was told. <em>Paramaatman</em>, being the <em>antaryaami</em>, creates according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the *chetanaas *- he gives them the respective <em>deha, indriyaas</em>, etc. He Himself remains untouched by all these. As long as the days and nights of *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> are there, <em>Bhagavaan</em> protects all that is created. He also supports the <em>Nitya Vibhooti - shloka</em> 62 of <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 2.</p>

Taking on the <em>avataara</em> of <em>Vishnu</em>, He does sustenance. The forms responsible for creation, sustenance and end of the world, <em>Bhagavaan</em> having them as His <em>shareera</em>, controlling them and making them do all the acts, He only does everything, and everything culminates in Him ultimately. Here is a grammatical item mentioned, this is told by a <em>rishi</em>, so we have to accept it. Or, the means to the acts of creation, sustenance, etc. - those states of <em>Brahma, Vishnu</em> and <em>Shiva - Bhagavaan</em> only takes them. Cause and effect - effect is <em>avasthaantaraapatti</em> of <em>kaarana</em>; another state of the cause. <em>Bhagavaan</em> only is the cause and the effect. The modifications and changes are in His body, and in His nature, there is no change. There are changes in His <em>shareera</em>.</p>

What is told in this <em>shloka</em> is that - <em>Brahma</em> the creator, <em>Daksha</em> and others who are created, <em>Rudra</em> who is the destroyer, the three worlds which are destroyed, addressing them at the same time; there is no difference between the creator and created, the destroyer and the destroyed, because such form is being told. He creates *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em>, and being his <em>antaryaami</em>, creates everything. He protects being <em>Vishnu</em>, and destroys being <em>Rudra</em>. But, He is not attached to any of these. All the creations happen according to the <em>karmaas</em> of <em>kshetrajnyaas</em>. He controls the <em>guna niyantrutva</em>; the <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em> becoming more or less. When <em>sattva</em> is more, <em>jnyaana pravrutti</em> happens; when <em>rajas</em> is more, there is a lot of action, desire; when <em>tamas</em> is more, there is ignorance, sleep. All this happens in the <em>kshetrajnya</em> according to his <em>karma</em>. The qualities keep varying, being associated with <em>prakruti</em>. The <em>kshetrajnya</em> experiences various things because of this. Everything happens according to <em>karma</em> of <em>kshetrajnya</em>, and <em>Bhagavaan</em> does not have any enjoyership, <em>bhoktrutva</em>. This is explained by the word <em>svayam prabhuh</em>; He remains the Lord. Everything is happening in His <em>shareera</em> and not in Himself. There is no change in His nature, though He remains <em>antaryaami</em> and controls and supports everything.  [[124]]</p>

It was told <em>jagat cha sah</em>, He was identified with everything.

Entire world is His <em>shareera</em>, controlled by Him, subservient to Him, being supported by Him. He is <em>vishva roopa</em>. He is immutable, unchanging. He is the self of all the beings, the entire world is His <em>shareera</em>. Because of this, He is only everything. Creation, sustenance, destruction are all His acts only. <em>Leela</em> is all His mere sport; when He is doing creation, sustenance, etc., He is engaged in sport; it is all useful for <em>Bhagavaan</em> only, who has taken *leelaa *<em>avataara</em>. Just as all activities and functions of our body are useful to the <em>aatman</em> inside. Just like this, creation, sustenance, destruction are all useful to the <em>Paramaatman</em> only. It is <em>upakaaraka</em> to Him, who is <em>shareeri</em>, and it is all mere sport.</p>

varaneeyah |</strong></em> Whatever was told is concluded here. The one who does the acts of creation and others, He is only being created. He only is present in all forms. How can creation and others be attributed to Brahma and others - this is possible because He grants all boons. He gives them the power to do creation, but He being <em>antaryaami</em>. Brahma and others who have taken refuge in Him, He gives the boons. The way of creation is being taught to Brahma and others, by <em>Paramaatman</em> only. Because of being shown how to do it, they become the creators or destroyers. Krishna says to Arjuna that &lsquo;I have already killed everyone, you are only an instrument&rsquo;. *Atti - adyate cha | Paati - paalyate **cha | Srujya - sarga kartaa cha | *</p>
<p>What was started as <em>jagat cha sah</em>, in this process, the entire creation was told, <em>pancheekarana, samashti srushti, vyashti srushti</em>, creation of Brahma and others, and through them doing everything, that it is all His different forms only, was told. Because He does <em>anupravesha</em> only, any <em>vastu</em> gets <em>vastutva</em>; otherwise it cannot even exist. He supports everything. He controls everything, and everything is meant for His purpose. He does creation according to the <em>karmaas</em> of the <em>kshetrajnyaas</em>. Creation is mere sport for Him. He only creates Himself and protects Himself. He withdraws unto Himself. Entire world is Him only. All these are real entities only. Because He is existing as <em>antaryaami</em>, all the words in the ultimate sense connote <em>Paramaatman</em> only.</p>
<p>This concludes the Second Chapter.</p>
