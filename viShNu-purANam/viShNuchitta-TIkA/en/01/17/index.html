If he is not born again, even the current birth that we have cannot happen. If another birth happens, then we can actually justify our current birth. This is the <em>pramaana</em> for that, the students are learning all this in <em>Aagama</em>, &lsquo;Having died and gone from here, he is again born&rsquo;, &lsquo;The path in which he goes - the same path he returns here&rsquo;, the path of <em>Pitru yaana</em> is told, &lsquo;Having died, he will again get into <em>samsaara</em>, and again die&rsquo;. Whatever is told in <em>Aagamaas</em>, is again supported by <em>tarka</em>, which is in line with what is taught in the *Aagamaas. *<em>Tarka</em> is logic, which by itself cannot be an independent <em>pramaana</em> for <em>ateendriya vishayaas</em>. Logic is also useful in order to understand what is taught in the <em>Shrutis</em>, in order to also make things more firm and clear in our mind. This is against the <em>Chaarvaakaas</em>, who say that only the <em>Pratyaksha pramaana</em> is accepted, and they say that <em>Shruti</em> is not a *pramaana *- they say that <em>deha</em> is itself the <em>aatman</em>, and destruction of  [[558]] the body is itself <em>moksha</em>; they say that when the body is burnt and becomes ashes, how can it come again; this is not acceptable. The logic which <em>Prahlaada Aalwaar</em> is telling here is supporting what is taught in the *Shrutis *- that without a material cause, an effect cannot happen. If one is born, there has to be a material cause for that, and if the soul was not there, he could not have been born taking another body. In every being, what is seen is the effects of <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em>. In the previous births, whatever <em>sukruta</em> and <em>duskhruta</em> which one has done, having all these, if an <em>aatman</em>, the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>, is not there, such an experience of <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em> cannot happen. The experience of <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em> happens in the <em>aatman</em> himself, and he is the cause of that only. He is also <em>nimitta kaarana</em>, and also the <em>upaadaana kaarana</em>. The experience of <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em> happens in the <em>aatman</em> himself, because of the virtuous deeds and sins. This is the logic used here to justify that <em>aatman</em> is permanent, and eternal, and is only born again. This is how beings are born again and again, and undergo *janma, baalya, youvana, *<em>jaraa, mrutyu</em>. When they ( <em>Chaarvaakaas</em>) say that <em>pratyaksha</em> only is the <em>pramaana</em>, they are refuted here, through this logic. ***</p>

If we are very thirsty, and we get water to drink, we feel happiness. Similarly, when extreme cold is removed by fire, we feel very comfortable and happy.

Fire which burns and causes grief is thought to be causing happiness, in the presence of cold, and so thought of a means of happiness. When hunger is not there, food itself causes vomiting, indigestion, etc., which makes one suffer, and so they only become causes of grief. ***</p>

The <em>pratiyogi</em> of <em>agni</em> is <em>sheeta</em>, and vice versa. By itself, fire does not cause joy to someone, it burns and causes grief. If there is extreme cold, if fire is brought, it causes a feeling of happiness. Similarly, when one has taken too much water, we cannot give water to such a person; he will just reject it. Whereas when one is very thirsty, that water causes happiness and sometimes it causes grief also. Similarly with food - when one has overeaten, food itself causes grief, and leads to more trouble. Whereas when one is very hungry, it gives a feeling of happiness. Otherwise, if it is  [[562]] not there, if food is not there, when one is hungry, the absence of that causes <em>dukha</em>, and the presence of that causes <em>sukha</em>. Because it is not definitive whether food causes happiness or grief, it is wrong understanding that it causes happiness or grief alone. It will be told later that there is nothing which is <em>sukhaatmaka</em> or <em>dukhaatmaka</em>, and the object by itself is not causing <em>sukha</em> or <em>dukha</em>, but one&rsquo;s experiences or the state is what is causing that. ***</p>

He is not able to do anything as <em>Prahlaada</em> is totally immersed in the meditation of *Sri Hari, Mahaa *<em>Vishnu</em> and nothing can touch him. <em>Hiranyakashipu</em> says &lsquo;Feed him with food mixed with deadly poison&rsquo;, and <em>Prahlaada</em> simply eats it chanting the name of <em>Govinda</em>; he just digests everything and nothing happens to him. At that time, <em>Hiranyakashipu</em> calls the <em>purohitaas</em> again. ***</p>
