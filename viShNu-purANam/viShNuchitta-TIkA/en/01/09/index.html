He was following the <em>vrata</em> of behaving like an <em>unmatta</em>, inebriated. He begged her to give him that garland.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Unmatta iti | Unmatta vrata dhruk | Yogino hi jada unmatta<br>
pishaachavat vartante | Athavaa sanatkumaara shaapaat unmatta<br>

It is also said that yogis behave like this. <em>Yogis</em> when they are in <em>aatma anubhava</em>, behave like inert  [[297]] objects, <em>jada</em>, without realizing anything that is happening around. Or as though they are in an inebriated condition.</p>

<p>Next, the elephant throws it down, and <em>Durvaasa Muni</em> gets very angry, and curses <em>Indra</em>. After this, Indra loses all his wealth, and this is told as <em>tirodhaana</em> of <em>Shridevi</em>. The whole world loses all its prosperity. After that, they do <em>Amrutha mathana</em>, the churning of the ocean. <em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 9, where we were starting to study the part where <em>Durvaasa Muni</em>, when roaming around as a <em>yogi</em>, sees a <em>Vidyaadhara stree</em> carrying a wonderful garland, with most wonderful fragrance filling the entire area. He is so much attracted to it, and he begs her to give that garland, and she gives it to him with great respect. He carries it on his head, and is captivated by its fragrance.</p>

He is purer than everything that is pure; He is the <em>aadya</em>, the first, there is no one before Him. He does not have the <em>praakruta gunaas</em>, the material qualities of *sattva, *<em>rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em> of <em>prakruti</em>, because He has an *apraakruta divya mangala *<em>vigraha</em>. The various divisions of time are all controlled by <em>Paramaatman</em>. There is <em>kaala</em> in <em>Parama Pada</em> also, but <em>kaala</em> has no control there.

<p>The order of creation is <em>moola prakruti, mahat, ahamkaara</em>, etc. During <em>pralaya</em>, the <em>laya</em> order is that effects go and merge into their causes. In each one of these, they happen only because <em>Paramaatman</em> is <em>antaryaami</em>. It is not that <em>moola prakruti</em> itself becomes the cause of <em>mahat, mahat</em> becomes cause of <em>ahamkaara</em>, etc. <em>Mahat shareeraka Paramaatman</em> only becomes cause of <em>ahamkaara</em>. First, it is told in the <em>srushti</em> order, and then told in the <em>pralaya</em> order. In both of these, <em>Paramaatman</em> only is the cause in every single step.</p>

Such a <em>Paramaatman</em>, we bow in reverence.</p>
<p>It should be taken as <em>bhogya bhootam</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Bhoktaaram iti | Bhojyam bhogyam shabdaadi srujyam ghataadi<br>

The doers of all those are also <em>Paramaatman</em> only. <em>Param padam</em> has three meanings -<em>jeevaatma svaroopa</em>, the *Vaikuntha *(the <em>sthaana</em> where <em>Paramaatman</em> resides), *Paramaatma *<em>svaroopa</em> itself. Here it means <em>Bhagavaan</em> only.</p>
<h2 id="51">51</h2>
<p>After having eulogized <em>Bhagavaan</em> that He is what is seen in various states of effects or causes, if He is only present as cause and effect in various states, does He undergo any modifications, are there any defects in Him? These doubts are removed here. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 51:</strong></em> <em><strong>Vishuddha bodhavat nityam ajam akshayam avyayam |</strong></em> <em><strong>Avyaktam avikaaram yat tat vishnoh paramam padam ||</strong></em>  [[322]] He is <em>parishuddha jnyaana svaroopa</em>, He is eternal, He is unborn, He is undeteriorating, He is immutable, does not change, He is unmanifest, not easy to see or know, He does not undergo any change, that Supreme nature of <em>Paramaatman</em>, we pay our obeisance.</p>
<p>Though there are changes in His <em>shareera</em>, the <em>prakruti</em> undergoes change in its <em>svaroopa</em> itself, the <em>jeevaatmans</em> undergo change in their *dharma bhoota *<em>jnyaana, Paramaatman</em> who is <em>shareeri, antaryaami</em>, does not undergo any change at any point of time.</p>

He is not mere that, He is that and everything else also. He is untainted by any defects of <em>prakruti</em> or <em>jeevaatmans</em>, even though He is existing as the <em>antaryaami</em> of everything. We pay obeisance to Him.</p>

<p>When all the gods went and surrendered unto Him along with *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma, Bhagavaan</em> tells them to bring the <em>daityaas</em> also, and make them also part of this common activity, and tell them to partake the <em>amruta</em> which is going to be generated from this churning, and I will see to it that they will not partake this <em>amruta</em> but will only be subjected to all kinds of suffering and misery, and you will get all the benefits and get back all your wealth, powers and prosperity.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>ksheera saagara mathana</em> will start. Sage <em>Paraasharar</em> will start to tell that. <em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 9, where <em>Chaturmukha Brahma, devaas</em> and <em>rishis</em> eulogize <em>Paramaatman</em>, and pray to Him to appear before them, He promptly appears revealing His wonderful auspicious form, they surrender unto Him, and say that they have lost all their glory, and pray to restore their glory. <em>Bhagavaan</em> tells them to &ldquo;Do as I tell you, churn the <em>Ksheera Abdhi</em>, the Ocean of Milk, making <em>Mandara Parvata</em> itself as the staff, and the great serpent <em>Vaasuki</em> as the cord, include the <em>daanavaas</em>, and tell them that they will also get an equal portion of the <em>amruta</em> which is going to be generated from the churning. I will help you and see to it that they do not get the nectar of immortality, and you will get everything&rdquo;. <em>Paraasharar</em> says what happened after that.</p>

<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 9, the wonderful way in which Indra extolled the greatness of <em>Mahaalakshmi</em>, eulogized <em>Shridevi</em> who incarnated in the <em>Ksheera Samudra</em>, and also about <em>Shridevi&rsquo;s kataaksha</em>, which has such wonderful powers. All the <em>devaas</em> who were graced by Her <em>kataaksha</em> had all glory, and the <em>asuraas</em> who were denied of that were suffering.</p>

<h2 id="141">141</h2>
<p>Now, <em>Paraasharar</em> tells about the nature of Her manifestations. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 141:</strong></em> <em><strong>Bhrugoh khyaatyaam samutpannaa shreeh poorvam udadheh punah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Deva daanava yatnena prasootaa amruta manthane ||</strong></em> Initially She was born of <em>Bhrugu</em> in <em>Khyaati</em>, and again She manifested in the <em>Ksheera Abdhi</em>, during the churning of the ocean, for <em>amruta</em> which was done by <em>devaas</em> and <em>daanavaas</em>.</p>
<h2 id="142">142</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 142:</strong></em> <em><strong>Evam yadaa jagat svamee deva devo janaardanah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Avataaram karoti eshaa tadaa shreeh tat sahaayinee ||</strong></em> Whenever <em>Devadeva</em>, who is the Supreme of the Lords, the Master of the all the worlds, <em>Janaardana</em>, manifests, <em>Shri</em> also manifests along with Him.</p>
<p>[[356]] <em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Evam iti | Tat sahaayinee tena saha ayate gacchati iti tat sahaayinee,<br>
tat sahachaarinee iti arthah |</strong></em> One who goes with Him, She is always inseparably associated with Him, She always manifests along with Him, is the meaning.</p>
<h2 id="143">143</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 143:</strong></em> <em><strong>Punascha (padmaat utpannaa) padmaa sambhootaa hi aadityo abhoot<br>

When He manifested as <em>Bhaargava Raama, Parashuraama</em>, She manifested as <em>Harini</em>.</p>
<h2 id="144">144</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 144:</strong></em> <em><strong>Raaghavatve abhavat seetaa rukmanee krishna janmani |</strong></em> <em><strong>Anyeshu cha avataareshu vishnoh eshaa anapaayinee ||</strong></em> When <em>Bhagavaan</em> incarnated as <em>Sriraama</em>, She became <em>Seeta</em>. And, in His incarnation as <em>Krishna</em>, She manifested as <em>Rukmini</em>. In whatever *avataaraas *<em>Vishnu</em> is seen, She is always inseparably associated with Him.</p>
<h2 id="145">145</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 145:</strong></em> <em><strong>Devatve deva dehaa iyam manushyatve cha maanushee |</strong></em> <em><strong>Vishnoh deha anuroopaam vai karoti eshaa aatmanah tanum ||</strong></em> Whenever He takes the form of a <em>deva</em>, She also takes the form of a <em>devataa</em>. Whenever He takes the form of a human, She also takes a human  [[357]] form. Whatever form He takes in whichever class, accordingly She also manifests taking on a similar form.</p>
<h2 id="146">146</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 146:</strong></em> <em><strong>Yah cha etat shrunuyaat janma lakshmyaa yah cha pathet narah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Shriyo na vichyutih tasya gruhe yaavat kula trayam ||</strong></em> The purpose of <em>Paraasharar</em> teaching all these to Maitreya, is that it is going to be extremely beneficial for anyone who recites all these things. To this day, it brings all good to one who recites this. This <em>avataara</em> of <em>Lakshmi</em>, whoever listens to this, or whoever reads this, <em>Shridevi</em> will never desert him, and he will always be having all kinds of glory and prosperity.</p>
<h2 id="147">147</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 147:</strong></em> <em><strong>Pathyate yeshu cha eva eshaa gruheshu shree kathaa mune |</strong></em> <em><strong>Alakshmee kalahaadhaaraa na teshu aaste kadaachana ||</strong></em> In whichever house this story of <em>Shridevi&rsquo;s</em> manifestations is being read, <em>Alakshmi</em> who is the cause of all kinds of quarrel, will never find a place, will never be present in that house.</p>
<p>This is the greatness of the manifestation of <em>Shridevi</em>.</p>
<h2 id="148">148</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 148:</strong></em> <em><strong>Etat te kathitam sarvam yat maam tvam pariprucchasi |</strong></em> <em><strong>Ksheeraabdhou shreeh yathaa jaataa poorvam bhrugu sutaa satee ||</strong></em> As you requested me to tell, I have recited to you as it is, all of them - being the daughter of <em>Bhrugu</em> earlier, how She manifested in the <em>Ksheera Abdhi</em>.  [[358]]</p>
<h2 id="149">149</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 9, Shloka 149:</strong></em> <em><strong>Iti sakala vibhooti avaapti hetuh stutih iyam indra mukhodgaataa hi<br>
laskmyaah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Anudinam iha pathyate nrubhih yaih vasati na teshu kadaachit api<br>
alakshmeeh ||</strong></em> This <em>Lakshmi Stuti</em>, which has come from <em>Indra</em>, is the cause of one attaining all kinds of glory. Whoever reads this everyday, <em>Lakshmi</em> will never desert them.</p>
<p>This is the <em>phala</em> of the recitation. Most of the <em>puraana kathaas</em> have a <em>phala</em> in the end. This is why these <em>puraanaas</em> are recited, and people sit and listen to them. People do <em>paaraayanam</em> also. Because it brings in immense glories and all good.</p>
<p>Thus the Ninth Chapter comes to an end.</p>
