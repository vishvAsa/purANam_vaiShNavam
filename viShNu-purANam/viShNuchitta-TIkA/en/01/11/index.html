<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 24:</strong></em> <em><strong>Susheelo bhava dharmaatmaa maitrah praani hite ratah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Nimnam yathaa aapah pravanaah paatram aayaanti sampadam ||</strong></em> Become one with good <em>aachaara</em>, good conduct, and follow the path of <em>dharma</em>. Be friendly with everyone, be good to all beings. Waters which flow down will only be respected by everyone.</p>
<p>Engage in these kinds of things, and accumulate <em>punya</em>. This is the advice <em>Suniti</em> gives to <em>Dhruva. Dhruva</em> does not listen to this, and goes and does penance, which is a well known story.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we just started to study the *Dhruva *<em>upaakhyaana</em>, the story of <em>Dhruva</em>. When <em>Dhruva</em> feels extremely sad when he could not sit on the lap of his father, while his stepmother <em>Suruchi&rsquo;s</em> son <em>Uttama</em> sat on the lap, he gets extremely sad and comes to his mother crying, and <em>Suniti</em> gives him some wonderful advice, which is essentially the teachings of all <em>shaastraas</em>, the <em>karma siddhaanta</em>. She tells him &lsquo;O my son, please do not get disturbed; if you did not enjoy something, it is because you did not do the right deeds in your previous births earlier. The result what you get today is the result of your own past deeds. If you had done something good, you will enjoy good things. If you had not done something good, you will not get it. You should not worry about it. <em>Uttama</em> had done some good deeds in his previous births, so he gets to enjoy the benefits of the kingdom, whereas you had not done such good deeds, and so you are not getting. Whatever little one gets, an intelligent person should feel happy about it. This is what you deserve, based on the deeds done earlier. If everything is based on past deeds, is there no other way? The answer is that it is not so. <em>Shaastra</em> tells that it is possible to correct what you do in future. From now onwards, it is in your hands. Till now, whatever you did knowingly or unknowingly is all gone.  [[376]] From this point onwards, it is in your own hands to do the right things. If you do good deeds from now on, you will get to reap good benefits and enjoy good things in future. So, engage in good deeds from now on.&rsquo;</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 24:</strong></em> <em><strong>Susheelo bhava dharmaatmaa maitrah praani hite ratah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Nimnam yathaa aapah pravanaah paatram aayaanti sampadam ||</strong></em> Follow good conduct, <em>sadaachaara</em>, and follow the path of <em>dharma</em>. Be good to all the beings. If you start doing all these, you will definitely get good benefits in future. You have to be always caring for everyone, always follow the path of <em>dharma</em>, and not feel proud of yourself; waters when they flow down and form a pond, everyone wants to start using it, and respect that water.</p>
<p>So, she gives him wonderful advice. <em>Dhruva</em> is a <em>Kshatriya</em> child.</p>

<p>With the next three <em>shlokaas</em>, they teach the process of worshipping the Supreme <em>Brahman, Vishnu</em>, and also the mantra which has to be chanted. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 53:</strong></em> <em><strong>Baahyaarthaat akhilaat chittam tyaajayet prathamam narah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Tasmin eva jagat dhaamni tatah kurveeta nischalam ||</strong></em> First, one has to withdraw the mind from all the external sense objects. Mind should be steady, should not wander around here and there. Focussing the mind on only that ultimate refuge or resort of this whole world, and meditating upon that Supreme Being.</p>
<p>[[383]] Here they are going to teach <em>Ashtaanga Yoga</em>, is what we can understand from the Commentary. <em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Chitta ekaagrataa roopo yogo japasya angam iti sa yogam japyam<br>

The nature of that <em>yoga</em> is that it is required in order to attain concentration of mind. in order to do the <em>japa</em>, the accessory required is that one has to develop concentration of mind, and then do the <em>japa</em>, chanting of the <em>mantra</em>. Along with that *Ashtaanga *<em>yoga</em>, they teach him the <em>mantra</em> which is to be chanted. *Ashtaanga *<em>Yoga</em> has *yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa, *<em>dhyaana, samaadhi</em>. First, one has to give up all the external objects, giving up of telling lies, giving up doing <em>himsaa</em>, this is called <em>yama</em>; mind has to be controlled, one should desist from telling lies, and doing <em>himsaa; himsaa</em> by all the <em>tri karanaas. Pratyaahaara</em> is withdrawing the mind from all external sense objects. Achieving steadiness of the mind is possible through <em>aasana</em> and <em>praanaayaama</em>. Mind has to be steadily focussed on something. <em>Aasana</em> and <em>praanaayaama</em> are extremely essential. Focus the mind on the Supreme <em>Brahman</em>. Focus the mind on the *divya mangala *<em>vigraha</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, this is the <em>shubha aashraya</em>.</p>
<p>First, withdrawing the mind from everything external, giving up telling lies ( <em>anruta</em>), giving up <em>himsaa</em>, withdrawing the mind from all external sense objects, achieving steadiness of the mind, thinking of the *divya mangala *<em>vigraha</em> of <em>Paramaatman (dhaaranaa)</em>.</p>

One should put effort to achieve the <em>shaastreeya shuddhi</em>, this is called <em>niyama</em>. Focussing the mind on only one object, the <em>divya mangala vigraha</em> of the Supreme <em>Brahman. Tanmaya</em> means getting completely merged in that object of meditation, this is <em>samaadhi</em>.</p>
<p>How can we say that <em>rishis</em> have taught <em>Ashtaanga Yoga</em> here? This is explained in the Commentary. After a few <em>shlokaas, Paraasharar</em> says in <em>Shloka</em> 8 of the next chapter that he is said to be a <em>yogi</em>. This indicates that <em>Ashtaanga Yoga</em> is what is taught by the <em>rishis</em>.</p>

He is one to whom <em>kaala</em> is also a <em>shareera.</em> Some people say that <em>Hiranyagarbha</em> is <em>vyashti</em> and <em>Purusha</em> is *samashti. *<em>Samashti</em> is before the name and form differentiation, *naama roopa *<em>vyaakarana</em>, before <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> is created; up to that point, <em>Paramaatman</em> directly does the creation, where *prakruti, mahat, *<em>ahamkaara, pancha bhoota tattvaas</em> are all created. After creating *pancha *<em>bhootaas, Paramaatman</em> does <em>pancheekarana</em>, and then the name and form differentiation happens, from that time, it is called <em>vyashti srushti</em>. Before <em>vyashti srushti, Paramaatman</em> was Himself existing in those forms, means that He was *antaryaami, mahat shareeraka Paramaatman, *<em>ahamkaara shareeraka Paramaatman</em>, etc. Here, the *Dvaadashaakshara *<em>Mantra, Om Namo Vaasudevaaya</em> is meant, but only eight letters are here, <em>Pranava, Namaha</em> and <em>Vaasudevaaya</em>, because, in <em>Lainga Puraana</em>, it is well known that <em>Dvaadashaakshara</em> is what <em>saptarishis</em> taught <em>Dhruva</em>. Because it has to be taught in secrecy, one on one from <em>Aachaarya</em> to the <em>shishya</em>, in privacy, this is why it is not told here.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 56:</strong></em> <em><strong>Etat jajaapa bhagavaan japyam svaayambhuvo manuh |</strong></em> <em><strong>Pitaamahah tava puraa tasya tushto janaardanah ||</strong></em> They also justify why this <em>mantra</em> can yield such great results. They give an example. They tell <em>Dhruva</em> that his grandfather, <em>Svaayambhuva Manu</em>, also did <em>japa</em> with this <em>mantra</em>, and <em>Janaardana</em> was extremely pleased with him.</p>
<h2 id="57">57</h2>
<p>This is continuation of the previous <em>shloka</em>. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 11, Shloka 57:</strong></em> <em><strong>Dadou yathaa abhilaashitaam siddhim trailokya durlabhaam |</strong></em> <em><strong>Tathaa tvam api govindam toshaya etat sadaa japan ||</strong></em> That which cannot be easily obtained in all the three worlds, that <em>Janaardana</em> gave to <em>Svaayambhuva Manu</em>, who did <em>japa</em> with this mantra; <em>Svaayambhuva Manu</em> being your grandfather, you also do the same thing. Chanting this <em>mantra</em> continuously, all the time, you also try to please <em>Govinda</em>. With His grace, you will also attain whatever you desire.</p>
<p>[[386]] <em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Dadou iti | Tathaa tvam iti | Kula devataa mantro hi sheeghram<br>
siddhyati |</strong></em> Because his grandfather had done this <em>japa</em> of <em>Janaardana</em>, He is *kula *<em>devataa</em> for you, you should also do it, and you will very soon attain whatever you are seeking.</p>
<p>This completes the Eleventh Chapter. <em>Saptarishis</em> have taught him the way in which he has to worship <em>Govinda</em>, the <em>mantra</em> which he has to chant, and how that can yield the desired fruits, because his own grandfather attained whatever he desired by chanting this <em>mantra</em> and worshipping *Govinda, *<em>Janaardana</em> was extremely pleased with him and granted him all that he desired; you also chant this <em>mantra</em> and worship <em>Govinda</em>, He will be very pleased and He is the only one who can give you what you are desiring.</p>
