Amsha* means that they are all His *shareera*, His *vibhooti*, His *tanu*, His *vapu*.

Because *Vishnu* is *sarva bhoota*, He is everything, everywhere, all pervading, He is present as Inner Controller of everyone. They are all inseparably associated with *Vishnu*, they are all the *shareera* of *Vishnu*. There is *apruthaksiddha sambandha* with *Vishnu*.

Regarding the sustenance aspect, He is the one who sustains everything. He is always there, though He is old, He is new. Withdrawing everything unto Himself, He only does as an *antaka*, in the form of *Yama* who does *samhaara* of everything, taking the support of *rajas, sattva* and *tamas*, the *gunaas*. ***   
Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Paalanavat srushti samhaarayoh api tasya eva saamarthyam iti aaha -

***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 24:

***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Ekena iti | Avyakta moortimaan avyakta svaroopah | Mareechimishraah

Kaalah truteeyah tasya amshah sarvabhootaani cha aparah |   
Ittham chaturdhaa samsrushtou vartate asou rajogunah || ***In the third part, He is *kaala*. All the beings that are created are the fourth part of *Janaardana*. Having abundance of *rajas guna*, He does creation. At that time, He Himself is present as *Chaturmukha Brahma, Mareechi* and other *Prajaapatis, Kaala*, and all the beings that are created. He is inner controller of everything and everything is His *amsha* only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Kaalah iti | Rajo gune yasya cha rajogunah | ***





## 26
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 26:    
Ekaamshena sthito vishnuh karoti paripaalanam |   
Manu aadi roopah cha anyena kaala roopo aparena cha ||*** During sustenance, in one form, He is present as *Vishnu*. The second part of His is *Manu* and other forms, who are responsible for the sustenance part of it. *Kaala* is the third part. 





## 27
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 27:    
Sarva bhooteshu cha anyena samsthitah kurute sthitim |   
Sattvam gunam samaashritya jagatah purushottamah || ***In another part, He is present in all beings, because everyone is taking part in sustenance in some way or other. *Bhagavaan Purushottama* takes resort to *Sattva guna*, and *sattva* is more during sustenance. 





## 28
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 28:    
Aashritya tamaso vruttim anta kaale tathaa prabhuh |   
Rudra svaroopo bhagavaan ekaamshena bhavati ajah || *** [[640]] During dissolution, He takes resort to *tamo guna*. He is present as *Rudra* as one form. ***   


## 29
Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 29:    
Agni antaka aadi roopena bhaagena anyena vartate |   
Kaala svaroopo bhaago anyah sarva bhootaani cha aparah ||*** The second form of dissolution is *Agni* and *Yama*. Third part is *kaala*. Fourth part is all beings. 





## 30
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 30:    
Vinaasham kurvatah tasya chaturddhaivam mahaatmanah |   
Vibhaaga kalpanaa brahman kathyate sarvakaalikeem ||*** Destruction or dissolution is happening all the time. And there is a *praakruta **pralaya* also at some point. In one form, He is present as *Rudra* who does *samhaara*, second form is *Agni* and *Yama*, third form is *kaala*, and fourth form is all the beings. This kind of division is happening in every *kalpa*. In every *kalpa*, there are *Manvantaraas; Chaturmukha **Brahma* does the creation, *prajaapatis* are created, and all beings are in some way or other part of creation, sustenance and dissolution - these are happening in every *kalpa*. 



The gist is that during creation, sustenance or dissolution, *Vishnu* only is present in various forms. When we say that *Chaturmukha Brahma* did the creation, *Manu* did the sustenance, or that *Kaala* is responsible for all these, and that the beings are responsible in some way for all these things, all of these are actually happening by *Vishnu* only, being present in these forms as the Inner Controller, *antaryaami*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Vinaasham iti | Saarvakaalikee pratikalpa bhaavinee | ***





## 31
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 31:    
Brahmaa daksha aadayah kaalah tathaa eva akhila jantavah |   
Vibhootayo hareh etaah jagatah srushti hetavah || ***All these are the *vibhooti* or glory of *Vishnu* only; *Chaturmukha Brahma, **Daksha*, and others are responsible for creation, *kaala*, time, and all the  [[641]] beings - they are also doing creation at their own level. They are the cause of creation of this world. ***   


## 32
Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 32:    
Vishnuh manu aadayah kaalah sarva bhootaani cha dvija |   
Sthiteh nimitta bhootasya vishnoh etaah vibhootayah ||*** In the same way, for sustenance, *Vishnu* is responsible, *Manu* and others are also responsible, *kaala*, and all the beings are responsible. They are all the *amshaas* of *Bhagavaan* only. They are all the *vibhootis* of *Vishnu. **Haris* present as Inner Controller, *antaryaami* of all these, and He only gets all these done through them; they are responsible to do that, but the ultimate controller is *Bhagavaan* only. 



He is present in *Brahma, Vishnu* and *Maheshvara* and as *Vishnu* Himself. 





## 33
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 33:    
Rudrah kaala antakaadyaah cha samastaah cha eva jantavah |   
Chaturdhaa pralayaaya etaa janaardhana vibhootayah ||*** For *pralaya*, dissolution, *Rudra, kaala, Yama* and *Agni*, and all the beings, are the four parts. These are the *vibhootis* of *Bhagavaan* only, who are established in dissolution or destruction. 





## 34
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 34:    
Jagat aadou tathaa madhye srushtih aapralayaat dvija |   
Dhaatraa mareechih mishraih cha kriyate jantubhih tathaa ||*** At the beginning of the world, in the middle also, up to *pralaya*, creation is going on happening. This is happening by *Chaturmukha Brahma*, *Mareechi*, and the *Prajaapatis*, and also by all the beings. 



After *praakruta pralaya*, when creation happens, when the world is created newly, and from there, creation keeps on happening every *kalpa*, every *manvantara*, and is going on happening all the time. 





## 35
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 35:    
Brahmaa srujati aadikaale mareechi pramukhaah tatah |   
Utpaadayanti apatyaani jantavah cha pratikshanam || *** [[642]] At the very beginning of the *kalpa, Chaturmukha Brahma* does creation. After that, *Mareechi* and *prajaapatis* are established in creation. They create children. And the beings are creating every minute, every second. Every second someone is born. 



At the beginning of the *praakruta pralaya, Chaturmukha Brahma* is created. Every *kalpa* is like a day for *Chaturmukha Brahma*. 





## 36
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 36:    
Kaalena na vinaa brahmaa srushti nishpaadako dvija |   
Na prajaapatayah sarve na cha eva akhila jantavah ||*** *Kaala* is an important aspect of creation. Without *kaala's* help, either *Chaturmukha Brahma* or *Prajaapati* or all the beings - nobody can do creation. It all has to happen at a particular time. Time controls how long one stays, lives. At the end of their time, which is specified based on their karma, they have to die. 





## 37
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 37:    
Evam eva vibhaago ayam sthitou api upadishyate |   
Chaturdhaa tasya devasya maitreya pralaye tathaa ||*** In the same way, the divisions are all happening for sustenance also. In the same way, in four forms, *Rudra, Agni/Yama, Kaala*, and all the beings, dissolution is also happening all the time. 



Four broad divisions are told. *Chaturmukha Brahma* is the first to start creation. *Prajaapatis* play a vital role in creation; they have a lot of powers and capability. *Kaala* is an important part for everyone. And, all the beings are also there. In the same way, sustenance is happening by *Vishnu, **Manu* and others, *Kaala* and also all the beings. Destruction is happening by *Rudra, Agni/Yama, Kaala* and then all the beings. These are all *vibhootis* of *Vishnu*, the glory, *shareera* of *Vishnu*. Through them, *Vishnu* only is getting all these done. 





## 38
Having told that everything is *Bhagavaan's vibhooti*, now a very generic statement is told by *Paraasharar*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 38:  *** [[643]] ***Yat kinchit srujyate yena sattva jaatena vai dvija |   
Tasya srujyasya sambhootou tat sarvam vai hareh tanuh ||*** Whatever is created by whoever, that act of creation, and the thing that is created, everything is *Paramaatman's tanu, shareera*. 



This is one of the main *pramaanaas* for the *Shareera Shareeri bhaava*. This is quoted by *Bhaashyakaarar* and other *Aachaaryaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Etat uktam bhavati iti aaha - yat kinchit iti | Sambhootou iti nimitta   
saptami | Kaarya utpatti nimittam hi kaarana adhishtaanena hareh tat   
tat tanutvam |*** Here, *Sri Engal Aalwaan* also tells like *Bhaashyakaarar *- Having told a lot of things, things are told in summary. Everything is *Hari's* body, is told. How everything becomes His *shareera*, is because *Bhagavaan* is *antaryaami* of the *kaarana*, cause also. *Bhagavaan* is Inner Self, locus, Inner Controller of every cause. He gets creation done through those people being their *antaryaami*. For the sake of creating the effect, He is present as the locus, the cause. Because *Hari* is present as *antaryaami* of everything, everything becomes His *shareera, tanu*. 



*Etat uktam bhavati *- is a typical style of *Bhaashyakaarar*, in *Sri Bhaashya*. Whatever is summarized is expanded sometimes, or, whatever is told in great detail is summarized briefly. *Vistrutasya sangrahah. Sangraheetasya **vistaarah. * 





## 39
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 39:    
Hanti yaavat cha yat kinchit sattvam sthaavara jangamam |   
Janaardanasya tat roudram maitreya antakaram vapuh ||*** Whoever destroys or kills anything, whether movable or immovable, that *roudra* form of whatever is responsible for destruction, whether it is *Rudra, Agni/Yama*, or a particular being, it is the *roudra **roopa* of *Hari* only. *Bhagavaan* only is *antaryaami* of everything, so everything is said to be His *shareera, tanu, vapu*. 





## 40
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 40:  *** [[644]] ***Evam esha jagat srushtaa jagat paataa tathaa jagat |   
Jagat bhakshayitaa devah samastasya janaardanah || ***In this way, *Janaardana* is the creator of everything, He is the protector, He is responsible for dissolution, He eats everything, He keeps everything in Himself and protects it as a part of Him, inseparably associated with Him. He is none other than *Janaardana*. 



*Aazhvaar* very clearly says that He swallows and He again throws it out. This symbolically tells that He withdraws everything unto Himself, protects during *pralaya*, and again He creates. Everything is present in subtle form during *pralaya*, and comes to gross state during creation. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Evam iti | Samastasya devo janaardanah iti anvayah |*** 





## 41
Now, *Paraasharar* starts to tell about *mukta svaroopa*. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 41:    
Srushti sthiti antakaaleshu tridhaa evam sampravartate |   
Gunapravruttyaa paramam padam tasyaagunam mahat ||*** *Srushti, sthiti* and *anta *- it is happening in these three ways. In each of these, there are four forms. Through *sattva, rajas* and *tamas*. When *sattva* is high, He is responsible for sustenance. When *rajas* is high, creation happens. When *tamas* is high, destruction or dissolution happens. Due to the effects of the various *gunaas*, creation, sustenance and destruction happen. Everything is His *shareera, vibhooti*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Triguna vashyam roopam nigamayati srushti sthiti iti aarabhya guna   
pravrutti iti antena | Srushti iti | Srushti aadi kaaleshu guna   
pravruttyaa tridhaa bhootah, evam ukta prakaarena chaturbhedo   
vartate | Paramam ityaadi | Paramam virinchaadi padaat | Agunam   
gunamaya prakruti viyuktam | Mahat avyaktaat | Sarga sthiti   
antakaaleshu iti cha paathah |*** These are the forms of *Bhagavaan* which are under the sway of *triguna - **sattva, rajas, tamas. Chaturmukha Brahma* is also *trigunaatmaka. **Manu*, *Daksha prajaapatis, Yama, Agni *- all are *trigunaatmaka. Hari* being  [[645]] the *antaryaami*, all these denote the *antaryaami* also. Words which denote the *shareera* go up to the *shareeri* in *aparyavasaana vrutti*. All these *chetanaas* are *triguna vashyaas*. Though they are the *shareera* of Him, their defects don't touch Him. It is established in the *Vedaas* that He is *apahata paapma*. He is present as inseparably associated. Everything is His mode. It can be said that everything is Him only. *Srushti, sthiti* and *naasha* - are the three states. In these three states, He is present in four different forms. That was told so far, and is concluded here. It is superior to *Chaturmukha Brahma* and the *devaas. Aguna* means not that it is without any attribute or quality, but that it is separated from the three qualities of *prakruti, sattva, rajas* and *tamas*. It is superior to unmanifest or *avyakta*. 





## 42
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 42:    
Tat cha jnyaanamayam vyaapi sva samvedyam \(noo\) anoupamam |   
Chatushprakaaram tat api svaroopam paramaatmanah || ***It is abundance of consciousness. Pervading is through consciousness. It is self revealed. This *pada*, which is attained, is *mukta svaroopa*. This is also told as *Paramaatma svaroopa* because it is also a *visheshana* of *Paramaatman* only. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Tat cha iti | Jnyaanamayam jnyaana prachuram | Vyaapi jnyaanena |

shabdo roopa vachanah | Svam roopam hi svaroopam | ***Abundance of consciousness. *Mayat pratyaya* is in *praachurya*, abundance. Here, *Paramapada* told is *mukta svaroopa*, the essential nature of *mukta*. This is also of four forms. *Mukta svaroopa* is *jnyaanamaya*, it has abundance of consciousness; it is *vyaapi*, it is all pervading due to attributive consciousness; it is *sva samvedya*, it knows itself, it reveals to itself; it is *anoupamam*, incomparable. 



*Paramapada* is a word used to describe three different things. One is *Paramaatman. Padyate iti padam *- that which is attained.  [[646]] A *mukta* attains *Paramaatman*; he goes to *Paramapada* and then attains *Paramaatman. Paramapada* is also a *sthaana*, the abode of *Vishnu. **Mukta svaroopa* is also *Paramapada*, because the *jeevaatman* attains his original full form, which is also a thing that he attains. This is also explained in *Vedaartha Sangraha* by *Bhaashyakaarar. Roopa* is also *paryaapa **pada* for *shareera. Vapu, tanu, shareera, roopa, amsha, vibhooti *- are all *paryaaya padaas*, they all denote *shareera shareeri bhaava* which is explained by *Bhaashyakaarar* very clearly. 



*Shareera shareeri bhaava* has three relationships - *aadhaara-aadheya, **niyaamaka-niyaamya, sheshi-shesha. Shareera* is told in various *pramaanaas, **Shrutis, Smrutis*, using various words - *amsha, vibhooti, vapu, roopa, tanu, **shareera*. 



Now, *Maitreyar* asks about those four forms 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying the last chapter of *Amsha* 1, Chapter 22, where *Paraasharar* is telling how everything is *Bhagavaan's roopa, Vishnu's* form only. *Vishnu* only is present as everything, whatever is created, everything is His *shareera*, depending on Him, supported by Him, and ruled by Him. Here, the words *tanu, vapu* are used, and everything is *Bhagavaan's shareera*, as per the *shareera shareeri **bhaava*, very clearly established by *Bhagavad Ramanuja* and our *poorva **aachaaryaas*. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Triguna vashyam roopam nigamayati srushti sthiti iti aarabhya guna

antakaaleshu iti cha paathah |*** The forms of *Bhagavaan* present in *prakruti mandala*, due to the *karma*, being associated with *prakruti*, which is *triguna*, associated with *sattva, **rajas, tamas*. That form having concluded, *Paraasharar* now starts to tell  [[647]] about the *mukta aatma svaroopa*. 





## 42
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 42:    
Tat cha jnyaanamayam vyaapi sva samvedyam \(noo\) anoupamam |   
Chatushprakaaram tat api svaroopam paramaatmanah ||*** Having told that everything that is created, that is coming under creation is *Bhagavaan's roopa* only, His form, *shareera, Paraasharar* continues to say that even the *mukta aatma svaroopa*, the essential nature of liberated self, is also *Bhagavaan's* form only. *Paramaatman* is only present in this form. The *mukta aatma svaroopa* is also His *prakaara* being His *shareera* only. It is present in four modes - *chatushprakaara*. This *mukta aatma svaroopa* can know itself. *Jeevaatman* has knowership. *Vyaapi* means that in the liberated state, it is all pervading with respect to the *dharma bhoota jnyaana*. It is *jnyaana prachura*, with abundance of consciousness. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

Now, *Maitreyar* asks *Sri Paraasharar* to explain the four *prakaaraas*. 





## 43
***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 22, Shloka 43:    
Maitreyah -   
Chatushprakaarataam tasya \(jnyaana\) brahma bhootasya vai mune |   
Mamaachakshva yathaanyaayam yat uktam param padam ||*** *Maitreya *- The four forms - which is also a *Paramaatman's* form, the *mukta **svaroopa*, which is attained by the *jeevaatmans* when they get dissociated from *prakruti*, when they will be present in their original form, when the *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is in its original state. That is of four stages or modes. 



In this world, whatever we desire to possess, accomplish, that object which we desire to accomplish is the *saadhya*, goal to be accomplished; *saadhya* is  [[648]] that which is achieved or attained. The means to acquire that goal is called *saadhana*. The *saadhya* and *saadhana* are of several varieties, based on the desire of each person and the means to attain them. In this context, the *saadhya* for a *yogi* who desires to get rid of *samsaara* is the *mukta **aatma svaroopa*. He is in bound state and wants to attain liberated state. Bound state is associated with *prakruti* due to *karma*; now he wants to get rid of this, put an end to the birth and death cycle, and and attain the state of liberation. The *mukta aatma svaroopa* is separated from *prakruti **sambandha*. That *mukta aatma svaroopa* is called *Brahman* here; this is also a form of *Brahman*. In order to attain this *aatma svaroopa*, the *saadhana* is *praanaayaama* and such things, and this is told in the *yoga **shaastra*; this knowledge comes from study of *yoga shaastra*. Knowledge of the *praanaayaama* and such *saadhana*, which is about the *mukta aatma **svaroopa*, who is *jnyaana maya*, is the first *bheda*, first part. Knowledge about *mukta aatma svaroopa* which is *saadhya*, which comes from this *saadhana*, after adopting the means, *praanaayama*, etc., is the second *bheda*, second part, which comes from the *shaastra *- this is *shaastra **janya jnyaana*. After this, merging the *saadhya* and *saadhana bhaava **sambandha*, the knowledge of *shuddha aatma svaroopa*, which is without the differentiation of *deva, manushya*, etc., arises; this has the abundance of *aatma svaroopa jnyaana*, which is known as *dhyaana*; this is the third *bheda*. Then comes *aatma saakshaatkaara*. The *bhedaas* are knowledge of *saadhana*, knowledge of *saadhya*, getting rid of differentiation between *deva manushya* and others through *dhyaana*, then *aatma **saakshaatkaara*. In the *aatma saakshaatkaara* stage, the *yogi* does not consider any of the *saadhya saadhana* aspects as they are all opposed to *aatma avalokana*; he will be only in the experience of *aatma avalokana*, and fully immersed in *aatma avalokana*; all thoughts of all other aspects are rejected and only *aatma avalokana* ensues. This *aatma **svaroopa* is *nirvyaapaara*. The object of experience in this stage is *aatman*, and in this stage, thoughts of *saadhana, anushthaana* are all absent, as the *yogi* has already reached the stage of perception of self experience. This is the gist of the *shlokaas* which we are studying now. ***

That which is going to be attained is said to be *paramam brahma*, the *mukta aatma **svaroopa* separated from *prakruti sambandha*, from which he does not return back. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

It is told that *Hari* only is everything and *prakruti* and *purusha* are all said to be *Brahma* only, because they are all modes of *Brahma. Brahma* only is present in all those forms. When *prakruti purusha* is itself told as *Brahma*, the *mukta svaroopa* is superior to that, and is told as *Paramam Brahma*. These words - the meanings have to be understood according to context. ***

Aatma **svaroopa* is similar everywhere. This is the third part. The differences which we see here, are because of *deva, manushya*, etc., which are forms of *prakruti*. All *jeevaatmans* inside are *jnyaana svaroopa*, there is *aatma **aatma saamya*, is the *advaita* told here.

Before this, everything is told as *Bhagavaan's roopa, tanu*. So, it is always associated with *Paramaatman*. This *aatma svaroopa saakshaatkaara*, is not *kaivalya*, it is not without *Paramaatman*, it is experiencing it as *shareera* of *Paramaatman*, with *apruthak siddha sambandha*. That is why it is told that he does not return back. This is the real *aatma **svaroopa* experienced as being subservient to *Paramaatman*, ever associated with *Paramaatman*. This is understood here, as this is what is being told. 



Perceiving the self directly, putting an end to all these conceptions of *saadhana, saadhya*, etc., one attains *aatma saakshaatkaara*.

|*** The last stage is *samaadhi*. When one has reached the state of *samaadhi*, if one is thinking about other things - *saadhana, saadhya*, etc., it is actually opposed to experience of the self. For one who has achieved *samaadhi*, thinking of other things is opposed to *aatma avalokana*. Not thinking about anything else, is said to be the path to attaining *aatma saakshaatkaara*. One who is perceiving the *aatma svaroopa*, the nature of that *aatma svaroopa*, the object of that perception, is going to be told here. *Nirvyaapaara* means that there is no *saadhana anushthaana. Anaakhyeya* means that form, class, differentiation is not there. *Vyaapti maatram* means that the *dharma **bhoota jnyaana* which is *sankuchita*, contracted due to *karma*, becomes fully evolved when the *karma bandha* is removed; it becomes all pervasive. *Anoopamam* means without comparison. *Aatma sambodha **vishayam* means that it knows about itself. *Sattaa maatram* means that it is just present, without the *shat bhaava vikaaraas* of *asti, jaayate, vardhate, **viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*; it is just said to be *sat. **Alakshanam* means it cannot be inferred through something else; we infer fire on seeing smoke, this is not like that; cannot be inferred through logic or inference.

Durvibhaavyam* means it cannot be established through logic, or cannot imagine a form for the *mukta aatma **svaroopa*.

It is in the field of *samsaara* where the seeds are sown, *jeevaatmans* are going from birth to birth just like the seeds which are sown in the field of *samsaara*. For the *mukta aatmans*, this is not there.

Jeeva* who is qualified by the body - the embodied soul, and the liberated soul - both are included in the  [[657]] word *jagat* here. In the second *adhyaaya* of *Brahma Sutraas* while commenting on Sri *Bhaashya*, in the Third *Paada*, the *Sutra* 45 is *Prakaashaadivattu naivam parah*. This *adhikarana* is known as the *Amshaadhikarana*, where it is established that all *chetana achetana* are in *visheshya-visheshana amsha, Paramaatman* is *visheshya*, and is different and distinct. So, the *svaroopa* and *svabhaava* of *chetana achetana* are very different and distinct from *Paramaatman. Prakaasha* becomes the *amsha* of *Aaditya* and *Agni*. A qualified object, quality of the attribute is called *amsha*. This *shloka* is quoted in *Sutra* 3.46 of *Sri Bhaashya*, just like the brightness and object, *shakti* and that which has the *shakti*, is nothing but the *shareera aatma bhaava, amsha amshi bhaava. **Jagat* is *Paramaatman's amsha*, and He is *amshi. Jagat* is *Paramaatman's **shareera* and He is *aatma*. This is also quoted by *Sri Engal Aalwaan* here to show that this is a very important *pramaana* for our *siddhaanta*.

It will be told that there is difference in *dharma bhoota jnyaana* of various beings. That which is closer to the fire and that which is a little far away from the fire; the brightness reduces as the distance increases from the source of the light, and it is more near the source of the light. There is a difference in the brightness, and there is a differentiation in *Paramaatman's **shakti* also. *Paramaatman's shakti* is nothing but *jagat*, His *shareera. **Jagat* includes the embodied souls and liberated souls.

All the sub varieties of that *shakti* will be told here, starting with *Brahma, Vishnu* and *Shiva*. Among the *shaktis* told, *Brahma, Vishnu, **Shiva* are the prominent of primary *shaktis*. Compared to these *Chaturmukha Brahma* and *Shiva, devaas* such as *Daksha* and others, are inferior in terms of *jnyaana* and *shakti*.

Whereas *Bhagavaan* incarnates Himself as *Vishnu*, among the Trinity. So, *Vishnu* is His own *avataara*. What is going to be told for various kinds of beings, how there is a difference in their *jnyaana* and *shakti*, is told. Initially it was told that in the stage of *aatma svaroopa aavirbhaava* in the *dhyaana* state, all these differences disappear, and *aatma aatma **saamya* was told. The *taaratamya* which is told here - that one is more and one is less, is due to the karma and the *dharma bhoota jnyaana* and not in the *svaroopa*. *Svaroopa* is same for all the *aatmans*; all are *jnyaana aananda **svaroopa*. Differences that are told in *jnyaana* are because they are covered by *karma*; that is why one has more *jnyaana* and another has less *jnyaana. **Chaturmukha Brahma* has more *jnyaana*, his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is more expanded, compared to *Daksha* and others. 



This is a very important *pramaana* in *Vishnu Puraana* which our *Aachaaryaas* quote, to show that the *dharma bhoota jnyaana* undergoes contraction and expansion.  [[659]] 



***Recap***: In the previous session, we were studying the last chapter of *Amsha* 1, Chapter 22, where everything that is created is *Bhagavaan's **vibhooti* only, the *moorta* and *amoorta roopa* of *Bhagavaan*, which was told by *Sri Paraasharar*. ***

As the brightness spreads all over, from the fire which is located in one place; the brightness is very much a part of the fire, but it is different compared to the fire itself; it is like the attribute of the fire. In the same way, the entire world is *shakti* of *Paramaatman*; the *baddhaas* and *muktaas* are both included in the *jagat*. In this world, we have all beings who are embodied souls and there are liberated selves in *Paramapada*. These embodied souls and liberated selves are like *shakti* of *Paramaatman*; like the brightness of fire; they are inseparably associated with *Paramaatman*; this is being told here.

There is a difference among all beings starting from *Chaturmukha Brahma*, and up to the *sthaavaraas*, the lowest of the beings. In some it is more, and in some it is less.

Among the trinity, *Vishnu* is a direct *avataara* of *Paramaatman* Himself. *Devaas*, other gods are lower, inferior compared to them \( *Brahma, Vishnu* and *Shiva*\), means that with respect to knowledge and capability or powers. Compared to *Devaas, Daksha **Prajaapati* and others are having still lesser knowledge and powers. This is an important explanation in the commentary - that the *taaratamya *\(difference\) which is told, why is there this difference - because the nature of all these embodied souls is that they are all *jeevaatman*, except *Vishnu* who is an *avataara* of *Paramaatman* Himself. All embodied souls in their essential nature are all the same, *jnyaana **svaroopa*, though they are different beings. The *taaratamya* is in the *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and why is this difference coming - this difference is because of the *karmaas*, the respective *karmaas* of those individual selves. One individual self becomes *Chaturmukha Brahma*, another one becomes *Shiva*, another *Indra, Varuna, Daksha Prajaapati*, etc., they are all created like this, and the difference in their attributive knowledge is because of karma done in their previous births. The *dharma **bhoota jnyaana* in the original state is fully evolved for everyone, whereas here, it is hidden or covered by the karma. When the *karma bandhana* goes, they get liberated, and the *dharma bhoota jnyaana* shines forth in its original state; it is not created at that time, but it just exists in its natural state. It is not due to *svaroopa* but due to *karma* that there is difference in *dharma bhoota jnyaana* of these individual selves.

The animals, deer and others, cow and others, birds and snakes are having still less. Comparatively, each has lesser and lesser knowledge and powers. Compared to them, still less is there in trees, herbs, etc. 



In *Vedaartha Sangraha, Sri Bhaashyakaarar* says that anything which has name and form can have a *jeevaatman* in it. But its *dharma bhoota **jnyaana* will be so less that it does not exhibit that kind of knowledge.

Means that it is endless, His form is never-ending, there are innumerable beings in this world. The number of individual souls cannot be counted, they are innumerable. They are called *nitya* because they are all created, but existing in the *kaarana*. The *kaarya* or effect exists in the *kaarana* which is the cause, this is called *satkaaryavaada*. In this case, all the *chetana achetanaatmaka prapancha* is existing in the *sookshma **roopa*, subtle form in *Bhagavaan* during *pralaya*; at that time, there is no name and form differentiation; when creation happens, they all come into the gross state; so the *kaarya* actually exists in the *kaarana*; because there is unbroken chain of creation, sustenance and dissolution - these are going on happening without any break. Another way to tell *nityatva* is *pravaaha **nityatva*, because there is on Indra or Agni or *Varuna* or *Chaturmukha **Brahma* all the time. If the time of one *Chaturmukha Brahma* gets over,  [[663]] another being comes into that position; this is called *pravaaha nityatva. **Aavirbhaava* and *tirobhaava* means *sankocha* and *vikaasa*, increase or reduction in *dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and this itself is told as *janma* and *naasha*, birth and death.

It is told in the last Chapter of *Brahma Sutraas*, the Fourth *Adhyaaya*, where, when the *karma **bandha* goes, the *jeevaatman's dharma bhoota jnyaana* expands, becomes all pervasive and shines forth in its original state; there is a doubt put there whether it is newly created; an example is given, just like a gem is there covered by dust, when the dust is removed, the gem shines forth by itself; this shining is not newly created; it is already present in the gem; this is the very nature of the gem itself; it is not seen because it is covered by dust; when the dust is removed, it shines forth in its natural state; in the same  [[667]] way, when the *jeevaatman* whose *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is covered or hidden by the *karmaas*, when the *karma bandha* is removed, his *dharma **bhoota jnyaana* becomes all pervasive; it shines forth in its natural state and is not newly created. For this, this *shloka* is told - just as the brightness is not created for a gem when it is cleaned up, so jeevaatman is mani saamya, similarity is shown with a gem which has that kind of shine. There is a Brahma Sutra, *Gunaat vaa aalokavat*; there is an *Upanishadic mantra* which says - *Sa cha aanantyaaya kalpate*; he becomes *ananta* not in his *svaroopa* but in his *dharma*. The *aanantya* is in his *dharma bhoota **jnyaana*, the all pervasiveness that he achieves is in his attributive consciousness; like the brightness of a light which is hidden, when the block is removed, the light shines forth everywhere. Because of this, the *koustubha mani saamya* is told for the *jeevaatmans*. The word *aatmaanam* is told, in singular; it is not one *aatma*, but it is the entire collectivity of the *aatmans*; or it can be the class of *aatmans* told. ***

From the *taamasa ahamkaara*, the *pancha **tanmaatraas* and *pancha bhootaas* are created; this is said to be *bhootaadi. **Bhootaadi* is *taamasa ahamkaara; indriyaadi* is *saatvika ahamkaara *- these two *tattvaas *- He supports them as *Shankha *\(conch\) and *Shaarnga *\(Divine Bow\), which are present in *Bhagavaan's* divine form.

So, the mind moves in such speed, does not stay firm; this is why concentrating on one object is so difficult, and has to be practiced through *yoga*; mind moves faster than *Vaayu*. In His divine hand, *Bhagavaan* is holding the *Sudarshana Chakra*.

*Bhaashyakaarar* says that the *lakshana* for *shareera* is that it is a *dravya*. How can *shabda* be called as *vapu*, because *shabda* is not a *dravya*. This is explained as *Vedaabhimaani devataa*. For all these, there are *abhimaani **devataas*. When we say *vapu, shareera*, the *abhimaani devataas* are to be taken. This is how it is explained. All the *Vedaas* are supported by *Bhagavaan* only, as *Swami Deshikan* says. During *praakruta pralaya*, even *Chaturmukha Brahma* does not exist. *Vedaas* are said to be *nitya*, and are said be there in *Bhagavaan's jnyaana*. When *Bhagvaan* does the *srushti* again, *Bhagavaan* teaches *Chaturmukha Brahma*, in the same way as it was earlier. This *nityatva* is what makes the *Vedaas apourusheya*. Then *Chaturmukha Brahma* teaches to all the *rishis*. He also creates the *rishis* based on the previous *karmaas, sukrutaas*, by which they do *tapas* and *saakshaatkaara* of *Veda bhaagaas*. So, *Vedaas* are all existing as it is, and is not created by *Bhagavaan*; but He does *upadesha. Vedaas* will always be there in *Bhagavaan's jnyaana*, in the same form all the time, and will never change; the order is most important. *Bhaashyakaarar* says in *Vedaartha Sangraha* that the *loukika shabdaas* and *Vaidika shabdaas* are all coming from *Vedaas* only. The difference is that in the *loukika shabdaas*, there is no *aanupoorvi nityatva*, no *krama nityatva*. Whereas *Vedaas* are always being taught in the same order, in the *guru shishya paramparaa*.
