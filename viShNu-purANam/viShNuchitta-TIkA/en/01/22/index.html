Words which denote the <em>shareera</em> go up to the <em>shareeri</em> in <em>aparyavasaana vrutti</em>. All these <em>chetanaas</em> are <em>triguna vashyaas</em>. Though they are the <em>shareera</em> of Him, their defects don&rsquo;t touch Him. It is established in the <em>Vedaas</em> that He is <em>apahata paapma</em>. He is present as inseparably associated. Everything is His mode. It can be said that everything is Him only. <em>Srushti, sthiti</em> and <em>naasha</em> - are the three states. In these three states, He is present in four different forms. That was told so far, and is concluded here. It is superior to <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and the <em>devaas. Aguna</em> means not that it is without any attribute or quality, but that it is separated from the three qualities of <em>prakruti, sattva, rajas</em> and <em>tamas</em>. It is superior to unmanifest or <em>avyakta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Paramapada</em> is a word used to describe three different things. One is *Paramaatman. Padyate iti padam *- that which is attained.  [[646]] A <em>mukta</em> attains <em>Paramaatman</em>; he goes to <em>Paramapada</em> and then attains <em>Paramaatman. Paramapada</em> is also a <em>sthaana</em>, the abode of *Vishnu. *<em>Mukta svaroopa</em> is also <em>Paramapada</em>, because the <em>jeevaatman</em> attains his original full form, which is also a thing that he attains. This is also explained in <em>Vedaartha Sangraha</em> by <em>Bhaashyakaarar. Roopa</em> is also *paryaapa *<em>pada</em> for *shareera. Vapu, tanu, shareera, roopa, amsha, vibhooti *- are all <em>paryaaya padaas</em>, they all denote <em>shareera shareeri bhaava</em> which is explained by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> very clearly.</p>
<p><em>Shareera shareeri bhaava</em> has three relationships - *aadhaara-aadheya, *<em>niyaamaka-niyaamya, sheshi-shesha. Shareera</em> is told in various *pramaanaas, *<em>Shrutis, Smrutis</em>, using various words - *amsha, vibhooti, vapu, roopa, tanu, *<em>shareera</em>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying the last chapter of <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 22, where <em>Paraasharar</em> is telling how everything is <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s roopa, Vishnu&rsquo;s</em> form only. <em>Vishnu</em> only is present as everything, whatever is created, everything is His <em>shareera</em>, depending on Him, supported by Him, and ruled by Him. Here, the words <em>tanu, vapu</em> are used, and everything is <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s shareera</em>, as per the *shareera shareeri *<em>bhaava</em>, very clearly established by <em>Bhagavad Ramanuja</em> and our *poorva *<em>aachaaryaas</em>.</p>

That is of four stages or modes.</p>
<p>In this world, whatever we desire to possess, accomplish, that object which we desire to accomplish is the <em>saadhya</em>, goal to be accomplished; <em>saadhya</em> is  [[648]] that which is achieved or attained. The means to acquire that goal is called <em>saadhana</em>. The <em>saadhya</em> and <em>saadhana</em> are of several varieties, based on the desire of each person and the means to attain them. In this context, the <em>saadhya</em> for a <em>yogi</em> who desires to get rid of <em>samsaara</em> is the *mukta *<em>aatma svaroopa</em>. He is in bound state and wants to attain liberated state. Bound state is associated with <em>prakruti</em> due to <em>karma</em>; now he wants to get rid of this, put an end to the birth and death cycle, and and attain the state of liberation. The <em>mukta aatma svaroopa</em> is separated from *prakruti *<em>sambandha</em>. That <em>mukta aatma svaroopa</em> is called <em>Brahman</em> here; this is also a form of <em>Brahman</em>. In order to attain this <em>aatma svaroopa</em>, the <em>saadhana</em> is <em>praanaayaama</em> and such things, and this is told in the *yoga *<em>shaastra</em>; this knowledge comes from study of <em>yoga shaastra</em>. Knowledge of the <em>praanaayaama</em> and such <em>saadhana</em>, which is about the *mukta aatma *<em>svaroopa</em>, who is <em>jnyaana maya</em>, is the first <em>bheda</em>, first part. Knowledge about <em>mukta aatma svaroopa</em> which is <em>saadhya</em>, which comes from this <em>saadhana</em>, after adopting the means, <em>praanaayama</em>, etc., is the second <em>bheda</em>, second part, which comes from the *shaastra *- this is *shaastra *<em>janya jnyaana</em>. After this, merging the <em>saadhya</em> and *saadhana bhaava *<em>sambandha</em>, the knowledge of <em>shuddha aatma svaroopa</em>, which is without the differentiation of <em>deva, manushya</em>, etc., arises; this has the abundance of <em>aatma svaroopa jnyaana</em>, which is known as <em>dhyaana</em>; this is the third <em>bheda</em>. Then comes <em>aatma saakshaatkaara</em>. The <em>bhedaas</em> are knowledge of <em>saadhana</em>, knowledge of <em>saadhya</em>, getting rid of differentiation between <em>deva manushya</em> and others through <em>dhyaana</em>, then *aatma *<em>saakshaatkaara</em>. In the <em>aatma saakshaatkaara</em> stage, the <em>yogi</em> does not consider any of the <em>saadhya saadhana</em> aspects as they are all opposed to <em>aatma avalokana</em>; he will be only in the experience of <em>aatma avalokana</em>, and fully immersed in <em>aatma avalokana</em>; all thoughts of all other aspects are rejected and only <em>aatma avalokana</em> ensues. This *aatma *<em>svaroopa</em> is <em>nirvyaapaara</em>. The object of experience in this stage is <em>aatman</em>, and in this stage, thoughts of <em>saadhana, anushthaana</em> are all absent, as the <em>yogi</em> has already reached the stage of perception of self experience. This is the gist of the <em>shlokaas</em> which we are studying now. ***</p>

There is a difference between <em>prabhaa</em> and <em>prabhaavat</em>. From this, the relationship between the *chetana achetana *- this whole world which is said to be <em>shakti</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, and <em>Paramaatman</em>, is told as brightness and fire. <em>Bhagavaan</em> is in the place of <em>prabhaavat</em>, and the whole world is in the place of brightness, <em>prabhaa, jyotsnaa</em>. Difference between the <em>Paramaatman</em> and the world is told clearly here. This <em>pramaana</em> is used by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> in <em>Sri Bhaashya</em>, which is quoted by *Sri Engal *<em>Aalwaan</em> here. What is established by <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> in <em>Sri Bhaashya</em> is that the source of light and its brightness, are different and distinct, though they are inseparably associated. <em>Jagat</em> includes the <em>jeevaatman</em> who is having the <em>shareera</em> here, and also the <em>mukta aatma. Jeeva</em> who is qualified by the body - the embodied soul, and the liberated soul - both are included in the  [[657]] word <em>jagat</em> here. In the second <em>adhyaaya</em> of <em>Brahma Sutraas</em> while commenting on Sri <em>Bhaashya</em>, in the Third <em>Paada</em>, the <em>Sutra</em> 45 is <em>Prakaashaadivattu naivam parah</em>. This <em>adhikarana</em> is known as the <em>Amshaadhikarana</em>, where it is established that all <em>chetana achetana</em> are in <em>visheshya-visheshana amsha, Paramaatman</em> is <em>visheshya</em>, and is different and distinct. So, the <em>svaroopa</em> and <em>svabhaava</em> of <em>chetana achetana</em> are very different and distinct from <em>Paramaatman. Prakaasha</em> becomes the <em>amsha</em> of <em>Aaditya</em> and <em>Agni</em>. A qualified object, quality of the attribute is called <em>amsha</em>. This <em>shloka</em> is quoted in <em>Sutra</em> 3.46 of <em>Sri Bhaashya</em>, just like the brightness and object, <em>shakti</em> and that which has the <em>shakti</em>, is nothing but the *shareera aatma bhaava, amsha amshi bhaava. *<em>Jagat</em> is <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s amsha</em>, and He is <em>amshi. Jagat</em> is *Paramaatman&rsquo;s *<em>shareera</em> and He is <em>aatma</em>. This is also quoted by <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> here to show that this is a very important <em>pramaana</em> for our <em>siddhaanta</em>.</p>

Whereas <em>Bhagavaan</em> incarnates Himself as <em>Vishnu</em>, among the Trinity. So, <em>Vishnu</em> is His own <em>avataara</em>. What is going to be told for various kinds of beings, how there is a difference in their <em>jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em>, is told. Initially it was told that in the stage of <em>aatma svaroopa aavirbhaava</em> in the <em>dhyaana</em> state, all these differences disappear, and *aatma aatma *<em>saamya</em> was told. The <em>taaratamya</em> which is told here - that one is more and one is less, is due to the karma and the <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> and not in the <em>svaroopa</em>. <em>Svaroopa</em> is same for all the <em>aatmans</em>; all are *jnyaana aananda *<em>svaroopa</em>. Differences that are told in <em>jnyaana</em> are because they are covered by <em>karma</em>; that is why one has more <em>jnyaana</em> and another has less *jnyaana. *<em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> has more <em>jnyaana</em>, his <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> is more expanded, compared to <em>Daksha</em> and others.</p>
<p>This is a very important <em>pramaana</em> in <em>Vishnu Puraana</em> which our <em>Aachaaryaas</em> quote, to show that the <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> undergoes contraction and expansion.  [[659]]</p>

As the brightness spreads all over, from the fire which is located in one place; the brightness is very much a part of the fire, but it is different compared to the fire itself; it is like the attribute of the fire. In the same way, the entire world is <em>shakti</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>; the <em>baddhaas</em> and <em>muktaas</em> are both included in the <em>jagat</em>. In this world, we have all beings who are embodied souls and there are liberated selves in <em>Paramapada</em>. These embodied souls and liberated selves are like <em>shakti</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>; like the brightness of fire; they are inseparably associated with <em>Paramaatman</em>; this is being told here.</p>

Among the trinity, <em>Vishnu</em> is a direct <em>avataara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em> Himself. <em>Devaas</em>, other gods are lower, inferior compared to them ( <em>Brahma, Vishnu</em> and <em>Shiva</em>), means that with respect to knowledge and capability or powers. Compared to *Devaas, Daksha *<em>Prajaapati</em> and others are having still lesser knowledge and powers. This is an important explanation in the commentary - that the *taaratamya *(difference) which is told, why is there this difference - because the nature of all these embodied souls is that they are all <em>jeevaatman</em>, except <em>Vishnu</em> who is an <em>avataara</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em> Himself. All embodied souls in their essential nature are all the same, *jnyaana *<em>svaroopa</em>, though they are different beings. The <em>taaratamya</em> is in the <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, and why is this difference coming - this difference is because of the <em>karmaas</em>, the respective <em>karmaas</em> of those individual selves. One individual self becomes <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, another one becomes <em>Shiva</em>, another <em>Indra, Varuna, Daksha Prajaapati</em>, etc., they are all created like this, and the difference in their attributive knowledge is because of karma done in their previous births. The *dharma *<em>bhoota jnyaana</em> in the original state is fully evolved for everyone, whereas here, it is hidden or covered by the karma. When the <em>karma bandhana</em> goes, they get liberated, and the <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> shines forth in its original state; it is not created at that time, but it just exists in its natural state. It is not due to <em>svaroopa</em> but due to <em>karma</em> that there is difference in <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> of these individual selves.</p>

Another way to tell <em>nityatva</em> is *pravaaha *<em>nityatva</em>, because there is on Indra or Agni or <em>Varuna</em> or *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> all the time. If the time of one <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> gets over,  [[663]] another being comes into that position; this is called *pravaaha nityatva. *<em>Aavirbhaava</em> and <em>tirobhaava</em> means <em>sankocha</em> and <em>vikaasa</em>, increase or reduction in <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em>, and this itself is told as <em>janma</em> and <em>naasha</em>, birth and death.</p>

For this, this <em>shloka</em> is told - just as the brightness is not created for a gem when it is cleaned up, so jeevaatman is mani saamya, similarity is shown with a gem which has that kind of shine. There is a Brahma Sutra, <em>Gunaat vaa aalokavat</em>; there is an <em>Upanishadic mantra</em> which says - <em>Sa cha aanantyaaya kalpate</em>; he becomes <em>ananta</em> not in his <em>svaroopa</em> but in his <em>dharma</em>. The <em>aanantya</em> is in his *dharma bhoota *<em>jnyaana</em>, the all pervasiveness that he achieves is in his attributive consciousness; like the brightness of a light which is hidden, when the block is removed, the light shines forth everywhere. Because of this, the <em>koustubha mani saamya</em> is told for the <em>jeevaatmans</em>. The word <em>aatmaanam</em> is told, in singular; it is not one <em>aatma</em>, but it is the entire collectivity of the <em>aatmans</em>; or it can be the class of <em>aatmans</em> told. ***</p>

<p><em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> says that the <em>lakshana</em> for <em>shareera</em> is that it is a <em>dravya</em>. How can <em>shabda</em> be called as <em>vapu</em>, because <em>shabda</em> is not a <em>dravya</em>. This is explained as <em>Vedaabhimaani devataa</em>. For all these, there are *abhimaani *<em>devataas</em>. When we say <em>vapu, shareera</em>, the <em>abhimaani devataas</em> are to be taken. This is how it is explained. All the <em>Vedaas</em> are supported by <em>Bhagavaan</em> only, as <em>Swami Deshikan</em> says. During <em>praakruta pralaya</em>, even <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> does not exist. <em>Vedaas</em> are said to be <em>nitya</em>, and are said be there in <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s jnyaana</em>. When <em>Bhagvaan</em> does the <em>srushti</em> again, <em>Bhagavaan</em> teaches <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, in the same way as it was earlier. This <em>nityatva</em> is what makes the <em>Vedaas apourusheya</em>. Then <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> teaches to all the <em>rishis</em>. He also creates the <em>rishis</em> based on the previous <em>karmaas, sukrutaas</em>, by which they do <em>tapas</em> and <em>saakshaatkaara</em> of <em>Veda bhaagaas</em>. So, <em>Vedaas</em> are all existing as it is, and is not created by <em>Bhagavaan</em>; but He does <em>upadesha. Vedaas</em> will always be there in <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s jnyaana</em>, in the same form all the time, and will never change; the order is most important. <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> says in <em>Vedaartha Sangraha</em> that the <em>loukika shabdaas</em> and <em>Vaidika shabdaas</em> are all coming from <em>Vedaas</em> only. The difference is that in the <em>loukika shabdaas</em>, there is no <em>aanupoorvi nityatva</em>, no <em>krama nityatva</em>. Whereas <em>Vedaas</em> are always being taught in the same order, in the <em>guru shishya paramparaa</em>.</p>
