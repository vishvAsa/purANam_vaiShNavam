<p>In this, there is a lot of reference from <em>Saankhya kaarikaa</em>, the 47th <em>kaarikaa</em>. Five types of <em>avidyaa</em> are told - *avidyaa, asmitaa, raaga, *<em>dvesha, abhinivesha</em>. The effect of this is *tamas, moha, mahaa moha, *<em>taamisra</em> and <em>andha taamisra.

They are all synonyms of <em>avidyaa</em> only, neiscience.  [[189]]</p>

In the order of diminutive knowledge, (i) <em>vruksha</em>, the <em>guna</em> is <em>tamas</em>, (ii) bushes, it is <em>moha</em>, (iii) twiners, it is *mahaa moha *(iv) small plants, it is *tamisra *(v) grass, it is <em>andha tamisra</em>. He was not very much awake. He started to do <em>sankalpa</em>, but was not fully awake, so <em>tamas</em> was abundant; this is when <em>vruksha</em> and others were created. The vegetation - there is no knowledge inside and outside; outside sound and others, and inside <em>sukha</em> and <em>dukha</em>, knowledge is not there; very minute knowledge is there. That <em>vruksha</em>, etc. have little bit of knowledge is well known, because they drink water; and grow a branch which is cut off, there is milk produced from the tree, all this indicates that there is some <em>jnyaatrutva</em>. Being enveloped by great <em>tamas</em>, they were all created.</p>

putravatvaadi sambandha anabhijnyaah |</strong></em> Egotism, due to having the idea of <em>aatman</em> in the body, eighteen types of impairment of senses are told in the *Vaayu Puraana *- deafness, defects of the skin, eye defects such a going blind, losing sense of taste, losing sense of smell, dumbness, defects of hands, legs, defects related to rectum, and so on. These are all impairments of the senses. Twenty eight forms of imperfections are 11 types of impairments of the senses, and 17 types of impairment in <em>buddhi</em>. Nine types of contentment are four internal ( <em>aadhyaatimika, prakruti, upaadaana, kaala, bhaagya</em>) and five external ( <em>baahya</em>), due to abstinence from sense objects. The nine kinds of <em>tushti</em>, contentment are *prakruti, upaadaana, kaala, bhaagya, aarjana, rakshana, *<em>kshaya, sanga, himsaa</em>. Eight kinds of <em>siddhi</em> are <em>ooha, shabda, adhyayana</em>, prevention of three kinds of *dukha - aadhyaatmika, aadhibhoutika, *<em>aadhidaivika</em>, and <em>suhrutpraapti</em> and <em>daana</em>. There are seventeen types of imperfections of <em>buddhi</em>.</p>
<p>The nine types of contentment are explained thus:  [[194]]  If <em>chitta</em> is merged into <em>prakruti</em>, that itself is *moksha *- thinking like this and feeling happy about it is called <em>ambhaa</em>.  By just wearing the sings of <em>sannyaasa</em>, such as <em>kaavi</em> cloth, feeling that one has become a <em>krutaartha</em>, and feeling content and not putting any effort to do <em>upaaya anusthaana</em> is called <em>salilaa</em>.  Thinking that anyway, at whatever time <em>siddhi</em> will happen, so why worry now, and there is no need to put effort, thinking like this and feeling content is <em>aapah</em>,  Thinking that <em>viveka jnyaana</em> cannot be achieved by any other means, but can only happen due to luck, contentment coming out of such thinking is <em>vrushti</em>. The above four are said to be internal forms of contentment.  Five external forms of contentment are - contentment arising from abstinence from five sense objects thinking that they are painful. They perceive defects in the process of earning, saving, spending, enjoying, and not being able to stop enjoyment, etc. and do not put any effort for these, and feel contented. This is <em>tushti</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking that why I should earn money, as it is painful to work, and not doing it and feeling happy about it, is <em>arthasya aarjane viraktih</em>, called as <em>sutaara, supaara, sunetra, maareechaka, uttamaambha</em>.</p>
<p>Now, the <em>taaraka aadi ashta siddhayah</em>. Eight kinds of <em>siddhi</em> are *ooha, *<em>shabda, adhyayana</em>, prevention of three kinds of *dukha *( *aadhyaatmika, *<em>aadhidaivika, aadhibhoutika), suhrut praapti, daana</em>.</p>
<p>Three kinds of <em>siddhi</em> called *dukha vighaata siddhayah *- are the winning over the sorrows caused by three kinds of tapas.</p>
<p>*Abhigamyaakhyaa siddhih, mitra yoga vishaada artha siddhih *- acquiring friends is <em>suhrutpraapti</em>.</p>
<p>[[195]] *Vidvat tapasvi shushrooshaa labhyaartha siddhih sadaa pramutidaakhyaa *<em>siddhih</em>, is called <em>daana</em>.</p>
<p>All these <em>siddhis</em>, nine <em>tushtis</em>, and impairment of senses, are all obstructions to attaining liberation.</p>
<p>The eight kinds of <em>siddhis</em>, the nine kinds of contentment ( <em>tushtis</em>), the impairment of the senses ( <em>indriya ashakti</em>), are explained in the commentary. These are all called <em>anugraha srushti</em>, these are required for the functioning, and they are done for the <em>abhivruddhi</em>. One should get this knowledge, and the obstructions, and then win over that, and then attain <em>moksha</em>. These are all said to be obstructions to <em>moksha</em>; this is told clearly here.</p>

His main purpose was to make sure that <em>yajnya,</em> [[198]] <em>yaaga</em> and the <em>vaidika karmaas</em> told in the <em>Vedaas</em>, are all performed, and the earth will prosper.</p>
<p>This <em>arvaak srotas</em>, which was created in the lower worlds, the <em>manushyaas</em> were created, which was sufficient to achieve His purpose.

They go and reach those <em>devataas</em>, this is told in the <em>Shruti</em>. It was possible to offer the <em>yaagaas</em>, and the <em>manushyaas</em> created were capable of performing these <em>yaagaas</em>, and the gods get pleased with this, and give all the boons; in this way, it was possible to perform <em>yajnyaas</em>.

One day of *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> is said to be a <em>kalpa</em>, and after that, he sleeps for one night. At the beginning of every <em>kalpa</em>, there is <em>kalpa srushti.

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 26:</strong></em> <em><strong>Praakrutaa vaikrutaah cha eva jagatah moola hetavah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Srujato jagadeeshasya kim anyat shrotum icchasi |</strong></em> The primary causes of this world are the <em>praakruta</em> and <em>vaikruta</em> creations. Like this, the Supreme Lord, <em>Paramaatman</em>, created all these things. <em>Parasharar</em> asks *Maitreya *- what else do you want to know?</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: We were studying <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 5, where the various kinds of creation were told briefly. There were eight types of creation told. The initial creations were done by <em>Paramaatman</em> directly. Trees, animals, <em>devaas</em> and <em>manushyaas</em>, then comes <em>anugraha sarga</em>. The first one is <em>mahat</em> and <em>ahamkaara</em>. Then the <em>tanmaatraas</em> is the second. <em>Vaikaarika</em>, that which undergoes <em>vikaara, aindriyaka</em> is the third one. This is the <em>praakruta sarga</em>, during <em>praakruta pralaya</em>, when even *Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> gets merged; when everything gets merged and resides in <em>Paramaatman</em> with <em>ekee bhaava. Sthaavaraas</em> are the fourth one, called <em>mukhya sarga. Tiryak yonis</em>, animals, <em>pashus</em>, are the fifth one. The sixth one is <em>oordhva srotas</em>, gods who live in the upper worlds, who do not touch the earth. Then is the <em>arvaak srotas</em>, the humans who live on earth.</p>
<p><em>Mahat, tanmaatraas, aindriyaka</em>, trees, animals, gods, humans are the seven types. The eighth one is <em>anugraha sarga, saatvika, taamasa</em>. Out of these eight, three are said to be <em>praakruta</em>. Five are said to be *vaikruta. *<em>Praakruta</em> means whatever happens after <em>praakruta pralaya. Vaikruta</em> means after <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> is created, whatever is done through <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> during every <em>kalpa. Anugraha sarga</em> is said to be <em>saatvika</em> and <em>taamasa</em>, impairments to the senses are all *taamasa; **siddhi *(for <em>manushyaas</em>) and *tushti *(for <em>devaas</em>), are said to be <em>saatvika</em>.  [[204]]</p>
<p>The ninth type of creation is said to be <em>koumaara</em>, which is <em>praakruta</em> as well as <em>vaikruta</em>. Two are said there - one is <em>Sanathkumaara</em> and the <em>maanasa putraas</em> of Brahma, and <em>Neelalohita</em>, who is *Rudra. Maanasa *<em>putraas</em> are said to live as long as Brahma&rsquo;s life; they are <em>praakruta</em> as well as <em>vaikruta</em>. Thus, nine creations were told.</p>
<p>After <em>praakruta pralaya</em>, when <em>srushti</em> happens, <em>Sanathkumara</em> and others were created. <em>Rudra srushti</em> was done by <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, at the beginning of every <em>kalpa</em>, this is said to be <em>vaikruta</em>. Therefore, <em>koumaara</em> is said to be <em>praakruta</em> and <em>vaikruta</em>.</p>
<p>The three <em>srushtis</em>, the <em>mahat, tanmaatraas</em> and <em>aindriyaka</em> told, is till the creation of <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, are directly created by <em>Paramaatman</em>, because <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> is not yet created. The term <em>Prajaapati</em> is used to denote Vishnu as well as <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> also. In the *mahat, *<em>tanmaatraas, aindriyaka</em> creations which are <em>praakruta sargaas</em>, the term <em>Prajaapati</em> means <em>Vishnu</em> who is Himself present. Others are all created through <em>Chaturmukha Brahma, Paramaatman</em> being his <em>antaryaami</em>. Here also, <em>Prajaapati</em> in the ultimate sense will denote <em>Paramaatman</em> only, <em>Paramaatman</em> gets the creation done through <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>.</p>

This is all decided based on the <em>poorva janma karmaas</em> of those beings. He is without any partiality. Their qualities, attributes, forms, their nature, are done according to their <em>karmaas</em> only. He has no freedom in creating what he wants; he creates according to their earlier <em>karmaas</em>.</p>
<p>The last few <em>shlokaas</em> of this chapter tell a lot of <em>tattva</em>. We shall these take up in the next class.</p>
<p>We studied the different classifications, subdivisions, different types of beings created. Also the various <em>chandas, saamas</em>, the various Veda <em>bhaagaas, stotraas, yajnyaas</em>. We have to understand that the *Veda *<em>bhaagaas</em> are not created newly every time, but again and again taught by <em>Parabrahman</em>, to <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>. He teaches and gives the powers to some <em>rishis</em> to do <em>saakshatkaara</em>. The <em>Vedaas</em> are <em>apourusheya</em> and <em>nitya</em>. All the beings get associated with various bodies according to their <em>karmaas</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: We were studying <em>Amsha</em> 1, Chapter 5, where we studied the various varieties of beings created by <em>Brahma</em>. He created the various immovables and movables, the <em>naraas, kinnaraas</em>, demons, birds, animals, deer, the variety of beings. Whatever <em>karmaas</em> the sentient beings had accumulated, came the various births. From beginningless time, the sentient beings have been engaged in all kinds of work, and accumulating <em>punya</em> and <em>paapa</em>, the result of various <em>karmaas</em> done. All the time, they are engaged in doing something or the other - *Na hi kaschit kshanam api jaatu tishthati *<em>akarmakrut</em>, he cannot be without doing something even for a fraction of a second. According to these <em>karmaas, Brahma</em>, during creation, gives the  [[221]] various bodies, as <em>nara, kinnara</em>, demons, birds, animals, etc. The Lord, one who creates in the beginning, <em>Bhagavaan</em>, created everything according to each one&rsquo;s previous <em>karmaas</em>. Again and again when they are getting created, they engage in various kinds of work, and accumulate virtues or sins, and they have to experience these; they again get different births; they are getting into this cycle of births and deaths again and again,</p>

According to these qualities, their nature, whatever <em>dharma</em> or <em>adharma</em> are there, good and bad deeds, they are driven by those impressions, they will engage in those acts, and this will be appealing to them; they would like to do only that. One who has the  [[222]] tendency, from previous reminiscent impressions, to speak the truth all the time, they will engage in virtuous acts, and this will only appeal to them; they would want to do more and more of that. They are born, already having inherited these characteristics, this is their nature from the previous <em>karmaas</em>, due to reminiscent impressions, those acts will be appealing to them.</p>

He creates all these things independently. There is one more <em>paathaantara</em> with the same meaning.</p>

<p>This is a very important <em>pramaana</em> used in our <em>aachaaryaa&rsquo;s</em> works. The establish the <em>Veda Nityatva</em>, eternity and impersonality of the <em>Vedaas</em>. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 63:</strong></em> <em><strong>Naama roopam cha bhootaanaam krutyaanaam cha prapanchanam |</strong></em> <em><strong>Veda shabdebhyah eva aadou devaadeenaam chakaara sah ||</strong></em> The names of the various beings, starting with <em>deva</em>, up to the immovables, the four kinds of creations, *deva, manushya, tiryak, sthaavara *- their names like *sura *(gods), *nara *(humans), *mruga *(animals), *khaga *(birds), *vruksha *(trees), the name of their class, is called <em>naama</em>. The form is that they do not blink (for gods), being two legged (humans), being four legged (animals), having branches (trees), is the <em>roopa</em>. The acts that they do are enjoying the <em>havis</em> which is offered during sacrifices (gods), performance of the sacrifices (humans), being the material cause of the sacrifices like the <em>sruk</em>, ladle, spoon, <em>darvi, upadarvi</em>, (from trees, leaves, etc.) - these are all the functions of these classes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Naama iti | Devaadi sthaavara antaanaam bhootaanaam naama sura<br>

* Braahmano agninaa dadheeta * Khaadiram yoopam dhruvam kurveeta<br>
* ityaadi veda shabdebhyah eva jnyaatvaa nirmame |</strong></em> It is told in the <em>Vedaas</em>, that the <em>havis</em> offered to Indra is curd. For <em>yajnya</em>, the <em>braahmana</em> has to bring <em>agni</em> and offer the <em>havis</em>. The <em>stambha</em> for the sacrifice is made from <em>khaadira</em> wood. Knowing all these from  [[224]] the <em>Vedic</em> words, only, he created all these things. Creation was done through understanding of the <em>Vedic</em> words.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, <em>Paramaatman</em>, teaches <em>Vedaas</em> to <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>. This is further taught in the <em>aachaarya - shishya paramparaa</em>, the lineage. He also gives certain sages the powers based on their <em>karmaas</em>, to directly perceive the various parts of the <em>Vedaas</em>, through tapas. The Veda parts are revealed to them directly. The <em>Veda shabda</em> is eternal, present always, and is pronounced in the same order all the time in every <em>kalpa</em>, every <em>srushti</em>. This order is called <em>krama</em>. The same words are used. The *Veda *<em>shabdaas</em> indicate the nature of these objects. The characteristics of everything - like <em>Indra, dadhi</em>, etc. are told in the *Vedaas. Chaturmukha *<em>Brahma</em> will create seeing the <em>Vedic</em> words. One <em>chetana</em> with the right <em>karma</em> will be created as <em>Indra</em>, with this form and name; and that <em>chetana</em> will be called as <em>Indra</em>. Similarly, the object with the material cause, called curd is created, and is given name and form. This word <em>dadhi</em> is already present in the <em>Vedaas. Chaturmukha Brahma</em> knows the word <em>dadhi</em>, and he creates the object and gives it the name. All the <em>devaas</em> are created like this.</p>
<h2 id="64">64</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 64:</strong></em> <em><strong>Rishinaam naamadheyaani yathaa veda shrutaani vai |</strong></em> <em><strong>Tathaa niyoga yogyaani hi anyeshaam api so akarot ||</strong></em> Even the names of the various sages, <em>rishis, Vasishta</em> and others; he creates one sage as <em>Vasishta</em>, another with that kind of <em>karma</em> as <em>Vishvaamitra</em>, even others like <em>Indra, Varuna, Agni, Vaayu</em>, according to their *karmaas, *<em>Harischandra</em>, every individual being, the names are already present; the individual object is created according to that form, based on the words present in the <em>Vedaas</em>, and they are given those names. A new boy is born, and is given the name <em>Devadatta</em>; and <em>Devadatta</em> indicates that person. During creation, the words are present already; the name is not given after creation of the object. The name is already present in the <em>Vedaas</em>, the  [[225]] object is created and named so. Their functioning also, as in Indra is supposed to function like this, these are his capabilities, these are his activities; according to this, whatever he is supposed to do, and the roles like *adhvaryu *(one who performs the sacrifice), *yajamaana *(the owner of the sacrifice, who gets the sacrifice performed through <em>adhvaryu</em>), etc., these are already known in the <em>Vedaas</em>, and are created accordingly. Similarly for <em>samraat</em>. He creates whatever is told in the Vedaas.</p>
<p>Will different souls get different <em>rishi&rsquo;s</em> names in the next creation cycle? This will come in the next <em>shloka</em>. They are said to be <em>pravaaha nitya</em>; someone is always present in this. Different individual selves will be there at different times. It is like the Chief Minister. This name and role is always present, but the individual performing this role differs from time to time. <em>Vasishta</em> and <em>Vishvaamitra</em> are all like this. There is never a period when there is no <em>Vasishta</em>. Only during <em>praakruta pralaya</em>, everyone is merged into <em>Paramaatman</em>; there is no name and form differentiation. This is a cycle which keeps repeating. They are called <em>pravaaha nitya</em>, eternal as a continuous stream. There is one person always in the role as <em>Vasishta</em>. But the individual self who is there as <em>Vasishta</em> will differ. Once that person&rsquo;s karma finishes, he may go to <em>moksha</em>, or may come back to perform various <em>yaagaas</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Kincha rishinaam iti | Rishinaam vasishtaadeenaam, anyeshaam - indra<br>

upapattih |</strong></em> The individual selves are not eternal, they stay in that position according to karma. After that, they go and someone else comes there. The stream of  [[226]] selves occupying that role are eternal. Just like the word <em>vreehi</em>, which stands for grain, is the same in all <em>kalpaas</em>, though the same grain will not be there, this is so. So, it is reasonable to say that they are eternal like a continuous stream of individual selves occupying that role.</p>
<p>In <em>Brahma Sutraas</em>, the <em>Veda Nityatva</em> and <em>Pravaaha Nityatva</em> are answered in three <em>Brahma Sutraas. Samaana naama roopatvaat &hellip; Naama roopa</em> is similar, but the person is not the same. Again and again, different people occupy; their name, form and characteristics are the same, but the individual selves are different.</p>
<h2 id="65">65</h2>
<p>Now, an example is given. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 65:</strong></em> <em><strong>Yathaa ruthushu rutu lingaani naana roopaani paryaye |</strong></em> <em><strong>Drushyante taani taani eva tathaa bhaavaa yugaadishu ||</strong></em> The signs of the various seasons, happen all the time in the same way. The cycle repeats. In the summer season, the same kinds of things happen every year. Same with the winter season. Different forms are there, and keep repeating all the time with the same signs. In the same way, in every <em>yuga</em>, the same thing keeps repeating in the same way.</p>
<p>We may not see the same mango tree the next year. There may be a new mango tree. But we see a mango tree every year. Same with every <em>kalpa</em>. At the end of every <em>kalpa</em>, some worlds get dissolved, not everything. However, during <em>praakruta pralaya</em>, everything gets dissolved, and Supreme Brahman creates as it was earlier. The activities and all are repeating in the same way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em>  [[227]] <em><strong>Pravaaha nityatvam drushtaantena dhrudayati yathaa iti | Rutu<br>
lingaani pushpa phala aadeeni, paryaye punaraavruttou, taani taani<br>
tat tat jaateeyaani eva, yugaadishu yuga kalpa aadi aavruttishu |</strong></em> How the <em>pravaaha nityatva</em> is being established is made firm through an example. Fruits, flowers, when the same season comes next year, a mango fruit, in the next season also will come; in the same way, in every <em>yuga</em> and <em>kalpa</em>, they keep repeating.</p>
<h2 id="66">66</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 5, Shloka 66:</strong></em> <em><strong>Karoti evam vidhaam srushtim kalpaadou sa punah punah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Sisrukshaa shakti yukto asou srujya shakti prachoditah ||</strong></em> In the beginning of the <em>kalpa</em>, again and again the same kind of creation is made by <em>Chaturmukha Brahma. Paramaatman</em> being his <em>antaryaami</em> gets it done. The desire to create, and having the capability to create, being endowed with both, <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> creates according to the karma of those who are going to be created.</p>
