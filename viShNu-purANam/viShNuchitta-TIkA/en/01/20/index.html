<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 20, Shloka 1: <br>
Sri Paraasharah -<br>
Evam sanchintayan vishnum abhedena aatmano dvija |<br>
Tanmayatvam avaapa agryam mene cha aatmaanam achyutam ||</strong></em> *Sri Paraashara *- O <em>Maitreya</em>, this is what happened to <em>Prahlaada</em>. Meditating thus upon <em>Vishnu</em>, thinking of himself as <em>Vishnu</em>, experiencing the <em>Vishnu</em> who is <em>antaryaami</em> in him, he experienced that he merged himself into <em>Vishnu</em>, he reached the perfection of that experience, and because of that he thought of himself as <em>Achyuta</em>.</p>
<p>***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Vishada vishadatara vishadatama kramena yoga kaashtaam praapta iti<br>
aaha evam iti | Aatmano abhedena sva shareerakatvena | Vishnu<br>
shabdah kaarana vaachee, aatma shabdah kaarya bhoota sva<br>
prakaaraka vishnu vaachee, tena api abhedah | Tanmayatvam tat<br>
praachuryam | Agryam utkrushtam, svasya tat aatmakatva<br>
vaishadyaam api | Ata eva aatmaanam achyutam mene | Tanmayatvam<br>
avaapyaage iti cha paathah | ***How <em>Prahlaada</em> reached that pinnacle of <em>Yoga</em>, the ultimate state of <em>Yoga</em>; first it became clear, then it became more clear, and then he had a vivid perception, when he meditated upon <em>Paramaatman. Brahman</em> having him as <em>Brahman&rsquo;s shareera</em>; he himself being the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, that is how he experienced. <em>Vishnu</em> is the cause. When it is said &rsquo; *Sat eva somya *<em>idam agra aaseet, tat aikshata bahusyaam prajaayeya</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;I will be born, I will become many&rsquo;, then He became everything Himself, this is the effect, <em>kaarya bhoota</em>. Everything existed as His mode, being His <em>shareera</em>. This is in the <em>shareera shareeri bhaava</em> with three relationships - *aadhaara *<em>aadheya bhaava, niyaamaka niyaamya bhaava</em> and <em>sheshi shesha bhaava</em>. Everything is present within <em>Paramaatman</em> with these three relationships. The entire world is present as effect, as His mode only, being His <em>shareera</em>. Because <em>Paramaatman</em> is <em>antaryaami</em>, all words denote <em>Paramaatman</em> only in  [[610]] the ultimate analysis, so everything can be called as <em>Vishnu</em> only. *Sarvam *<em>khalvidam brahma</em> means <em>sarvam brahmaatmakam</em>, everything can be called as <em>Brahman</em> in the <em>aparyavasaana vrutti</em>. Any name and form is <em>Paramaatman</em> only. <em>Shruti</em> says clearly - *Prajaapatih prajaa asrujata, taa *<em>srushtaah samashlishyan, saa roopena anupraavishat</em>, &hellip;, when <em>Paramaatman</em> created everything, everything was existing as Him only, united in Him; He did <em>anupravesha</em> as form; so they say that all forms as <em>Paramaatman</em> only, and He did <em>anupravesha</em> in names also; so all names as <em>Brahman</em> only. All forms and names are <em>Brahman</em>. This means that everything has <em>Paramaatman</em> as <em>antaryaami. Prahlaada</em> meditated as <em>kaarana roopa Vishnu</em> became <em>kaarya</em>, he experienced the <em>Brahmaatmakatva</em> directly; he had abundance of that experience. Then he thought himself as <em>Achyuta</em>, he had vivid perception of <em>Paramaatman</em> being <em>antaryaami</em>, and he being the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. In this state, he thought of himself as <em>Achyuta</em>. ***</p>

Visasmaara tadaa aatmaanam na anyat kinchit ajaanata |<br>
Aham eva avyayo anantah paramaatmaa iti achintayat ||*** He forgot himself, he did not know anything else, he thought of himself as only the immutable one, I am only <em>Ananta</em>, I am only <em>Paramaatman</em>. He had this experience. ***<br>
Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Visasmaraa iti | Ayoga dashaayaam aatmaanam atadaatmaktvena<br>
bhraantyaa vaasitam visasmaara | Sva prakaashasya yoga dashaayaam<br>
aavirbhootasya cha svaroopasya vismarana ayogaat; svaroopa<br>
vismrutou tu vaamadevaadeh * Aham manuh abhavam ityaadi<br>
vachanavat mattah sarvam ityaadi vachanam na syaat | Tarhi katham<br>
achintayat tatra aaha aham eva avyayah iti |*** Now he is in <em>yoga dasha</em>. Earlier he was in <em>ayoga dasha</em>. We are all in *ayoga *<em>dasha</em>; in this <em>dasha</em>, we don&rsquo;t experience <em>Brahman</em> as <em>aatman</em>, the experience that we are all <em>brahmaatmaka</em> is not there in the <em>ayoga dasha</em>. In the <em>yoga dasha</em>, it will be experienced completely. In the <em>ayoga dasha</em>, what he thought himself as not <em>brahmaatmaka</em>, which is due to wrong knowledge, *bhraanti *- he forgot that. What he was thinking in the *ayoga *<em>dasha</em>, that he was not <em>brahmaatmaka</em>, he forgot that wrong knowledge. The knowledge of <em>Aham Brahma Asmi</em> is not <em>svaroopa aikya</em>, that <em>Brahman</em> only is true and nothing else exists - this is not that kind of knowledge; the knowledge is that I am also true, but am having <em>Brahman</em> as  [[611]] the inner self, and I am the <em>shareera</em> of *Paramaatman *- this kind of experience. <em>Visasmaara</em> means that he forgot the earlier knowledge that he had, that was not not in the <em>yoga dasha</em>, the wrong knowledge that he was not <em>brahmaatmaka</em>. This is because he had reached the vivid perception of <em>Paramaatman</em> as <em>aatman</em>. In <em>yoga dasha</em>, one experiences the self, as the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, that <em>Paramaatman</em> is present as the inner self. In the first stage, he experiences the individual self, and then experiences the individual self as having <em>Paramaatman</em> as <em>aatman</em>. At that stage, the individual self is <em>svayam prakaasha</em>. We are not able to experience this because of our karma, and because our *dharma bhoota *<em>jnyaana</em> is hindered, covered and contracted. In the <em>yoga dasha</em>, one will be able to experience the individual self&rsquo;s <em>svaroopa</em>, which is *svayam *<em>prakaasha</em>. This <em>svayam prakaasha</em> cannot disappear at that stage. In *yoga *<em>dasha</em>, that <em>svayam prakaasha</em> will become <em>aavirbhoota</em>, it reveals itself directly; this cannot be forgotten. <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> quotes *Rishi *<em>Vaamadeva</em> from <em>Upanishads</em>, that &lsquo;I am only <em>Manu</em>, I only became <em>Manu</em>, I am only <em>Soorya</em>&rsquo; - he experiences like this. I and <em>Paramaatman</em> are different and distinct, but the relationship is <em>aatma shareera bhaava</em>. It is not the experience of I merging into <em>Paramaatman</em>, and losing the <em>svaroopa</em>; because the <em>svaroopa</em> which is <em>svayam prakaasha</em> of the individual self, that reveals more vividly at that time. Then the <em>Paramaatma svaroopa</em> is also experienced, with the relation. If he had forgotten his <em>svaroopa</em> itself, if he had not realized his own self itself at that time, he could not have said &rsquo; <em>Mattah sarvam&rsquo;, &lsquo;Aham sarvam&rsquo;. Prahlaada&rsquo;s svaroopa</em>, which is *svayam *<em>prakaasha</em>, is well revealed at that stage. He realized that it was <em>brahmaatmaka</em>, the <em>shareera</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. Then he realized that &lsquo;I am only immutable, and <em>Ananta</em>&rsquo;. ***</p>

Then he remembered himself as <em>Prahlaada</em>, which he had completely forgotten as he had the experience of the self, <em>Vishnu</em> as <em>aatman</em>, and he had vivid perception of <em>Vishnu</em>. When he came out, at that moment, due to power of <em>yoga</em>, he threw away everything, and came outside from the waters.  [[613]]</p>

Everything which is a modification of <em>prakruti</em>, called <em>praakruta</em>, it all has these three *gunaas - *<em>mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas, ekaadasha indriyaas</em>.

In causal state, this whole world is present in subtle state, and is existing united with *Paramaatman. *<em>Paramaatman</em> is only present in the subtle state, qualified, <em>sookshma chit</em> [[615]] <em>achit vishishta Paramaatman</em>, the *kaarana. Sthoola chit achit vishishta *<em>Paramaatman</em> is the <em>kaarya</em>. In the <em>Vishvaroopa Adhyaaya</em> of *Bhagavad *<em>Geetha</em>, this is told wonderfully, where <em>Arjuna</em> sees the <em>Vishvaroopa</em> of *Paramaatman *- this form of <em>Paramaatman</em> is said to be <em>Mahaa Moorti</em>. Or also the form of <em>Vaishvaanara</em>, which is told in <em>Upanishads, dyouh moordhaa, soorya</em> and <em>chandra</em> are His eyes; the whole world is imagined as a form of <em>Paramaatman</em> itself; this is how they meditate upon in <em>Vaishvaanara vidyaa</em>. He is *Vaishvaanara moorti. Sookshma *<em>moorti</em> is <em>vyooha roopa, Vyooha Vaasudeva</em>, which is very subtle; *sphuta *<em>roopa</em> is <em>vibhava</em>, where He comes as <em>Raama, Krishna</em>, where He moves around and talks to people. <em>Asphuta</em> is the <em>para roopa</em>.

bhaava bhaavana |</strong></em> Ferocious form is when <em>Paramaatman</em> is doing <em>samhaara, pralaya</em>. By Himself, He is of very pleasant form. <em>Avidyaa</em> is <em>karma</em>, or also the wrong knowledge. <em>Vidyaa</em> is all the <em>upaasanaas. Asat</em> means <em>abhaava roopa</em>, not that He does not have any form, He has got a very subtle form, and is present as <em>naastitva vishishta Paramaatman</em>, which is not perceptible to our <em>indriyaas. Sat</em> itself is <em>Paramaatman</em>. In <em>Bhagavad Geetha</em>, it is told that upon doing <em>karma</em>, if we do <em>Om Tat</em>, or <em>Om Sat</em>, or when we are doing some good <em>karmaas, Sat</em> is told. When He creates <em>sat bhaava</em> and <em>asat bhaava</em> for all the <em>vastus, asat bhaava</em> can be taken as impermanent, <em>sat bhaava</em> is that which is <em>nitya</em>. He does <em>sankalpa</em> that some objects may be eternal, like <em>aatman</em>. Why is <em>prakruti</em> changing form all the time, in <em>avyakta</em> form, it is also <em>nitya</em>; but in the manifested form, <em>prakruti, aakaasha, vaayu</em>, etc. are all <em>anitya</em>; they merge during <em>pralaya</em>. Why are they like that - it is <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s sankalpa</em> that they should be like that. If He does <em>sankalpa</em> that something should be <em>anitya</em>, it becomes <em>anitya</em>. If He  [[616]] does <em>sankalpa</em> that something should be <em>nitya</em>, it becomes <em>nitya</em>. He is the cause of all these. He knows also, and makes them to be like that. For both reasons, He can be called as <em>sat asat bhaava bhaavanaa</em>. ***</p>

That which is revealed, and well seen, manifest; and because He is <em>sookshma</em>, He is not seen. He is only present as everything means that He has got everything other than Himself as His body, <em>shareera</em>. Everything is existing as <em>shareera</em> to Him. Though He is having everything as His <em>shareera</em>, He is different and distinct from everything else - His <em>svaroopa</em> and <em>svabhaava</em> is very different. Because He is all pervading, everything is existing in Him, He supports everything, He is the Master, Supreme God, having everything as His <em>shareera</em>. He is not <em>jeevaatman</em>, He is not <em>prakruti</em>, He is not any <em>praakruta</em> form, because He is very different and distinct from all these. He is only everything as He is present as <em>antaryaami</em> of everything. He is *brahmaatmaka. Avishva *<em>hetu</em> means that He is not the cause of the world - He only creates, it is told; but the various forms that are created, one person becomes human, one becomes <em>deva</em>, one becomes <em>pashu, pakshi, sareesrupa</em>, all these are driven by the <em>karma</em> of those individual beings; He is not the cause of each individual getting different forms and lives, but their own <em>karma</em> is the cause of all that; in this sense, He is not the cause of this variety, *vishama *<em>srushti</em> which we see here. Though He is the creator, He is just doing the act of creation, but the various bodies that the individual selves take is due to their own karma.</p>
