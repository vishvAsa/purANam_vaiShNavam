Prachetasah oochuh -   
Nataassma sarva vachasaam pratishthaa yatra shaashvatee |   
Tam aadyantam asheshasya jagatah paramam prabhum ||*** *Prachetasaas* prayed thus to *Bhagavaan *- They pray Him as the cause of everything whatever is created, being the *antaryaami*. We prostrate unto the One, where the ultimate meaning of all words rests, He who creates the entire world, and is also the final resort of the entire world, where everything merges unto Him during *pralaya*, we prostrate unto Him. 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Nataassma iti | Vachasaam yatra pratishthaa | Vaachye hi vachasaam   
pratishthaa | Pravrutti nimitta maatram hi sarvam vastu jaatam   
vachasaam, na tu pradhaanatayaa vaachyam, yathaa guna jaati   
aadikam | ****Vaachya* is the object denoted by the word, *vaak*. The word rests in the  [[486]] object which it denotes. All the words ultimately denote *Bhagavaan*, as He did *anupravesha*, and *naama roopa vyaakarana* was done by *Bhagavaan* only, so all words in the ultimate sense denote *Bhagavaan* only. If we say so, how can we used the words to denote objects, in our normal transactions? It is only for a particular purpose that we use, and the connotation of the word is limited because of our need and the way we understand. So, when we say that this is a mobile, the meaning of the word rests in that object only; in the ultimate sense it is resting in *Bhagavaan* who is *antaryaami* of everything. The primary meaning of the word goes up to the *antaryaami **Bhagavaan*, who is the inner self of all objects. When we say *gouh, **manushyah, devah*, we limit the connotations to the objects which we see and perceive, but in the ultimate sense, they all rest in *Bhagavaan* only. It is only for our transactional purposes that we limit the meanings. 



When we say that ' *Devadaatta* is a *manushya*', the purpose of that word is to make one understand the class of the person. Whereas it is not the primary meaning. The primary meaning of all words is *Bhagavaan* only. All words ultimately connote *Bhagavaan* only. ***

Yonibhootam asheshasya sthaavarsya charasya cha ||*** He is the cause of all movables and immovables. His wonderful lustrous form is not material, it is *apraakruta*. He is One who is present before anything else; He is the cause of everything. All luminous objects get their luminosity, shine, brightness only from *Bhagavaan*; they are not independent, they are dependent on *Bhagavaan*. There is no comparison for Him; He is incomparable. He is very *sookshma*, subtle. He is not limited by time, place of object; He is present at all times, in all places, in all objects. ***

He is present as *antaryaami* of *kaala*, He controls *kaala*, and is *kaalaatmaka*. Though He does not have a form, He can take any form, He can be without form, day itself is His first form.

He is the cause of the whole world, He is the one who creates all beings, embodied souls.

How does the eye perceive the object? It is explained in the *shaastraas* that the rays go to the object from the eye, and come into contact with the object, which is at a distance, and then they get back to the eye, and convey the message. This is how the *indriya*, the eye, travels to the object which it perceives, comes into contact, and this is how it is able to perceive the object. So, it is not staying in one place and perceiving. That is why they are called *ksharam. Akshara* is the organ of hearing, is staying in one place, and sound reaches the ear for it to be perceived. ***

To that *Bhagavaan* who is present in the form of the individual selves, we prostrate unto Him. ***

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 14, Shloka 38:    
Avikaaram ajam shuddham nirgunam yat niranjanam |   
Nataassma tat param brahma vishnoh yat paramam padam ||*** The *mukta svaroopa* is told here. Though the *jeevaatman*, in the *baddha* state, his *svaroopa* is *avikaari*, because his *dharma bhoota **jnyaana* undergoes contraction and expansion, he has *vikaara*; whereas *muktaatma* does not have that. One who is *avikaari*, one who is  [[492]] unborn, pure, without any *praakruta* or *heya gunaas*, one who is totally detached from the association with *prakruti*, called as *parambrahma* with respect to *prakruti*; for a *mukta aatma*, the *dharma bhoota **jnyaana* becomes unlimited, expands completely and becomes equal to that of *Paramaatman*, he also gets *bruhatva* or *brahmatva*, huge; he becomes sovereign, not ruled over by *karma* anymore; that *Bhagavaan* who is present in the form of *muktaas*, I prostrate unto Him.

Adeergha hrasvam asthoolam ananu ashyaaman alohitam |   
Asneham achaayam atanum asaktam ashareerinam || ***These are all attributes of *Bhagavaan* directly now. He is neither long nor short, He is neither subtle nor gross, neither black nor red, He may or may not have *shareera*, He is not interested, ... 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Ahamkaaraadi mukta paryanta roopavatah parasya svaroopam aaha   
adeergha iti | Anena vyakta avyakta baddha muktebyo vyaavruttih |   
Chaaya kaantih | Atanum niravayavam | Asaktam apratihatam | ***Starting with *ahamkaara* upto the *muktaas*, all forms and *prakruti* are told as *Bhagavaan. Bhagavaan's svaroopa* is told here. *Baddhaas, muktaas, **vyakta, avyakta prakruti* are told here. Two forms of creation are there -*samashti* and *vyashti; prakruti* is in *avyakta* form during *samashti srushti*, becomes *vyakta* during *vyashti srushti. Bhagavaan's svaroopa* is told as neither this nor that. He is different and distinct from everything other than Himself. He is different and distinct from manifest, unmanifest, from the bound selves, from the liberated selves, everything. *Chaaya* is His lustre. 



*Shruti* also says - *Asthoolam ananu ahrasvam adeergam akaayam acchaayam* [[493]] *... *

*Sarva gandhah* is also told in *Shruti*. He also listens to the prayers of the devotees and sees everything. *Chakshushmate shrunvate te braveemi*. ***

Arajo shabda amrutam aplutam yadasamvrutam |   
Poorva apare na vai yasmin tat vishnoh paramam padam ||*** He does not have *gati* like us, He is present everywhere, and cannot be said to go from here to there, He does not have the *praakrutika gunaas*, there is nothing which can exist before Him, or after Him, as He has no beginning nor end, *Bhagavaan's* form is directly eulogized with all these attributes. 



He cannot be told as only a particular attribute. He can be anything and  [[494]] everything. ***

Parameshatva gunavat sarva bhootam asamshrayam |   
Nataassma tat padam vishnoh jihvaat druk gocharam na yat ||*** He has the attribute of overlord of everything, ruling over everything. He is the inner self of everything. He is not dependent on anyone, and is not controlled by anyone. He has no controller for Himself. *Nityaas* and others, they function as per *Bhagavaan's sankalpa* only. *Asamshrayam* is an attribute which differentiates Him from the *nityaas*. He cannot be perceived by either our mind or sight, nor cannot be eulogized enough through words. One cannot imagine what is His nature. One cannot eulogize Him any amount. We bow down to the *Bhagavaan* of this wonderful nature. 



*Yato vaacho nivartante apraapya manasaa saha | * 



***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:   
Param iti | Parameshitva gunavat iti cha paathah | Parameshitva   
gunavat iti mukta vyaavruttih | Asamshrayam iti nitya vyaavruttih |   
Sarva bhootam sarvaatma bhootam | ***



This is how *Prachetasaas* eulogized *Bhagavaan* as being present as everything, whatever we see here in this world, in the *vyakta, **avyakta* forms, the *aatmaas, nityaas, muktaas, baddhaas*, being different and distinct from everything else. ***

Sri Paraasharah -   
Evam prachetaso vishnum stuvantah tat samaadhayah |   
Dasha varsha sahasraani tapah cheruh mahaarnave ||*** With such concentration on *Bhagavaan* that they were completely merged in  [[495]] His thought, eulogizing Him, the *Prachetasaas*, being immersed in the waters of the ocean, they performed penance for ten thousand years. ***   


## 45
Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 14, Shloka 45:    
Tatah prasanno bhagavaan teshaam antarjale harih |   
Dadou darshanam unnidra neelotpala dalacchavih ||*** *Bhagavaan* being very pleased with their worship, He directly appeared in front of them, in the waters itself, He revealed His wonderful form, with the lustre of the just bloomed petals of the lotus.

Sa cha api devah tam dattvaa yathaa abhilashitam varam |   
Antardhaanam jagaamaashu te cha nischakramuh jalaat || ****Bhagavaan* immediately gave them that boon. He disappeared having given them the boon, and said 'So be it, and it will happen'. Then they came out of the water. 



 [[496]] With this, the Fourteenth Chapter comes to a completion. Where the *Prachetasaas* eulogized *Bhagavaan* most wonderfully, and get their desired boon from *Bhagavaan* who appeared in front of them on the *Garuda*.

All this time, for ten thousand years, the *Prachetasaas* were performing penance under water.
