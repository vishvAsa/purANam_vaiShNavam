<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying about how <em>Dhruva</em>, after obtaining the <em>upadesha</em> of the <em>mantra</em>, and the process of performing meditation on <em>Paramaatman</em>, or <em>upaasane</em>, goes in search of a sacred place, and finds the place where <em>Shatrughna</em> had built the <em>Mathura puri</em>; in that sacred place, he starts to meditate as taught by the <em>Saptarshis</em>.</p>

At that time, <em>Hari</em>, who was the object of meditation, who  [[389]] is present in all beings, for his mind and thinking, there was nothing else which was the object of his thinking. Vishnu became completely the object of his thoughts.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 8:</strong></em> <em><strong>Manasi avasthite tasmin vishnou maitreya yoginah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Na shashaaka dharaa bhaaram udvodhum bhoota dhaarinee ||</strong></em> When <em>Vishnu</em> filled the mind of the yogi completely like that, the earth which supports all beings, could not tolerate the weight of <em>Dhruva</em> because <em>Vishnu</em> was completely filled in him.</p>
<p><em>Paraasharar</em> calls <em>Dhruva</em> as a <em>yogi</em> here. <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> had commented earlier that <em>ashtaanga yoga</em> was taught as an accessory of his meditation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Manasi iti | Na shashaaketi | Garimaakhya siddhih aaseet iti arthah |</strong></em> There are <em>ashta siddhis</em>, eight types of <em>siddhis</em>, which are told for *Yogis, **animaa, mahimaa, garimaa, laghimaa, praapti, praakaamya, eeshatva, *<em>vashitva. Garimaa</em> is told, which means that he became very heavy. Earth was not able to tolerate him due to the meditation on <em>Vishnu</em>.</p>
<p>[[390]] <em>Animaa mahimaa chaiva garimaa laghimaa tathaa |</em> <em>Praaptih praakaamyam eeshatvam vashitvam cha ashta siddhayah ||</em> <em>Yogis</em> can become very subtle and enter into something, they can become very heavy also.</p>

When he was standing on his left leg, that half of the hemisphere of the earth just bent and swung down, not able to tolerate the weight. When he stood on the right leg, the other half of the earth went down, not able to bear the weight.</p>

Then, the entire earth, with all the mountains, shook up because of not able to tolerate his weight. That is the power of his <em>tapas</em>, meditation.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 11:</strong></em> <em><strong>Nadyo nadaa samudraah cha samkshobham paramam yayuh |</strong></em> <em><strong>Tat kshobhaat amaaraah kshobham param jagmuh mahaamune ||</strong></em>  [[391]] All the oceans, rivers and streams, were completely disturbed. Because of that, the earth got shaken up and disturbed, the gods could not tolerate that, and were highly disturbed and thrown out of balance.</p>
<h2 id="12">12</h2>
<p>This is normally what the <em>devaas</em> do. When one does great penance and please the deity whom they are meditating upon, the deity is obliged to give them the boon; they get the position they ask. If one is meditating to attain the <em>Indra padavi</em>, when the meditation matures, that deity has to appear and grant him the boon that he desires. Like this, all the gods have attained their places. Whenever someone starts to meditate, they are all highly disturbed and feel that someone will come and occupy their position and they will lose their position and power. <em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 12:</strong></em> <em><strong>Yaamaa naama tadaa devaa maitreya paramaakulaah |</strong></em> <em><strong>Indrena saha sammantrya dhyaana bhangam prachakramuh ||</strong></em> The <em>Yaama</em> gods got worried and disturbed, they discussed with <em>Indra</em>, and they wanted to disturb or break the meditation, concentration of <em>Dhruva</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Yaamaa iti | Yaamaah svaayambhuva manvantare devaah |</strong></em> In the <em>Svaayambhuva manvantara</em>, there were a class of <em>devaas</em> called <em>Yaamaas</em>.</p>

They started to try all kinds of things to break his meditation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Kooshmaandaah iti | Kooshmaandaah upadeva bhedaah |</strong></em> <em>Kooshmaandaas</em> are another sub class of gods.</p>
<h2 id="14">14</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 14:</strong></em> <em><strong>Suneetirnaama tat maataa saasraa tat puratah sthitaa |</strong></em> <em><strong>Putreti karunaam vaacham aaha maayaa mayee tadaa ||</strong></em> At that time, his mother by name <em>Suneeti</em>, with tears in her eyes, stood in front of him. She called <em>Dhruva</em> as &ldquo;O my son&rdquo;, with a heart breaking tone. She was a <em>Maayaa Suneeti</em>, not the real <em>Suneeti. Kooshmaandaas</em> took on a form like <em>Suneeti</em>, came crying in front of <em>Dhruva</em> and called him with great sorrow.</p>
<h2 id="15">15</h2>
<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 12, Shloka 15:</strong></em> <em><strong>Putraka asmaat nivartasva shareeraatyaya daarunaat |</strong></em> <em><strong>Nirbandhito mayaa labdho bahubhih tvam manorathaih ||</strong></em> You are torturing your body with this fierce tapas, fierce meditation, which is very harsh.

I have so much sorrow. You should not be deserting me. I do not have anybody to help me look after me. You should not desert me. Listening to the other wife of the king, you have deserted me.

When he is eligible for <em>upanayana, sandhyaavandanaa</em> is told. Like this, according to age, different duties are prescribed. There is a <em>Puraana vachana</em>, that when one&rsquo;s mother is suffering, if he goes to <em>punya teertha</em>, it is a waste; if one does <em>daana</em> also, it is a waste; if one does <em>japa</em> also, it is wasted; if one does <em>homa</em>, it is also wasted; such a person engaged in all these activities, thinking that they are all <em>dharma</em>, when his mother is suffering, he is wasting his time, his entire life doing <em>adharma</em> only. What is against my good, my wish, and also it is not suiting your age; because of these, you are doing <em>adharma</em>, turn away from that. This is what <em>Maayaa Suneeti</em> is telling. There is another *paatha *- whatever are the duties according to your age, you follow that in order to please me. What one wants to do, that is not superior to doing the service of father, mother, guru. If they permit, then only it is a superior dharma which will do all kinds of good. If parents permit them to do some dharma, even if it is ridiculed by all others, it is dharma only; this is told in <em>Mahaabhaarata</em>. Like this, she is telling him to turn away from this <em>daaruna tapas</em>, this fierce penance.</p>

<p>This is well known as <em>Dhruva Stuti</em>. He starts to eulogize <em>Bhagavaan</em> in a most wonderful way. There are explanations and commentary for this <em>Dhruva Stuti</em>. We will take this up in the next class. <em>Dhruva</em> gets the knowledge to eulogize <em>Bhagavaan</em> because he was touched by the <em>Shankha</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>.</p>
<p>We studied today how <em>Dhruva</em> did <em>ghora tapas</em>, and nobody could disturb him. And how <em>Vishnu</em> revealed Himself to that small boy, and grants him whatever he desires. First he desires to eulogize <em>Bhagavaan</em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we had just started to study the *Dhruva *<em>Stuti. Dhruva</em>, a small 5 year old boy, wonderfully meditated upon *Sri *<em>Vishnu</em>, with the <em>Dwaadashaakshara Mantra</em> taught by <em>Saptarshis</em>. So intense was his <em>dhyaana</em>, and he was meditating with so much devotion, that finally <em>Vishnu</em> appears right in front of him. When <em>Dhruva</em> sees the grand form of <em>Vishnu</em> in front of him, he does not know how to pray and what to do, he surrenders unto <em>Bhagavaan</em> seeking His grace. <em>Bhagavaan</em> touches him with the divine conch, and immediately <em>Dhruva</em> gets the <em>divya jnyaana</em>, and starts to eulogize <em>Bhagavaan. Paraasharar</em> continues to tell <em>Maitreya</em> how <em>Dhruva</em> prays to <em>Bhagavaan</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dhruva</em> praises <em>Bhagavaan</em> and says that everything is <em>Bhagavaan</em> only. He tells <em>Mahaavishnu</em> that &lsquo;You are only everything right from <em>achetana</em> [[407]] <em>prakruti</em> to all the modifications and states in which <em>prakruti</em> exists&rsquo;. The <em>baddha</em>, the <em>muktaas</em>, everything that exists is <em>Bhagavaan</em> only.</p>

This also includes the <em>tanmaatraas, manas, buddhi. Manas</em> includes the other sense organs also the <em>jnyaanendriyaas</em> and <em>karmendriyaas</em>. This is <em>upalakshana. Buddhi</em> is <em>mahaan, mahat tattva. Bhootaadi</em> is <em>ahamkaara</em>, from which <em>pancha bhootaas</em> are created. <em>Aadi prakruti</em> is *pradhaana, *<em>avyakta</em>. All these are Whose form, that <em>Bhagavaan</em>, I bow down to.</p>
<p><em>Pancha bhootaas, tanmaatraas, ahamkaara, mahat tattva, pradhaana</em>, everything is Your <em>shareera</em> only. You are <em>antaryaami</em> existing in everything. In this way, all the words denote <em>Paramaatman</em> only, *Vedaih cha sarvaih *<em>aham eva vedyah</em>. Before *naama roopa vyaakarana, *<em>Bhagavaan</em> does <em>anupravesha</em>, and does <em>naama roopa vyaakarana</em>. All names and forms in the ultimate sense denote <em>Paramaatman</em> only. This is what <em>Dhruva</em> is eulogizing <em>Bhagavaan</em> that &lsquo;You are only <em>pradhaana</em>, You are only <em>mahat tattva</em>, You are only <em>ahamkaara</em>, all these are Your forms only. That <em>Bhagavaan</em> who is existing in all these forms, I bow down to You&rsquo;.</p>

He is associated with <em>prakruti</em> and experiences the <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em>, the effects. This is telling about the <em>baddha purusha</em>.

By itself, it is huge. It can make something also attain that mighty form. <em>Dhruva</em> is eulogizing <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s divya roopa</em> itself, directly. He is <em>bruhat</em>. He can also make something else attain that form. <em>Jeevaatmans</em> attain <em>aanantya</em> in their <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> when they attain <em>moksha</em>. Their <em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> is <em>sankuchita</em> in the bound state. When they attain liberation, <em>Paramaatman</em> makes *jeevaatman&rsquo;s *<em>dharma bhoota jnyaana</em> become <em>ananta</em>, just as equal to <em>Paramaatman</em>. <em>Paramaatman</em> makes <em>jeevaatman</em> also become <em>bruhat</em> in terms of attributive nature. He is <em>eka roopa</em>, unchanged, immutable. The second <em>roopa</em> is <em>divya mangala vigraha</em>. His <em>divya mangala vigraha</em> is also like that.

purushasya mahatvam pratipaaditam |</strong></em> <em>Sahasra</em> does not mean thousand, it represents unending, innumerable. Innumerable heads, innumerable eyes, innumerable feet. It is not just the limbs and head; it denotes the <em>jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>. Because of this, His <em>vyaapti,</em> pervasion is also everywhere, unending. By telling the head, all the parts of the body are indicated. The head is the abode, controlling place of all the <em>jnyaanendriyaas</em> and <em>karmendriyaas</em>. *Shiras *<em>shabda</em> indicates <em>jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em>, which are <em>ananta</em>. The head controlling the sense organs, the effects are denoted here. The declension of this *shiras *<em>shabda</em> is told as knowing, meditating or thinking, listening, touching, sight, taste, smelling - all these are controlled there; all these are digested there and everything is processed in the head; this is why <em>shiras</em> is said to be the <em>nirvachana</em> of that. By all these explanations, we can understand that the <em>Purusha</em> having thousand heads means <em>Purusha</em> who is having innumerable, unending, <em>ananta jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em>. There is no limit to His powers and knowledge. This is being told clearly in these words. *Sahasra *<em>aksha</em> means <em>aanantya</em> of <em>jnyaana</em>, <em>sahasra paat</em> means <em>aanantya</em> of <em>shakti</em>; because <em>akshi</em> indicates <em>jnyaanendriya</em> and foot indicates <em>karmendriya</em>. <em>Akshi shabda</em> indicates all the <em>jnyaanendriyaas</em>, and the <em>paada shabda</em> indicates all the <em>karmendriyaas</em>. Here, <em>Bhagavaan</em> is not told as having all the limbs, we have to understand it as the effects of all that, the functions performed by the <em>jnyaanendriyaas</em> and <em>karmendriyaas</em>; the <em>aanantya</em> of <em>jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em> is to be understood here. What is  [[413]] the <em>pramaana</em> for this? <em>Shvetaashvatara Upanishad</em> says that &lsquo;He does not have <em>deha</em> and <em>indriyaas</em> like we have. We get all of these because of the <em>karmaas</em> to experience the results of the <em>karmaas</em>. He is <em>karmaadhyaksha</em>, and so does not have body and <em>indriyaas</em> like ours. For Him, there is no one who is equal or above Him. All His *jnyaana kriya, bala *<em>kriya</em> are natural to Him. He is endowed with innumerable varieties of powers&rsquo;. Nobody can imagine His powers, and nobody can say that He is like this, He is not like this, He can be anything in any form in any way. *Yo vetti *<em>yugapat sarvam pratyakshena sadaa svatah</em>, is what *Swami *<em>Yaamunaachaarya</em> says in his <em>Nyaaya Tattva mangala shloka</em>. He is one who knows at the same time, everything, He perceives directly, all the time, by Himself. This is the <em>sarvajnyatva</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>. He can perceive everything directly all the time, either with using the <em>indriyaas</em>, or without using the <em>indriyaas</em>, with body or without body, with limbs or without limbs, He has such wonderful unimaginable powers and capabilities. The *Paramaatma *<em>svaroopa</em> nobody can fully understand or perceive that. <em>Shruti</em> is clearly declaring all these qualities of <em>Paramaatman</em>, &lsquo;He does not have hands and legs like us, He can move around anywhere, and He can hold anything&rsquo;. <em>Srivatsaanka Mishra</em> tells &lsquo;When we read about *Sahasra sheershah *<em>purushah, sahasra aaksha, sahasra paat</em>, when we imagine with our human heads and eyes, and feet, it will look like a very ugly form; it is not like this; <em>shalali</em> is porcupine and <em>shalala</em> is the quill of the porcupine, porcupine&rsquo;s body is filled with quills, and it looks very ugly with the quills all over, <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> form is not ugly like that; <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> form is not filled with heads and eyes and feet all over His body just like the quill of a porcupine, then how else is this to be imagined? It is like one who has eyes which can see to any end, unending, unlimited sight, limbs which can reach to any place, end of anything, He can see everything and do everything&rsquo;. <em>Taittiriya Aaranyaka</em> says that &lsquo;I was here before itself&rsquo;, <em>Purusha</em> who is described in the <em>Purusha Sookta</em> is the Creator of everything, He was present before anything else was present, that is the <em>Purushatva</em> of Him, one who exists before anything else. He fills everything, there is nothing which is not <em>bhagavat aatmaka</em>. He is residing everywhere, that is why He is said to be <em>Purusha</em>. The <em>nirvachana</em> of *Purusha *<em>shabda</em> is given in many ways - <em>puri shete</em>, one who resides in the body, He resides in all beings, all bodies, He is <em>Purusha</em>; He fills everything, He is said  [[414]] to be <em>Purusha</em>; He was present before anything else, He is <em>Purusha</em>. What exists, what becomes is <em>bhooh</em>. It is not <em>mithya</em> or <em>asat</em>, it is <em>sat</em>; it exists in all beings, sentient or non sentient, everything is indicated by *bhuvah. *<em>Dashaangulam</em> is not just ten inches, but it is of huge proportion. He stands above all these things, exceeding everything, as He pervades everything. Having touched the entire world consisting of the sentient and non sentient, He stands above and beyond everything. <em>Mahaa Naaraayanopanishad</em> says &lsquo;By whom is pervaded the <em>antariksha loka, dyu loka, pruthivi loka</em>, everything, He is the One. Whatever is seen or heard in this world, <em>Naaraayana</em> exists pervading it from inside or outside&rsquo;. <em>Jagat</em> is <em>vyaapya</em>, that which is pervaded; <em>Vyaapaka</em>, one who pervades, is the <em>Purusha</em>. This is told very clearly in all these <em>Shruti pramaanaas</em>. His greatness is told because He pervades everything.</p>

In <em>Vaayu Puraana, viraat, svaraat</em> and <em>samraat</em> are told as various <em>lokaas</em>, worlds. This <em>loka</em> is said to be *samraat. Antariksha *<em>loka</em> is said to be <em>viraat. Svaraat</em> is another <em>loka</em>. Everything exists for <em>Paramaatman</em>, He is the <em>shareeri.

The *aatma samashti *<em>roopa</em>, the collectivity of all individual selves, is said to be *Hiranya *<em>Garbha</em> also. From You only, all these are created, supported, everything is You only. <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s</em> wonderful <em>svaroopa</em> is told here.</p>

When <em>Shvetaketu</em> breaks it, he sees a small part of it; <em>Uddhalaka</em> asks to break it further, and <em>Shvetaketu</em> says that he does not see anything. From this seed which you don&rsquo;t see, a huge <em>nyagrodha</em> tree is created.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:</strong></em> <em><strong>Nyagrodha iti | Samyame samhaare |</strong></em></p>
<p>Further, <em>Dhruva</em> continues to eulogize <em>Bhagavaan</em>, in a most wonderful way, how creation happens, etc. <em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying <em>Dhruva Stuti</em>, where he is eulogizing <em>Paramaatman</em>, very similar to <em>Purusha Sookta</em>, the way <em>Shruti</em> eulogizes <em>Bhagavaan</em>, extolling the way in which He created everything. In the same way, <em>Dhruva</em> also did <em>stuti</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>.</p>

<p>This is a very important <em>siddhaanta</em> we have to understand, and this is also established in the <em>Brahma Sutraas</em>.</p>

The innumerable types of these objects here, You who are the cause are no different from the effect which is this whole world. This is clearly established in the <em>Shrutis, Smrutis. Bhagavaan</em> did <em>sankalpa</em> and said &rsquo; <em>Bahu syaam</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;Let Me become many&rsquo;, and He became many. He made Himself Himself. <em>Svasya kaaryasya svayam eva kaaranam iti sukrutam</em>. Without any strain or effort, He just did <em>sankalpa</em> and became many,  [[423]] without any <em>aayaasa</em>; that is why it is called <em>sukruta</em>. For His effect, He Himself is the cause. The world is not different from Him. This is established in the <em>Brahma Sutra</em>, &rsquo; *Tat ananyatvam aarambhana shabdaadibhyah&rsquo;. *<em>Shruti</em> says &rsquo; <em>Mruttiketyeva satyam</em>&rsquo;, everything is <em>mrut aatmaka</em>, all effects are made from mud. Like this, everything is <em>bhagavat aatmaka</em>. And is <em>Smrutis</em>, it is told in <em>Vishnu Puraana, Jyoteemshi Vishnuh</em>, the various sources of light like fire, sun, moon, stars, etc. everything is <em>Vishnu</em> only; this is in <em>saamaanaadhikaranya</em>; like <em>Tat tvam asi</em>, everything is *bhagavat *<em>aatmaka</em>, there is nothing which can shine without Him, *Tasya bhaasaa *<em>sarvam idam bibhaati</em>, so, everything can be said to be Him only. Not only that, You are very different and distinct from this entire world, You are seen as <em>Tripaat roopa</em>. It is told in *Purusha Sookta, Paadosya vishvaa *<em>bhootaani tripaadasyaamrutam divi</em>. There is nothing which is different from Him, who is different from everything; <em>Bhagavat svaroopa</em> is like that. Though He is everything, He is <em>antaryaami</em>, the inner controller of everything. Being all pervading, He is different and distinct from everything. He is untouched by any of the defects, and is having innumerable auspicious qualities, His nature is opposed to everything that is defiling, He is all pervading, controls everything, everything is His mode being His *shareera. *<em>Tri</em> has the meaning of <em>bahutva</em>, three feet, like *Sahasra sheershaa *<em>purushah, sahasraakshah sahasra paat</em>. The <em>sheersha, aksha, paat</em> are indicative of <em>jnyaana</em> and <em>shakti</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, which is incomparable. He is endowed with innumerable auspicious qualities. He is different and distinct from everything. During <em>pralaya</em>, the entire world is present in Him, in the form of a seed, like a tree is present inside a seed. He does *sankalpa, *<em>&lsquo;Bahu syaam</em>&rsquo; and the whole world is created. He does <em>anupravesha</em> and becomes everything.</p>
<p><em>Dhruva</em> eulogizes <em>Paramaatman</em> as &lsquo;Everything is present in You, and You are not different from the world&rsquo;.</p>

He Himself is the bliss, He is the object of such bliss, or He creates such bliss in others, both can be told. <em>Shruti</em> says &rsquo; *Vijnyaanam *<em>aanandam brahma</em>&rsquo;, He is of the nature of <em>aananda</em>, abundant <em>aananda</em>, unlimited unparalleled bliss. One who does <em>upaasanaa</em> on <em>Paramaatman</em>, here itself, he gets <em>amruta</em>, liberated; there is no other way. His nature itself is <em>aananda</em>. When the <em>mukta</em> gets liberated and goes to <em>Paramaatman</em>, through <em>Paramaatman&rsquo;s anugraha</em>, he goes and joins <em>Paramaatman</em>, who is <em>aananda maya</em>, of the nature of innumerable bliss; having attained the <em>Paramaatman</em> through His grace, he also becomes <em>aanandi</em>; he enjoys the bliss equally as that if <em>Paramaatman</em>.</p>

<p>This is the <em>phala shruti</em> for the <em>Dhruva Charitra</em>. This <em>charitra</em> is said to be very auspicious, and doing <em>paaraayana</em> of this everyday, one gains a lot of benefit. They will never fall down from all their positions. They will be endowed with all auspicious things. They will live for a long time.</p>

<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we had concluded the Twelfth Chapter, where <em>Dhruva</em> after doing <em>tapas</em> attains a very exalted place, the abode of  [[438]] all the three worlds. Because of his <em>tapas</em>, and because of <em>Bhagavaan</em> being pleased with him, even <em>Dhruva&rsquo;s</em> mother is always residing next to him as a shining star.</p>
<p>Next, <em>Dhruva&rsquo;s</em> posterity is going to be told, specifically <em>Vena</em>, and *Pruthu *<em>Chakravarthy&rsquo;s</em> stories are going to be told. The greatness of *Pruthu *<em>Chakravarthy</em> will be told in this chapter.</p>
