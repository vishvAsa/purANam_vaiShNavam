<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying how ten <em>Prachetasaas</em> did tapas for ten thousand years, under water and <em>Mahaa Vishnu</em> appeared in front of them, and gave them the boon that they want to continue mankind as per their father&rsquo;s orders. Brahma had told their father that mankind has to be continued. <em>Bhagavaan</em> is very pleased with their tapas. After they come out of water, they see that the entire earth is filled with trees, which have grown too high, and even air is not able to blow, everything is blocked and choked, people are dying. They get very angry, and create <em>Agni</em> and <em>Vaayu; Agni</em> burns everything, and <em>Vaayu</em> dries up the trees, and everything starts getting destroyed. <em>Soma</em> who is the king of the trees comes in front of them, and says that there is a lady called <em>Maarisha</em>. Knowing the future that she is going to be your wife, I have protected her with my rays, and nurtured her. ***</p>

In the unbroken tradition of <em>Guru</em> and <em>Shishya</em>, that secret <em>upadesha</em> is taught, this is told in <em>Chaandogya</em>, how it is passed on from <em>aachaarya</em> to <em>shishya</em>, in the unbroken tradition of *aachaarya shishya *<em>paramparaa</em>, that can also be taken as meaning of *Paaram param. Bhagavad *<em>Geetha pramaana</em> is also given here - where <em>Krishna</em> says to <em>Arjuna</em> that whatever <em>yoga</em> He is teaching him is taught in the *guru shishya paramparaa. *<em>Apaara paara</em> is explained as unending powers - <em>Vishnu</em> has got *ananta *<em>shakti</em>, that which cannot be told fully; this is told in <em>Upanishads</em> in many ways; His <em>paraa shakti</em> is manifold, it is natural to Him; He is *sarva shakta, *<em>ananta shakta</em>. There is no end to Him. He is of incomparable proportion. He is <em>sarva vyaapta, vibhu</em>. Nobody can know Your greatness, He is *vibhu *<em>svaroopa</em>, and He is *gunatah bruhatvam, svaroopatah *<em>bruhatvam.</em> Or, <em>yajnya</em> and other <em>karmaas</em>, when they are not yet completed, He makes it complete when one does His <em>keertana</em>, or <em>smarana</em>, this is also the meaning of <em>apaara paarah</em>. Those <em>braahmanaas</em> who realize <em>Krishna</em> as He is, all their <em>yajynaas</em> are as good as completed. Just Your <em>naama sankeertana</em> will make everything fulfilled. He is superior to <em>Brahma</em> and others in the aspects of He is the single cause of everything, He is <em>upaadaana kaarana, nimitta kaarana, sarva kaarana, eka kaarana</em> of the entire <em>jagat, Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and others are created by Him, they are all <em>srujyaas</em>, and He is <em>srashta</em>, His <em>svaroopa</em> is *niratishaya aananda. *<em>Paramaartha roopee</em> is told as He is not like <em>Brahma</em> and others, who also have a limited life span, <em>Brahma&rsquo;s</em> life is a hundred years, and after that he  [[514]] also gets merged into his <em>kaarana</em>, everything gets merged into <em>Paramaatman</em> in <em>praakruta pralaya</em> and again they are all created; though <em>chetanaas</em> are all <em>nitya</em>, eternal, they are born again and again as they are <em>karma vashyaas</em>. Up to <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em>, everyone&rsquo;s lifespan is limited. <em>Paramaatman</em> has divine auspicious <em>divya mangala vigraha</em>, which is eternal unlike <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and others. This *divya mangala *<em>vigraha</em> is the abode of <em>sarva shakti</em>, all powers, it is real and auspicious and eternal. Those who attain Him, they enjoy the bliss of communion with Him, this is <em>parama purushaartha</em> for all. *Brahma paarah *- here, the meaning of word <em>Brahma</em> is <em>prakruti, pradhaana</em>, matter. The word <em>brahma</em> is used in many senses even in the <em>Shrutis</em> and <em>Smrutis</em>. He is the ultimate, the end of <em>pradhaana</em>, that is, that <em>pradhaana</em> also merges into Him during <em>pralaya</em>. Or it can also be taken as that the <em>vaidikaas</em> who have mastered the <em>Vedaas</em>, He nurtures, looks after, protects them. Meaning of <em>para</em> is the *samashti *<em>purusha</em>, the collectivity of all the sentients; during <em>pralaya</em>, all sentients are merged into *avyakta. Avyaktam akshare leeyate, aksharam tamasi *<em>leeyate</em>. In a form which cannot be differentiated as to what is <em>pradhaana</em>, what is <em>chetana</em>, they go and stay with <em>Paramaatman</em>, as though with *ekee *<em>bhaava</em>. How can be <em>chetanaas</em> be told as <em>para</em>, means with respect to <em>avyakta</em>, they can be told as <em>para</em>, they are superior to the <em>avyakta</em>. He is the cause of <em>pradhaana</em> and <em>chetanaas</em>; both of them go and merge into <em>Paramaatman</em>, they go and stay one with Him. <em>Samashti purushaas</em> also go and join unto <em>Paramaatman</em>. He is the One who is the abode of even that during <em>pralaya</em>, everything merges unto Him. Or, one more meaning can be told as all those objects which are mutually different, they don&rsquo;t get mixed up, there are innumerable <em>chetanaas</em>, and every <em>chetana</em> when created will have its own body, whether it is *keeta, manushya, deva, gandharva, *<em>yaksha,</em> the individual <em>karmaas</em> are all maintained, and there is no mixing up of anybody&rsquo;s karma with anybody else; this is called <em>asaankarya</em>. For mutually different objects, He maintains their <em>svabhaava, svaroopa</em>, separately without any two getting mixed up. He is also superior to <em>nityaas</em> and <em>muktaas</em>, because He is the cause of the entire world, and <em>nityaas</em> and <em>muktaas</em> cannot create, and cannot involve in <em>srushti</em>; in those aspects, <em>Bhagavaan</em> is superior to them, and also He is the master of all, and everything is <em>shesha bhoota</em> to Him. *Paara paarah *- first word <em>paara</em> means <em>kaala</em>, He is the resting place, or controller of <em>kaala</em> also;  [[515]] everything is resting in Him, and He is ultimate, where all realities go and stay with Him, being supported by Him, and controlled by Him. <em>Kaala</em> is the controller of everything in this *prakruti *<em>mandala. Kaala</em> has no control in <em>Parama Pada</em>, where <em>Paramaatman</em> controls everything there. He is also the fulfiller of even <em>vyoma</em> and others, <em>vyoma</em> is said to be <em>vibhu, aakaasha</em>, He is <em>antaryaami</em> of <em>aakaasha</em> also; where <em>aakaasha</em> does not exist, He exists; He is <em>vibhu</em>. Everything is filled with <em>Paramaatman</em> only. He is also the protector of the protectors. But for <em>Hari</em>, who is all protector, nobody else can protect. Without His <em>sankalpa</em>, nobody can even protect anyone else.</p>
<p>In this one <em>shloka, Kandu Maharshi</em> eulogizes <em>Paramaatman</em> as superior to everything else, <em>svetara samasta vilakshana</em>, He is <em>Parama Sheshi</em>. Starting with everything, *avyakta, pradhaana, samashti purushaas, muktaas, *<em>nityaas, kaala, aakaasha</em>, everything is controlled by Him, and everything rests in Him. He is the sole creator of this entire world. He is superior to <em>Chaturmukha Brahma</em> and others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we had studied about how <em>Maitreyar</em> asks two doubts to <em>Paraasharar</em>, when he started to talk about *Daksha. *<em>Daksha</em> was born to <em>Prachetasaas</em>, and earlier was also born to <em>Brahma</em> of his right thumb which was in a different <em>manvantara</em> the *Swaayambhuva *<em>Manvantara</em>; now it is *Chaakshusha Manvantara *- this is how <em>Paraasharar</em> clarified that doubt. Then <em>Maarishaa</em> the daughter of <em>Soma</em>, and <em>Daksha</em> is the grandson. It is told that <em>Soma</em> marries <em>Daksha&rsquo;s</em> daughter. This seems like there are some inconsistencies here. All these are clarified by <em>Paraasharar</em>, as during those times, there was no concept of elder and younger for <em>rishis</em> and <em>devaas</em>, they were all very exalted and had lot of knowledge, they used to live for a long time; elder or younger was decided based on the knowledge they had and their superior powers. <em>Daksha</em> and others are born again and again, in every <em>yuga</em> and <em>manvantara</em>. Like this, all the doubts are clarified. Now, <em>Maitreyar</em> asks <em>Paraasharar</em> about *Daksha&rsquo;s *<em>srushti</em>.</p>

<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 15, Shloka 153: <br>
Shambarasya cha maayaanaam sahasra mati maayinah |<br>
Yasmin prayuktam chakrena krishnasya vitatheekrutam ||*** He called <em>Shambaraasura</em> and asked him to use his <em>maayaa shakti</em>; he created thousands of wonderful illusions to hurt <em>Prahlaada</em>, but *Krishna&rsquo;s *<em>Sudarshana Chakra</em> came and destroyed all the <em>maayaas</em> of <em>Shambaraasura</em>,  [[535]] and they all became futile. <em>Shambaraasura</em> could not touch him with his <em>maayaa</em>.</p>

<p>***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 15, Shloka 154: <br>
Daityendra soodopahrutam yasya haalaahalam visham |<br>
Jaarayaamaasa matimaan avikaaram amatsari || ***He had no jealousy, and was the one endowed with great knowledge because of his deep meditation on Vishnu. The attendants of <em>Hiranyakashipu</em> gave him <em>haalaahala</em> poison, very powerful poison; <em>Prahlaada</em> digested all of them, without any <em>vikaara</em>. He had no reaction, and he simply digested the poison.</p>
<p>***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>
Daityendra iti | Haalaahalam visham | * Nadee halahalaa naama<br>
tajjam haalaahalam visham * iti aayurvede || ***There is a river called <em>Halahala</em>, and what is born from there is called <em>Haalaahala visha</em>. ***</p>

<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 15, Shloka 155: <br>
Samachetaam jagati asmin yah sarveshu eva jantushu |<br>
Yathaa aatmani tathaa anyeshaam param maitra gunaanvitah ||*** In respect of all beings, he was equally positioned, in this world. With respect to others, he was disposed as though towards himself. He was very friendly with respect to everyone.</p>
<h2 id="156">156</h2>
<p>***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 15, Shloka 156: <br>
Dharmaatmaa satya shouchaadi gunaanaam aakarah parah |<br>
Upamaanam asheshaanaam saadhoonaam yah sadaa abhavat || ***He was a <em>dharmaatmaa</em>, always following the path of <em>dharma</em>. He was the abode of all excellent qualities, <em>satya, shoucha</em>. He was <em>upamaana</em> for all the <em>saadhus</em>, all the time. All the <em>saadhus</em> were compared only with <em>Prahlaada</em>.</p>
<p><em>Paraasharar</em> talks about how <em>Prahlaada</em> was deeply immersed in the thought of <em>Vishnu</em>, and nothing could touch him or shake him. All the tricks that <em>Hiranyakashipu</em> tried on him failed.  [[536]]</p>
<p>This concludes the Fifteenth Chapter.</p>
