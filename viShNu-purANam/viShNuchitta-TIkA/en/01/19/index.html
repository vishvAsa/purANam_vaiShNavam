Natural allies are mother&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s children, etc. All those who are in this world, who are not included among enemies, are <em>praakruta mitraas</em>. If a king has donated a lot of money to someone, he will be friendly with them, and they are friendly because of the donation received; those who are honoured will also have a friendly feeling, are artificial friends. Enemies are also of three kinds - natural are those who are waiting to snatch a part which is inherited, <em>praakruta</em> are those enemies existing in this world, artificial enemies are those to whom we have done something bad, wrong or <em>apakaara</em>. King should be aware of these three kinds of enemies. Those who are unconcerned, the <em>madhyasthaas</em> are also of three types. Three  [[585]] worlds are explained as <em>mitra, ari</em> and *madhyastha *- those who are friendly, those who are enemies, and those who are not concerned (neither enemies nor friends). There is a <em>paatha trishu kaaleshu</em> instead of <em>trishu lokeshu</em>. Three times means, when there is lot of prosperity, when there is lot of famine, and when things are normal. How should a king be working in these three times? This is said to be of seven kinds, as told in <em>Manu Smruti</em>. A king should be having seven attributes or qualities, the qualities of *Indra, Surya, *<em>Vaayu, Yama, Varuna, Chandra</em> and <em>Pruthivi. Indra</em> causes rains for four months during the rainy season; a king showers benefits similarly on his kingdom - this is called <em>varshana</em>. Sun, Surya draws up the water, and similarly a king collects taxes - this is <em>aadaana</em>. A king enters his enemies armies through spies and other means, just as <em>Vaayu</em> enters into beings and conquers them, this is <em>anupravesha. Yama</em> is an impartial judge, just like this, the king also rules over the kingdom maintaining justice, punishes the wicked and protects the virtuous ones, this is *maadhyasthya. *<em>Varuna</em> punishes sinners with <em>Varuna paasha</em>, a king also punishes the wicked, <em>Varuna</em> surrounds all around, and in a similar way a king protects all round, this is <em>poornatva</em>. Moon is pleasant to the whole world, and similarly a king causes happiness and joy to all the citizens, this is <em>priyatva. Pruthivi</em>, earth is known for forbearance, <em>kshamaa</em> is the name of earth itself, a king should also have this quality, this is <em>sahishnutva</em>. The various things that a king should do, and how he should rule over a kingdom, are told. ***</p>

Others ( <em>itareshu</em>) are those who want to do good to the king, who are favourable to him; those who join the king&rsquo;s administration will be tested for their adherence to *dharma, artha *(money - can they be lured by offering bribe), <em>kaama</em>, fear; and those who have passed all these tests, they are also included in <em>itareshu</em>.</p>

A king has to be very careful about such people - they are one who has not got his salaries, one who is greedy, one who is too much egoistic, one who has been disrespected, one who is very angry and does not have control over his anger, one who is very scared - these come under the category of <em>bhedyaas.

<p>These are all forms of Vishnu only. But they are seen as separated. We see a tree separately, an animal separately, a man separately, etc. as though present distinctly. But, they are all <em>Ananta&rsquo;s roopa</em> only, <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s</em> forms. ***<br>

It is not that there is <em>bhagavat aatmaka</em> and there is <em>abhagavat aatmaka</em>; everything is <em>bhagavat aatmaka</em>. Everything is having only <em>Paramaatman</em> as the <em>aatman</em>. Krishna says &rsquo; <em>Na tat asti vinaa yat syaat mayaa bhootam charaacharam</em>&rsquo; - movables and immovables which are not having Me as the inner self, does not exist. Everything is <em>bhagavat aatmaka</em> only. All these forms, though seen as separate, are all forms of Vishnu only, who is all pervasive, and existing as inner controller of everything.</p>

The *Purusha *<em>Sookta mantraas</em> are told here - He is superior to the world, ten thousandth part of a ten thousandth part is this world ( <em>ayuta</em> means ten thousand), everything is controlled through His <em>sankalpa</em> itself. He stays in everything as <em>antaryaami</em>, and is different and distinct.</p>
<p><em>Sarvatra asou vasati samastam cha atra vasati</em>, everything lives in Him, and He lives in everything, and He is different and distinct from everything, He  [[604]] is untouched by the defects of all these, and everything is inseparably associated with Him, and He is inner controller. He is the supporter. Everything is meant for His use, and He is the master who enjoys everything. He is the ultimate enjoyer and bestower of all fruits. Everything is also present in such a way that nothing is present independent of Him. Everything is dependent on Him. There is nothing which is not <em>brahmaatmaka</em>.</p>

Namah tasmai namah tasmai namah tasmai mahaatmane |<br>
Naama roopam na yasya asti yo astitvena na upalabhyate || ***I do <em>namaskaara</em> to Him, that <em>mahaatman</em>. He does not have name and form, He is there and present all the time. He cannot be told as only this form or this name. He is present in all names and in all forms, in any <em>prakaara</em>.</p>
<p>*Apakshaya vinaashaabhyaam parinaamarddhi janmatah varjitah shakyate *<em>vaktum yah sadaa asti iti kevalam</em>, will come later. The *shat bhaava *<em>vikaaraas</em> present for everyone, *asti *(is present), *jaayate *(gets born), *vardhate *(grows), *viparinamate *(gets modified), *apaksheeyate *(deteriorates), *nashyati *(gets destroyed); <em>Bhagavaan</em> does not have any of these. If these *shat bhaava *<em>vikaaraas</em> are not there, how can anyone tell Him in any way? It is possible to tell, He is always present; that is the only way in which He can be told.</p>

Namo astu vishnave tasmai yasya abhinnam idam jagat |<br>
Dhyeyah sa jagataam aadyah sa praseedatu me avyayah ||*** This world is not different from Him. He is only present in all these forms. All these are His modes. One who is present before this whole world, He is the sole creator, He is the <em>jagat kaarana</em>. The cause of this whole world - is to be meditated upon. That immutable one, let Him be pleased with me.</p>
<p><em>Shruti</em> says <em>Kaaranam tu dhyeyah</em> - who is to be meditated upon, *kascha *<em>dhyeyah</em>, is the question posed, and the answer given is *kaaranam tu **dhyeyah *- the One who is the cause of this universe - is to be meditated upon. Because if one has to escape from this world, one has to take refuge in the Creator only. Only the Creator can make someone get out of this creation.</p>

In the <em>Shruti, Taittiriya Braahmana</em>, it is told that the whole world is placed in <em>Bhagavaan</em>. There is a nice example as to how it is placed, when someone travels by ship or boat, everything, people and things are loaded onto that, and place inside. Just like this, the sentients and non-sentients are placed in <em>Bhagavaan</em>.</p>
<p>When crossing over the ocean, all the <em>chetana</em> and <em>achetana</em>, people and things, are kept inside the ship. In the same way, the whole world of sentients and insentients are all placed in <em>Paramaatman</em>, it is said.</p>

<p>The next <em>shloka</em> is a wonderful <em>shloka</em> quoted by our <em>aachaaryaas</em>, and it shows <em>Prahlaada&rsquo;s</em> way of meditation. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 84: <br>
Om namo vishnave tasmai namah tasmai punah punah |<br>
Yatra sarvam yatah sarvam yah sarvam sarva samshrayah || ***<em>Prahlaada</em> prays to Vishnu with the <em>Vishnu Shadakshara mantra</em>, again and again I pay obeisance to Him. Everything is established in whom, and everything is created from whom, one who is everything, He is the abode of everything. To Him, I pay obeisance.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we were studying <em>Prahlaada Charitam</em>, about how <em>Prahlaada</em> started to worship, meditate upon <em>Paramaatman</em> during the <em>aaraadhana kaala</em>, inside the ocean when he was completely covered with huge boulders. He started to pray to <em>Bhagavaan</em> sensing that the time of <em>aaraadhana</em> has come.</p>

<p>This is the wonderful experience of <em>Prahlaada</em> that we see here. What is told in the <em>Upanishads</em> as <em>Ahamgrahopaasana</em>, he experiences that. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 85: <br>
Sarva gatvaat anantasya sa eva aham avasthitah |<br>
Mattah sarvam aham sarvam mayi sarvam sanaatane || ***One who is present in everything as the inner self, He is <em>Ananta</em>. I am also present as Him only. Everything is created from Me only. I am only everything. Everything is existing in Me.</p>
<p><em>Shruti</em> says <em>Satyam jnyaanam anantam brahma</em>. He has *desha kaala vastu *<em>pariccheda raahitya</em>; He is present in all objects at all times, in all places. There is no place where He is not there. There is no object in which He is not there. There is no time in which He is not there. He is all pervading.</p>
<p>This is <em>Ahamgrahopaasana</em>, as <em>Nammaazhvaar</em> also says. *Rishi *<em>Vaamadeva</em> also experiences this, as told in the *Upanishads. *<em>Prahlaada</em> experiences <em>Vishnu</em> in himself. This is an &rsquo; <em>Aham Brahmaasmi</em>&rsquo; kind of experience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>

He is present all the time. One who is different and distinct from inert objects, non sentient objects. He is <em>Sat, Chit, Aananda svaroopa</em>. He is <em>jnyaana aananda svaroopa</em>, always present. He is present in me, <em>brahmaatmakatvena</em>, He is inner self of me also. How he is experiencing this is because <em>Ananta</em> is all pervading, present everywhere. <em>Prahlaada</em> is experiencing the all pervasiveness of <em>Paramaatman</em>.</p>

<p>***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 19, Shloka 86: <br>
Aham eva akshayo nityah paramaatmaa aatma samshrayah |<br>

He Himself is support for Himself. Before <em>srushti</em> also, I am <em>Brahmaatmaka</em>, after <em>pralaya</em> also.</p>

The <em>Upanishad</em> says &rsquo; *Yato vaa imaani bhootaani jaayante, yena *<em>jaataani jeevanti</em>&rsquo; - from Whom this whole world is created, all these beings are created, and all these live because of Whom; sustenance and everything is from <em>Paramaatman</em> only. How can <em>Prahlaada</em> say that &lsquo;Everything is created from me&rsquo; when the <em>Upanishad</em> says that everything is created from <em>Brahman</em>? Everything is created from <em>Brahman</em>. The answer is that &lsquo;I am called as <em>Brahma</em>&rsquo;, this is <em>Brahmaatmakatva</em>. Because I have <em>Brahman</em> as my <em>aatman</em>, I myself can be called as <em>Brahma. Prahlaada</em> is experiencing <em>Paramaatman</em> as the <em>antaryaami</em>, and he is doing that <em>anusandhaana</em>. Everywhere <em>Paramaatman</em> is present as the inner self, and when one starts to meditate upon the <em>Brahmaatmakatva</em> of <em>Paramaatman</em>, they themselves will think as <em>Brahma</em>. This is the kind of experience called <em>Ahamgrahopaasana</em>. This is what <em>Prahlaada</em> experienced here.</p>
