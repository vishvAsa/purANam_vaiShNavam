<p><em><strong>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 1, Chapter 13, Shloka 68:</strong></em> <em><strong>Tvam no vrutti prado dhaatraa prajaa paalo niroopatih |</strong></em> <em><strong>Dehi nah kshut pareetaanaam prajaanaam jeevanoushadheeh ||</strong></em> Now, you have been told to be the king, make us get all the good things. We want to live happily. We are all suffering from hunger, and need to have food.</p>
<p>They come and tell <em>Pruthu</em> that the people are suffering and need to be looked after. The story continues further.</p>
<p><em><strong>Recap</strong></em>: In the previous session, we had studied about the birth of <em>Pruthu</em>, son of <em>Vena</em>, when they churned his right hand. <em>Sootha</em> and <em>Maagadha</em> were also created there; they were asked to praise the great <em>Chakravarthy</em>; they said that they don&rsquo;t know his qualities and deeds; then the <em>rishis</em> said that whatever deeds he is going to do in future, and whatever good qualities he is going to be endowed with in future, praise them. Then they praise King <em>Pruthu</em> with all the good qualities he will have, and all the good deeds he is going to do. <em>Pruthu</em> takes a vow that he is going to cultivate all these good qualities, and give up all the bad qualities, and that he will also do all those deeds that they have told of him. <em>Sootha</em> and <em>Maagadha</em> whatever qualities they told thus, he took all those in his mind and started to cultivate those qualities, and also performed all the deeds that they told of him.</p>

All the people approached him, and were suffering from hunger. Because, when <em>Vena</em> did not allow anyone to do <em>yaagaas</em> and other good deeds, and after his death, there was no rule and order in the kingdom, all the plants and trees got destroyed. He asked them &lsquo;Why have you come here?&rsquo;. They told him the reason why they have come.</p>

Devaas, munis, daityaas</em> are all the <em>yajamaanaas</em> who perform the <em>yajnya. Soorya, Bruhaspati</em>, etc. were in the form of <em>dogdhru</em>, the person who milks the cow. <em>Indra, Soma</em>, etc. were the calves for the ten groups. <em>Sourvarna, Chandomaya</em>, etc. were the ten vessels. <em>Balam, Tapa</em>, etc. were the ten varieties of milk, this is told in the <em>Maatsya Puraana</em>.</p>

<p><em>Devaas</em> got the cow milked. They are the <em>yajamaanaas</em>. The person who milked was <em>Soorya</em>, for the <em>Devaas</em>. For <em>Munis</em>, the <em>dogdhru</em> was <em>Bruhaspati</em>. For <em>Daityaas</em>, it was <em>Dvimoordha</em>. For <em>Raakashasaas</em>, it was <em>Jatunaabha</em>. For <em>Adris</em>, mountains, it was <em>Meru</em>. For <em>Gandharvaas</em>, it was <em>Vasuruchi</em>. For <em>Uragaas</em>, snakes, it was <em>Dhrutaraashtra</em>. For <em>Yakshaas</em>, it was <em>Suparna</em>. For <em>Pitrus</em>, it was <em>Antaka, Yama</em>. For <em>Tarus</em>, it was <em>Saala</em>. The <em>Vatsa</em>, calf for these were *Indra, Soma, Virochana, Sumaali, Himavat, Chitraratha, *<em>Takshaka, Kubera, Maya, Plaksha</em>, in order. The vessel in which they collected were *Souvarna *(Gold vessel for <em>Devaas</em>), *Chandomaya *(vessel of <em>Veda</em> for <em>Munis</em>), *Aayasam *(vessel iron for the <em>Daityaas</em>), <em>Kaapaala</em> for the *Raakshasaas, Shaila *(crystal) for the *Adris, Padma patra *(lotus leaves) for *Gandharvaas, Alaavu *(gourd) for the *Uragaas, Apakva **mrunmaya *(uncooked earth) for the *Yakshaas, Raajata *(silver vessel) for the <em>Pitrus, Paalaasha</em> for the <em>Tarus</em>. The milk that they obtained from <em>Pruthivi</em>, is the seed for everything; it got converted into whatever they desired - <em>Devaas</em> got <em>bala</em>, superhuman power; <em>Munis</em> milked tapas; <em>Daityaas</em> milked <em>maayaa; Raakshasaas</em> milked <em>rudhira</em>, blood; Mountains milked <em>oshadhees</em> and <em>ratna</em>, gems and trees,  [[475]] plants; <em>Gandharvaas</em> milked <em>gandha; Uragaas</em> milked poison; <em>Yakshaas</em> milked <em>antardhaana</em>, the <em>vidyaa</em> to disappear; <em>Pitrus</em> milked <em>svadhaa</em>; and <em>Tarus</em> milked <em>punah prarohana</em>.</p>
<p><em>Pruthvi</em> said that she would provide everything in the form of milk. This is the seed for all kinds of things digested, and will get converted to whatever they desire. Using the proper <em>dogdhru</em>, with the proper calf, with the proper vessel, they get the desired fruits, the <em>ksheera</em>, milk. <em>Devaas</em> making <em>Soorya</em> as the <em>dogdhru</em>, Indra as the calf, in the golden vessel, they milked <em>bala</em>, superhuman power. <em>Rishis</em>, making <em>Bruhaspati</em> as the <em>dogdhru, Soma</em> as the calf, <em>Vedaas</em> as the vessel, milked <em>tapas</em>. Like this, each of the ten groups is told.</p>
