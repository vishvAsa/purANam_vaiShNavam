*Sri Paraasharar* - The third pralaya, which is *Aatyantika pralaya, moksha*, \(the other ones being *naimittika* and *praakruta pralayaas*\), was told to you.

I have known the three groups, three *shaktis*, and have also known completely three kinds of *bhaava bhaavanaas*. 



The three groups what I have learnt are those responsible for creation, sustenance and dissolution - 1. *Brahma, Daksha Prajaapati* and others, who are responsible for creation, 2. *Vishnu*, who Himself does His *avataara*, *Manu*, who do sustenance, 3. *Rudra, Kaala* who are responsible for dissolution. I have come to know these three groups. 



 [[173]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 There is also a *paatha* where *chaturvidha raashi* is told, four groups, where we have to put *Bhagavaan* also. 



*Vishnushaktih paraa proktaa*, which is *jeevaatmans, pradhaana* \(unmanifest matter\), *vyakta* \(manifest matter\), *kaala*. 



I have also come to know the *bhaavanaas*, the *Brahma bhaavanaa, karma **bhaavanaa*, and *ubhaya bhaavanaa*.

With your grace, I have learnt everything. This is sufficient for me. There is nothing else to know. What is that I have known is that this entire world is not different from *Paramaatman, Vishnu*. Because everything is having Him as the inner self. Everything is *Bhagavadaatmaka*. Everything is not different from *Vishnu*. Nothing can exist separately from *Vishnu*, because they are inseparably associated with Him, and He is the inner self of everything. This is what I have known.

Please do pardon me for that. I plead *kshamaa* from you. For *sajjanaas*, wise people, they do not differentiate between their son and student. Please pardon me if I have subjected you to the difficulty of teaching all these things.

*Sri Paraasharar* - Whatever I have told you, O *Maitreyar*, is equal to *Veda* only. All the defects, wrong things, *doshaas* which have come, whatever has accrued, that entire heap of sin, *paapa*, gets destroyed, while one listens to this. Not only if one does willingly, but also done out of wrong desire, passion, the sins accumulated due to all of that, everything gets completely destroyed, if one listens to this sacred *Puraana*, which is equal to Veda only.

Just like a deer which is having a great scare of a lion, gets rid of all the fear, like that, the sins will immediately go away. 



The greatness of *Vishnu naama sankeertana*, without one's knowledge, or in whatever state he is, when the mind is not in control also, if we just chant His names, that itself will make one get rid of all the sins. A comparison is given - the deer which has come near a lion, and which is very terrified, if it is saved from the lion, and taken to safety, how much comfort it feels; like that, we have accumulated sins from beginningless time, all our sins will get destroyed just by chanting the sacred divine names of *Sri Mahaavishnu*. 



The greatness of the *naama sankeertana*, will be told next. The *phala* of listening to this and studying this work will be told. Which we see next. 



With the grace of *Bhagavaan Sri Vishnu* and our *Aachaaryaas*, we have been able to study this work, and now is the concluding session, and *Mangalaacharane*. We will listen to the *phalashruti* that *Sri Paraasharar* is going to tell. 



We are studying Chapter 8 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is telling Sri *Maitreyar* what all he has told so far, what all is being taught in this *Sri Vishnu* *Puraanam* - everything about the sacred land of India, the whole earth *Pruthivi*, the lands, the sacred rivers, the mountains, the stories of lives of great people, great kings and rishis, what all wonderful acts they did during their lifetime, what all we can learn from them, and many people eulogized *Sri Mahaavishnu* as we can see, and the *sarveshvaratva, sarvashaktitva, sarvaniyantrutva* of *Sri* *Mahaavishnu*, how everything is created, sustained, and dissolution also, which happens by Him only, and also about *varna aashrama dharmaas*, about *Vedashaastraas* - how it was one, and then divided into four, and then propagated through the *aachaarya shishya paramparaa* - all this is present here, as *Sri Paraasharar* is telling. He will tell about the greatness of *naama* *sankeertana*, and also the various *phalaas* which come to one who listens and propagates this.

... in *Jyestha maasa, Shukla paksha, dvaadashi tithi*, he gets the fruit of *Ashvamedha yaaga*. The *pitrus* and *pitaamahaas* say - "Will there be anyone born in our kula, like this, who is going to get us also this fruit, *punya loka, punya phala*. will we also get this kind of a *vruddhi*", having seen the prosperity of the other *pitrus* who are there. 



The meaning of great prosperity means that he will get *moksha*. The *pitrus* talk like this - will anyone be born in our kula who will get us moksha. By listening to one *adhyaaya*, the *pitrus* are all saved, and they get liberated.

Because of the *varadaana* of *Pulastya*, I also remembered this. I have taught you as it is, O *Maitreya*. 



The story of *Pulastya* and *Vasishtha*, we saw in the very beginning, where *Pulastya* and *Vasishtha* come to *Paraasharar* and they give him the boon of *Bhagavat yaathaatmya jnyaana*, and he will know all the *Puraanaas*. How *Paraasharar* also got this through *sampradaaya*, is explained in the commentary. Earlier, it was told that Saarasvata only taught this. Based on this, he says that he learnt this. In the *Kruta yuga*, all the *Puraanaas* were connected together, and it was called Brahma *Puraana, Brahma samjnyaa. Chaturmukha Brahma* gave this to *Daksha*, and like this, it came up to *Purukutsa. Paraasharar* in *Treta yuga*, collected the *Vishnu* *Puraana*, and there was a lot of time loss, a lot of gap in between, and it got lost in between. Again, *Paraasharar* through his *tapas*, he did *saakskaatkaara* of this, and that was being obtained by *Chaturmukha* *Brahma*, was taught through *Rubhu* and *Jaaturkarna*. This is another *sampradaaya*. Again it was propagated in *triloka*. What is told here, from *Chaturmukha Brahma*, through *Rubhu*, etc., is another *sampradaaya*. In the 28th *yuga*, where *Maitreyar* is asking *Paraasharar*, and in the previous *janma* of *Paraasharar*, he had learnt it from *Saarasvata*, and in this birth, *Paraasharar* through *Vasishtha* and *Pulastya's* *varadaana*, he remembered it again, a small part of it only, and became reduced  [[184]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 in size. So, there is no *sampradaaya viccheda*. Through *Paraasharar* only, it came first, and through *Chaturmukha Brahma*, what *Paraasharar* had done *saakskaatkaara*, that only was taught to *Rubhu* and others. So, there is no *sampradaaya viccheda*, no break in the *sampradaaya. Sri Paraasharar*, when he was in the womb of his mother itself, remembered the *Veda mantraas*. The story says that *Vasishthar* wanted to end his life, as he was feeling very sad that there was nobody to continue his *vamsha*, when his son was killed by *raakshasaas*. At that time, he heard a *Vedamantra*, and his daughter-in-law, his son *Shakti's* wife, said that she was pregnant. *Paraasharar*, when in the womb itself knew the *Vedamantraas*. He remembered the *Vedaas* heard in some other *janma*, in the *garbha* itself. In the same way, he can remember the *Puraanaas* also. How *Puraana kartrutva* is obtained by *Sri Paraasharar* is told as - In the 26th *yuga*, he became a *Vyaasa*, it has come from there, and through *Pulastya vara*, he taught it. That is how he became the *kartaa* of *Sri Vishnu Puraana*.

One who has fixed his mind on *Bhagavaan Vishnu*, who is meditating on Him, the joy of meditation, and thinking of *Bhagavaan*, in front of that, even svarga is an obstruction only, and even the *Brahma loka* is very meagre for one who has established the Lord in his mind, will get moksha itself. There is nothing surprising that when one does the *naama sankeertana* of *Bhagavaan*, all the sins will get totally destroyed. 



The meaning of *mati* is *shravana, manana*, the knowledge out of these. *Chintana* means *dhaarana*, what is told in *yoga. Dhyaana* is also told, controlling the mind inside. Next comes *Samaadhi*. One who does all these will get *moksha* itself. There is nothing surprising that all his sins will get destroyed completely, for one who meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, and does *naama sankeertana*.

Those who are knowledgeable about performing *yajnyaas*, they are *karma* *nishthaas*. They worship *Bhagavaan Vishnu* as *Yajnyeshvara*, all the time with various *yajnyaas*. The *jnyaanis*, the knowledgeable ones, they meditate upon Him, for whom the whole world, *para* and *avara* are His form, or as *Brahman* Himself. One who meditates upon Him, will not be born again, and will not die, and there will be no contraction or expansion of knowledge. Coming into contact with the body is birth, and leaving it is death - these will not be there. No cause and effect will be there; there will be no more birth. This can also be explained for *Bhagavaan*, that there is no cause for Him, just as we see here where the cause undergoes modification and becomes a *kaarya. Bhagavaan* is the immutable  [[187]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 principle. *Bhagavaan* is also the *kaarana* and *kaarya* for the whole world, and He does not undergo any modification like the normal things which we see here. What one should listen to, beyond Hari? There is nothing beyond *Bhagavaan **Hari*, for anyone to even listen to, His *gunagaana* and His *keertana*.

*Bhagavaan* is without beginning and without end. According to *Veda*, whatever is told, in the *vidhi*, they offer *kavya* to *pitrus*, and *Bhagavaan* only receives that in the form of *pitrus*, being *antaryaami* of everything. Whatever is offered as *svadhaa*, whatever is offered to *devataas* by telling *svaahaa*, that *havya*, that also, He only is the ultimate *phalee*, being the *antaryaami* of *devaas* also. He is all pervading, *Vibhu*. The *Parabrahman*, in the actual meaning, in the prime sense, the word *Brahma* denotes *Bhagavaan* only. Because it is *bruhatva* through *svaroopa* and *guna*, and everything *bruhat, Brahma*. He is the one who is abode of all the *shaktis*. One who follows the various *pramaanaas*, the *pratyaksha* cannot show *Bhagavaan*, we cannot perceive Him through *anumaana*, we cannot perceive Him through *shabda* also, because He is *Ananta*, we cannot know fully. All the *pramaanaas* are not sufficient to grasp *Bhagavaan's svaroopa*, and *gunaas*, because they are endless and He is all-pervading. Because of this, only *Hari's* sacred divine name, and all His wonderful acts, are to be listened to, and eulogized by anyone.

Through the next four *shlokaas*, the conclusion of the *shaastra* is made. Sri *Paraasharar* is doing *namana* to *Bhagavaan* who is present in four forms, in His own divine auspicious form. ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 8, Shloka 60:  *****नान्तो* *****अस्थत* *****यथय* *****न* *****च* *****यथय* *****समुद्भवो* *****अस्थत* *****वृद्गर्नग* *****यथय* *****पररणामवववस्जगतथय* | *****नापियं* *****च* *****समुपैतत* *****अववकारर* *****वथतु* *****यथतं* *****नतो* *****अस्थम* *****पुरुषोत्तममीशमीड्यम्* *****॥* *****६०* *****॥ *

For performing *mangala*, that all auspicious things should happen, Sri *Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan* who is in the form of *Eeshvara* \(His own form\), *Purusha* \(all the *chetanaas*\), *Pradhaana* \(as *avyakta*, unmanifest matter, *achit*\), *Vyakta* \(as manifest matter\). The first *shloka* of these four, is about *Bhagavaan's* divine auspicious form, which was explained wonderfully in the *Astra Bhooshana adhyaaya*, and by *Keshidhvaja*, about how one has to meditate. *Kaala* is also included in Him. 



He is *aadi anta rahita*, without beginning or end. He does not have *vruddhi*, *parinaama, apakshaya* \(growth, modification, decline\) - the *shat bhaava* *vikaaraas*. He is immutable, unchangeable principle. He is the supreme ruler of all. He is one who is worth eulogizing, *keertana, praarthana*. His name itself is *Purushottama*, He is *uttamah purushah tu anyah*. I bow down to Him.* *We have been graced by our *Aachaaryaas* and *Bhagavaan* to study this wonderful sacred work. So, it is *mangala* for everyone. For this, at the end, *Sri Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan*.

Now, *Sri Paraasharar* does *namana* to *Bhagavaan*, who is present in the form of all the *chetanaas*. He is present in the form of *chetanaas*, all *chetanaas* are His *shareera. Anugunabhuk* means *sheshabhoota*, that they are all subservient to Him. He is One, without any differentiation of *deva, manushya*, etc. He is *jnyaanaikasvaroopa*. When He comes into contact with *prakruti, achetana*, He  [[189]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 will be a *baddha jeeva*, a *samsaari*. Though He is in His real nature, pure and untainted, because of the contact with *prakruti*, because of *karmaas*, He looks as though He is *ashuddha*, impure. Because a *baddha jeeva* thinks that whatever body he is in, that itself is the *aatma*, through *dehaatma bhramaa*, so He looks like *ashuddha*. One *asaadhaarana dharma* of *jeevaatman* is *jnyaaatrutva*, that he has *dharma bhoota jnyaana*., and this is also *svaroopa niroopaka dharma* for him. The *srushti* happens because the *chetanaas* have to experience the fruits of their karma, punya and *paapa. Prakruti* modifies to *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc., by *Bhagavaan's sankalpa*. This is told as *tattva vibhooti kartaa*. These are done by *Bhagavaan* only, because of the *punya paapa* of the *purushaas*. One who does all these is the creator of the world. The *chetanaas* of the world are also His *shareera. Bhagavaan*, who is having the *chetanaas*, who have all these qualities, as His *shareera*, to Him, I bow down. 



The *chetana*, who is *sheshabhoota*, who is *shuddha*, but looks like *ashuddha* when he is in contact with *deva, manushya*, and other *shareeraas*, who has *jnyaaatrutva*, and whose *punya paapa karmaas* are all responsible for all this creation, to *Bhagavaan* who is having such *chetanaas* as His body, His *shareera*, and who is immutable, I bow down to Him always.

The *sattva, rajas, tamas kaaryaas* - the *kaarya* of *tamas* is contraction of knowledge, or obstruction; when *sattva, rajas, tamas* are all in one place, and when they are in equal state, they are called as *avyakta*. When in *pralaya*, the *moola prakruti* is *avyakta*, it is said. *Avyakta shareeraka Paramaatman* is the meaning here. *Prakruti* is responsible for the experiences of all the *chetanaas*, of *punya, paapa*, etc. One who is having the *trigunaatmaka prakruti* as His shareera. He is told as *avyaakruta. Karma*, which is the cause of *samsaara*, and He is the cause of this *karma*, because His *anugraha, nigraha* will cause *punya, paapa*. He is  [[190]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 the one who decides the *punya, paapa* for the *chetanaas* based on their *karmaas*. *Brahma sutraas* say " *aatmakruteh*", that "I will become many", " *bahusyaam*". He is without any beginning, He is there all the time, existing all the time by Himself. This is *Bhagavaan's* form of *avyakta*. 



First is told the divine auspicious form, then *chetana-shareeraka Paramaatman*, then *avyakta-shareeraka Paramaatman*. Next comes *vyakta shareeraka **Paramaatman*. There is nothing which is not *Bhagavadaatmaka*.

This is the *vyakta roopa* of *Paramaatman. Aakaasha, anila, agni, jala, pruthivi*, the five elements of the world, He is only present as *antaryaami*. He is present in those forms. Through *shareera-shareeri bhaava*, the words which connote the *shareera* also go up to the *shareeri*. All the words, through *aparyavasaana vrutti*, all connote *Bhagavaan* only. Everything is *Bhagavaan*, being His *shareera*. He is capable of making all the sense objects which are the objects of enjoyment, through the sense organs for the *chetanaas*, the *shabda, sparsha, roopa, rasa, **gandha*, the objects of enjoyment; and He does *upakaara* to all the *chetanaas*, through all the *indriyaas*. This is the manifest form of *Bhagavaan. Sookshma* form is *mahat* and other things which are in very subtle form. *Bruhat* are *pruthivi*, and others which are being seen. He is the *aatma, antaryaami* of all that. All are His form only. 



*Bhagavaan* is having all the manifest forms of all these as His *shareera*. He is present in those forms being the *aatma, antaryaami*. I bow down to Him. 



In the above four *shlokaas*, the four forms are shown. This shows that everything is *Bhagavaan's* form, that everything is Bhagavadaatmaka.

The *chetana, achetana vastu* means that it is a real object, it is real, the reality principle. He is having everything as His *shareera* means the three relationships, that they are all supported by Him, all are controlled by Him, they are all subservient to Him. He is the Lord of all, He is the *Purushottama. Paraasharar* is blessing all the *chetanaas*, that everyone should get *moksha*. This is the greatness of our sages. *Paraasharar*, with so much of *kaarunya*, is blessing everyone that everyone should get *moksha*. He is completing this *Puraana* like this. As told in all these six *amshaas. Prakruti, para, aatma maya - prakruti* is *vyakta, avyakta* - the manifest and unmanifest; and that which is superior to that is *apraakruta, para*, His divine auspicious form; and *aatma* is all the *chetanaas. Bhagavaan* is *sanaatana*. For all the *chetanaas*, let Him give the *siddhi* which is without any birth and death, the cycle of *samsaara* - let Him give the ultimate liberation, moksha. All the *prakruti, vyakta, avyakta*, are the form of Him only, the unborn; they are His *roopa* only, His *shareera*. Everything are told as Him only, through *saamaanaadhikaranya*, because of the *shareera-shareeri bhaava*. There are many *chetanaas*, there is *aatma bahutva*, and there is *paraspara bheda*, and every *aatman* is different from the other, though they are of similar *svaroopa, jnyaana **svaroopa*. Because *Paraasharar* is praying *Bhagavaan* to grant moksha to everyone, this shows that *Bhagavaan Sri Vishnu* only is the bestower of *moksha*, liberation, and He is *moksha prada*. 



He is *sakala itara samasta vilakshana*. All *chetana achetana vastu* is His *shareera*. *Chetanaas* are many, and everything is real. He is *moksha prada*. Because He is *antaryaami* of everything, and everything is His *shareera*, there is *saamaanaadhikaranya* told that everything is Him only. All this is told here. This is the summary of this *shaastra*. 



*Prakruti* and *Purusha* are different from *Parabrahman*.

With this, the *Vishnuchitteeya*, the commentary by *Sri Vishnuchittar*, or *Sri Engal **Aalwaan*, this most wonderful commentary gets completed. We can see from this commentary that all the *Vishnu Puraana shlokaas* given in the *Sri Bhaashya*, the *Mahaasiddhaanta* part, where *Bhaashyakaarar* has not commented on many *shlokaas*, but has given *udaaharana* of these, at all those places, *Sri Sudarshana* *Suri* has explained these *shlokaas* with the help of *Sri Engal Aalwaan's* *vyaakhyaana* only. *Sri Engal Aalwaan's shishya* was *Sri Nadaadoorammaal*, whose shishya was *Sri Sudarshana Suri. Sri Sudarshana Suri*, what he listened in the *kaalakshepa* from *Sri Nadaadoorammaal*, which is *Shrutaprakaashika*. In this *Shrutaprakaashika*, he enlightens all the *Vishnu Puraana shlokaas* by taking from *Sri Engal Aalwaan's vyaakhyaana* only. So, this is a very very important commentary, very important work for us. *Sri Vishnu Puraana* is quoted profusely by *Sri Bhaashyakaarar* in *Sri Bhaashya*, and in *Vedaarthasangraha*. 



We were really fortunate to study this *Sri Vishnu Puraana*. It was a great opportunity to study this work. 



We offer our *pranaamams* to *Bhagavaan*, and all our *Aachaaryaas*. Our thanks to *Sri Tirunarayana Trust*, to *Sri Sampathkumaran*, *Smt. Sheela, Sri Raman*, who have  [[193]] of 194
