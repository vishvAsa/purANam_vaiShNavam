Because of that, *karma lopa* happens, they don't know what to do, and they perform all kinds of wrong deeds, which are against the *shaastraas*.

This *dukha* is itself like a bright sun burning, and one who is suffering because of that heat, of the nature of the sun, which is nothing but the grief of *samsaara*. He has to take the shade of a tree which is nothing but liberation, *mukti*. There will be no *sukha* otherwise for him.

There is no happiness which is greater than *aatyantika sukha, moksha*. This is extremely pleasant - that kind of happiness he gets. He will not tolerate experience of any other *sukha* other than this *moksha sukha*. The happiness, bliss which he experiences there in moksha is so huge, that there is nothing beyond that. He cannot tolerate any other kind of happiness. Attaining this kind of *sukha* is unparalleled, and this kind of bliss, is the nature of attaining *Bhagavaan*. This bliss is never mixed with even an iota of grief there. It is beyond end, it is eternal. 



After this, *Sri Paraasharar* is going to tell the *Bhagavat shabda nirvachana*, the meaning of the *Bhagavat shabda*. The *ubhaya linga* of *Bhagavaan*. He is  [[76]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 indicating that here. This is the speciality of *Bhagavat praapti*. This is the medicine in order to get cured of the disease of *samsaara*. It is eternal and unparalleled. There is not even an iota of grief.

Because it is of unparalleled bliss, one has to put effort to attain it. One who has the *viveka*, who knows what is right and wrong, has to put effort to attain that kind of bliss. The means to attain that is said to be *jnyaana* and *karma*. 



The three kinds of *taapatraya - aadhyaatmika, aadhidaivika, aadhibhoutika*, to overcome them, He has to be attained. Attaining *Bhagavaan* only is that which destroys all these *taapaas*. Because of this, one has to put efforts to attain it. Those who say that just *vaakyaartha jnyaana* is itself moksha, this is refuted here. *Jnyaana* and *karma* are the means told here. *Karma* is not the main, in *jnyaana*, or also *jnyaana-karma samucchaya* is also not told here. Both being equal means to attain moksha, is also not true. What is told here is that *jnyaana* is only the main means, to attain *Paramaatman*, and *karma* is the *anga* to that. So, it is not without any *karma. Nitya naimittika karmaas* are all *angaas* to that. Later on, it will be told that *Brahma vidyaa* only is to be attained, through *jnyaana*, and performing *karmaas* as *anga*.

*Karma* is there as *anga* to *jnyaana. Jnyaana* is said to be of two types. From yoga, that *jnyaana* which comes through *viveka*. 



That which comes through *aagama*, which is *shabda brahma. Vivekajaa* is *Parabrahman*, the knowledge which comes out of *viveka* is *Parabrahman*. That which comes in *aagama* is *shabda brahma*. These are *shaastra janya jnyaana* and *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana. Viveka jnyaana* is *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. First, *shaastra jnyaana* is obtained by study of *shaastraas*, and then through *upaasanaa, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana* is obtained. *Shabda brahma* is that which comes from *aagama, shaastra janya jnyaana. Vivekajaa* is *upaasanaatmaka* *jnyaana*.

Both these are *Brahma vidyaa* only. The differences between these two kinds of *jnyaana* are told here. In order to refute all those who give the wrong meaning. *Ajnyaana* is before one studies the *shaastraas*, before *shaastra janya jnyaana* comes, it is ignorance. The souls are all covered by *karma*, which is also known as *avidyaa*. The knowledge is covered by *avidyaa*. Because of this, they do not know the real nature of *aatma* and *Paramaatman*. Or, they have understood it wrongly. This is opposed to *jnyaana*, and it is not *jnyaana*. This is like *andha tamas*,  [[78]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 darkness. That *jnyaana* which arises out of *shaastra shravana*, is heard through our ears, and it is *aagama janya*, and is *indriya udbhava*, as it comes through *shaastra shravana*. This is opposed to *ajnyaana*, so it is like a *deepa*. So, when we do *shaastra shravana* through an *aachaarya*, then our *ajnyaana* of *aatma* *Paramaatma yaathaatmya jnyaana* gets dispelled. So, it is said to be a *deepa*, like a light, which reveals things. It is like a light in darkness. This is *aagama janya* *jnyaana*. It also has a little bit of *anyathaa jnyaana*, and it is less only. The comparison between the sun and just a lamp, a lamp has very less brightness compared to the sun, which lights the entire world, so the light of the lamp is *alpa*. The light of lamp, can have a little bit of *anyathaa jnyaana*. The lamp dispels some amount of darkness. *Viveka janya jnyaana*, which is *upaasanaatmaka* *jnyaana*, completely dispels the ignorance and cause of ignorance, which is *avidyaa*, which is like a darkness. Compared to *aagama shaastra janya jnyaana*, it brings in a vivid perception of the Lord. That is why it is said to be like the sun. *Vivekaja* is said to be like *soorya. Aagamaja* is said to be like *deepa*, and this is *indriyodbhava*. 



This is further explained in many *shlokaas*, the two kinds of *jnyaana* as told by *Manu*, by *Mundakopanishad* - all these things are going to be taught by *Sri* *Paraasharar*. Which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 5 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is describing the *aatyantika pralaya*, which is *Moksha*, liberation. Before telling that, he tells about the various kinds of sufferings, which one goes through during birth, death, staying in the womb, in *naraka*, hell, so that one can get *virakti*. One should feel that we do not want any more of all of these, and put an end to these. And then, they seek an *aachaarya*, and adopt the means for liberation. After this, *Sri **Paraasharar* tells about the means for liberation, and also describes the *Bhagavat **svaroopa*, while describing the *upaasanaa*. 



Initially, *shaastra janya jnyaana* is to be got, by studying the *Vedaanta*, the *Upanishads* in detail, and the *Brahma Sutraas*, where one understands the meanings of the teachings of the *Upanishads*, without any contradictions and doubts. Then they can proceed to perform the means. There are two steps - \(i\) to attain the *shaastra janya jnyaana*, \(ii\) to do the *upaasanaa*, which is what leads to *Paramaatma saakshaatkaara*. These are told as *shabda brahma* and *Parabrahma*. *Shabda brahma* is *aagamamaya*, which is *shaastra janya. Parabrahma* is *vivekaja*, through *yoga, upaasanaa*. Both steps are useful. In the first step, one gets the *tattva jnyaana*, and understands the nature of the realities, and understands the means, and how to adopt the means, and what are the fruits which one gets. Then they can perform the *upaasanaa* to attain *Brahman*. However, the first step, *shaastra janya jnyaana* itself will not yield the ultimate fruit, but it will give the  [[79]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 basic knowledge required, the *jnyaana*. This also destroys some of the ignorance with respect to the knowledge of the realities; this is told as a lamp. The *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana* is told as the Sun. The lamp also dispels darkness, but there may be still some doubts, we may not be able to perceive very clearly, and it may not be very bright. And the lamp is dull compared to the Sun. The Sun dispels all the darkness and the cause of the ignorance. 



The first step is *tattva jnyaana* by listening to an *aachaarya*, which is *shravana* *janya*, by listening to the *upadesha* of *Vedaanta vaakya arthaas*. This is *shravana* *janya*, by listening to the *aachaarya*, so it is called *indriyodbhava*. 



*Vivekaja* is like the Sun, the *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*.

*Sri Paraasharar* is telling *Manu's* words also as *pramaana. Sri Paraasharar's* words themselves are *pramaana* to us, and he is quoting *Manu*, so we can understand how valid *Manu's* words are. 



 [[80]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Kevala karma jnyaana* cannot give ultimate *purushaartha*. One who has performed *karmaas* as *anga* to *upaasanaa* is different. He will have Brahma *jnyaana*. Mere *karmaas* which are performed without *jnyaana* of *Brahman*, will only yield very meagre results, svarga and other *phalaas*. If one does not have *Brahma jnyaana*, they will do it for their own purpose, and by worshipping only the deities. They don't know that *Paramaatman* is *antaryaami* to everything, and that everything we worship is *Paramaatman's* worship only. *Paramaatman* is the one who is worshipped through all the *karmaas*; this when they do without the desire for *karma phala*, then only it can lead to liberation. 



One has to know two *Brahmas - Shabda brahma* and *Parabrahma*. Through *upaasana* only can *purushaartha* be obtained, and not by mere *karma*. This is told by *Manu* also. One who has acquired the *shaastra janya jnyaanna*, by the *Vedaanta vaakya vichaara*, without any doubt, without any contradictions, without *samshaya, viparyaya*, will be able to perform the *upaasanaa*, and get the *vivekaja jnyaana, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. He will get vivid perception of the Lord. *Viveka* is *yoga* or *upaasanaa* here.

After quoting *Manu Smruti*, *Sri Paraasharar* gives *Shruti pramaana*. In the *Mundakopanishad*, in the very beginning, *Shounaka* approaches *Aachaarya* *Angirasa*, and asks him about knowing which everything is known. *Angirasa* gives him the knowledge - " *Dve vidye veditavye - paraa cha aparaa cha*". And he says that *Aparaa vidyaa* is *Rigveda, Yajurveda, Saamaveda, Atharvaveda*, and all those things through which *tattva jnyaana* is obtained. So, *Aparaa vidyaa* is not inferior knowledge, it is foundational knowledge. *Paraa vidyaa* is about that *Akshara* *shabdita Paramaatman*, who is attained by that *vidyaa*, which is *upaasanaa*. This is told here as *Aatharvani shruti, Atharva Veda* to which *Mundakopanishad*  [[81]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 belongs. *Smrutis* are all *upabrahmanaas* of *Shruti*, and now, the *Shruti vachana* is being told. Two *vidyaas* are told in the *Aagamaas*. The *Paraa* is *vivekajanya*, that *upaasanaa, yoga* through which *Brahman* is attained. *Parabrahman* is told as *Akshara* here. 



Those who say that mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* is sufficient for attaining *moksha*, they are put aside here. Mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* alone is not sufficient. That is only *aparaa vidyaa*, foundational knowledge, and one has to start with that only. After that, one has to perform *upaasanaa*, in order to attain *Parabrahman*. *Poorva meemaamsakaas* say *karma* alone, and they don't believe in *upaasanaa*, and even *Upanishads* are *arthavaada* for them; that is all refuted here. Those who say that *Parabrahman* can be obtained by mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana*, it is said clearly that this is not possible in the *shaastraas*; because by mere *vaakyaartha* *jnyaana* if one can attain, here itself one should not feel any sorrow or suffering; because anyone can get *vaakyaartha jnyaana* and attain *moksha*. This is against the *Brahma Sutras*. This is also against the *Pratyaksha*, because we can see that so many people study the *vaakyaarthaas*, but all their sufferings are still continuing. *Manu vachana* is most trustworthy, as he was an expert in *Vedaas, **Vedaarthaas*. *Sri Paraasharar* is telling that this is *pramaana*; and *aagama* and *viveka* mean *shaastra janya jnyaana* and *upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*, respectively.

This is also taken from the *Mundakopanishad* *shruti*. This is the *svaroopa* of *Akshara*, one who is attained through *Paravidyaa*. When we split the words, it becomes *Paraa* and *vidyaa*, when we *combine*, it becomes *Paravidyaa*. One who is the object of meditation, through *Paravidyaa*, the ultimate goal who is attained, that *Brahman's svaroopa* is told here. *Avyakta* means that He can be known only through *Shrutis*. None of the other *pramaanaas* can help us to know *Brahman*. *Pratyaksha*, and *Anumaana* are not *pramaanaas* for knowing Brahman.  [[82]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Baadaraayanar* established in the *Brahma Sutraas* that " *Shaastrayonitvaat*", that " *Shaastraika samadhigamyatvam*", this is told as *Avyakta* here. It is only through Shruti that one can know the *Parabrahma svaroopa*.* *



*Achintyam* means that He is beyond thought, that one cannot think of His *svaroopa* completely. One cannot even think or imagine completely. One has to do *chintane*, but cannot do it fully. *Ajaram* and *Ajam* tell about the *vikaara* *raahitya* of *Brahman*, the absence of six-fold modifications which happen to every object, substance, being. The six-fold modifications are *asti, jaayate, vardhate*, *viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati* - the *shat bhaava vikaaraas*. These *vikaaraas* are not there for Brahman. 



Speech and mind cannot perceive fully the nature of *Brahman*, or the qualities or attributes of *Brahman. Avyaya* means that He is without any *vyaya*, He is *vikaara* *rahita. Achintyam* and *anirdeshyam* are telling about *vaang-manasaa*-*agocharatvam; achintyam* is through mind, and *anirdeshyam* is through *vaak*. 



Aroopa means that He does not have *karma kruta shareera* like *deva, manushya*. Or, He has a divine auspicious form, *divya mangala vigraha*, which is *nitya*, eternal. This is called *shubhaashraya. Aroopa* means absence of *deva, manushya* *roopa* which come through *karma*. 



He does not have *paani, paada* \(hands and legs\), which are *praakruta*, as we perceive here.

He is all pervading, He is everywhere. He can move anywhere, He is eternal. He is the cause of the whole world. He does not have a cause. He is existing by Himself. 



He pervades everything. *Vibhutva* can also be told as controllership, *niyantrutva*. He does not have a cause Himself. He is eternally present by Himself. Whatever is  [[83]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 present in this world, in pervaded form, all this is Him only. He is the cause of a *jeeva* to get connected, to get association with a body. 



From whom this whole world consisting of pervaded and pervading, is created. By Him, *Akshara*. There are many attributes told for *Brahman, vibhu, sarvagata*, *nitya, bhootayoni, akaarana, vyaapya vyaaptam yatah*. The *nitya sooris*, who are eternally present, in the *Paramapada*, they always see Him. He is seeable, He is not *adrushya*. He cannot be seen like the *praakruta* objects. 



All these clearly establish that the object of *Paravidyaa*, who is *Akshara*, who has all these attributes, is *saguna* and that this *Paravidyaa* is not about *nirguna* *Brahman*, but about *saguna Brahman*. Those who say that *Paravidyaa* is about *nirguna Brahman* are refuted here. It is about *saguna Brahman* only. This is very clear here.

That which is very subtle, and who is *tejomaya*, is to be meditated upon, by those who are desirous of *Moksha*. 



*Paramapada* has three meanings, told by *Bhagavad Ramanuja* in *Vedaarthasangraha*, and other works - \(i\) *Paramapada* means *Parabrahman* Himself, because *padyate* is *gamyate*, one who is attained, \(ii\) *Paramapada* is the place where *Paravaasudeva* is there all the time, which is *Vaikuntha*, this is also told in the *Shrutis*, \(iii\) *Jeevaatma svaroopa* is also told as *Paramapada*. The one who is meditated upon by those who desire Him is *Parabrahman* only.

The *nirvachana* of *Bhagavaan shabda* is going to be told here. The *Parabrahman* who is qualified by all these wonderful attributes, *saguna Brahman*, is the one who is known by the word *Bhagavaan*. This word denotes *Parabrahman* only. He is the essence of all the *Vedaanta*, and *Sri Engal Aalwaan* quotes many *pramaanaas. Sarvavyaapi* is *Bhagavaan, Naaraayana* is *Bhagavaan, Vaasudeva* is *Bhagavaan*. One should offer self as *havis* by reciting *pranava*. Those who meditate with the *mantra dvaadashaakshara*, is what is told here, the *mantra* *vishesha* meaning. *Om namo bhagavate vaasudevaaya*, is the *dvaadashaakshara* *mantra*. 



The word *tadeva*, is very clearly stressing on the meaning, that the *Bhagavat* *shabda vaachya*, the one who is denoted by the word *Bhagavaan*, is none other than *Parabrahman*, who is the one who can be attained through *Paravidyaa*, and who is the cause of all the worlds, the *jagat kaarana*, and who has the *ubhaya* *linga, sakala heya pratyaneekatva*, and *kalyaana gunaatmakatva*. He is opposed to everything which is defiling, and He is abode to innumerable auspicious qualities. 



*Manu's* words are also quoted here by *Sri Engal Aalwaan*. One who is known by the word *Bhagavaan* is none other than the sole cause of the entire universe. The *Bhagavat shabda* is capable of denoting the complete meaning, *svaroopa, guna*, *vibhava* of *Paramaatman* who is *ananta*, all pervading. The word *Bhagavaan* is capable of denoting the complete *yaathaatmya*, complete real nature of *Parabrahman*.

Thus, the *jnyaana* by means of which the nature of *Brahman* which was so far taught is known 'as is', is told as *parajnyaana*. The other is merely *trayeemaya* - *Vedic* knowledge, or *shaastra janya jnyaana*. 



Thus, what was told as the meaning of *Bhagavat shabda* as *bhootayonitva* \(cause of all beings\) and others, that Brahman's tattva or *Svaroopa* is known by means of which *jnyaana* 'as is' \(directly perceived\), that *jnyaana* which leads to vivid perception of the Lord, is *Parajnyaana*. The other which is indirectly the means is told as *aparajnyaana*. 



The meanings of *Paravidyaa* and *Aparavidyaa* are concluded here.

*Bhagavat shabda* is used in the primary sense in the entire universe, only for denoting *Paramaatman*, who is the cause of this entire universe. In other places, it is only in the secondary sense, as told here, with respect to a *mukta*. For a *mukta*, the bondage of karma is destroyed. So *mukta* is not known by *deva*, *manushya*, and He is *ashabda gochara*. He is not denoted by the words *deva*, *manushya*, etc. The liberated self attains similarity to *Brahman* in *moksha*, and that is why he is told as *Brahma* itself, that he is similar to *Brahman*, he will have  [[86]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Brahma gunaas*. He is told in *poojyaartha*, in the secondary sense. This *shloka* does not explain the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan* can be known very clearly. *Bhagavaan* is told only with respect to *Paramaatman* in the primary sense. When it is used in the sense of respect, *Poojyaartha*, it is applicable to others, in the secondary sense, as used for *mukta* here.

He is the cause of all the causes in this universe. He is opposed to anything that is defiling. He has all the *aishwarya* so told as *mahaavibhooti*. For *Parabrahman*, the cause of everything who is without any blemish, the *Bhagavat shabda* is used in the primary sense.

Now, the *Bhagavat shabda nirvachana* is going to be done - *bha, ga*, the letters are going to be explained. To establish the *Bhagavat shabda* clearly that this  [[87]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 applies only to *Parabrahman* in the primary sense, the derivation of the word *Bhagavaan* and the meanings of each letter are explained very clearly here now. *Sambharana* is making the *prakruti* capable of modifying into its various effects. *Prakruti* becomes *mahat, ahamkaara*, etc. by mere willing of the *Paramaatman*. *Paramaatman* makes some part of *prakruti* into *sattva, rajas, tamas*, into imbalance. *Bhartaa* means *swami*, the Lord of everything. 



*Bhakaara* has two meanings - *sambhartaa* and *bhartaa*. Neta means one who protects, *goptaa. Sambhartaa* means that He makes everything go and reach Him. In dissolution, He does *samhaara*, He takes back everything so that everything comes and merges unto Him, as though it is one. He is the one who makes everything come and merge into Him, so that there is no name and form differentiation. 



*Gakaara* is both *gupti artha* and *gati artha*. Even *jnyaana artha* can be told. In this sense, He willed that to become many, and created everything. He Himself became everything. The *Ekaayana Shruti* is told here - *Bha* has two meanings - *bhartaa* and *sambhartaa*. One who has all these qualities is only *Bhagavaan*, and He is only none other than *Parambrahma, Sriman Naaraayana*. The *Atharva* *shiras pramaana* is also told here. 



All these clearly establish the meaning of *Bhagavaan* as the meanings of the letters *bha, ga*.

The meaning of *'bhaga'* in *Bhagavaan* is also told like this. He is everywhere. The word *samagra* is to be added everywhere. *Samagrasya aishwaryasya, **samagrasya veeryasya, samagrasya yashasah, samagra shriyah*. The six qualities are told for *Bhagavaan - aishwarya, veerya, yashas, shree, jnyaana, vairaagya*. All these six qualities put together is called as *Bhaga*. One who has this *Bhaga* is *Bhagavaan*.

The meaning of *'va'* is told in this *shloka. Bhootaatmani* means one who has all the beings as His *shareera*. All beings reside in Him, who has everything as His *shareera*. One who is the inner self of everything, in Him, all the beings reside, supported by Him. He is *jagat aadhaara*. He is the support of the whole world. Everything is residing in Him. He lives in all the beings as *antaraatman*, as the inner self, as He has done *anupravesha*. Everything has Him as its self. All these have *Paramaatman* as their inner self, and that is what is true. The meaning of *vakaara* is told here.

The great word - the wonderful word, *Bhagavaan*, told here, denotes none other than *Parabrahma bhoota, Vaasudeva*. It cannot denote anyone else. By the meaning of the word *Bhagavaan*, we can know that He is none other than *Vaasudeva*. This is also the *nirvachana* of *Vaasudeva*, that He *sarvatra vasati*, He lives everywhere. So, *Bhagavat shabda* denotes none other than *Vaasudeva*.

Though it is used in *poojya artha* in the *loka*, in *Nighantu*, and others, where others are also told as *Bhagavaan Baadaraayana*, etc., even there it denotes *Paramaatman* only, *Bhagavaan Naaraayana*, *Vishnu* only, in the primary sense. With respect to *Bhagavaan* in the primary sense, and in other places in the secondary sense. He is the *sarva kaarana*, He is *sarva guna paripoorna*, He is *parama poojya*. So, denoting Him is not in *upachaara*. With respect to any other *jeevaatman*, if it is told, it is only to highlight some quality which is a very minutest part of the *Paramaatman*, it is only *oupachaarika, amukhya*, in the secondary sense. In other places, if the *Bhagavaan shabda* is told, it is only that they have some special knowledge, compared to others.

The *shaadgunya* of *Bhagavaan - jnyaana, shakti, bala, aishwarya, veerya, tejas*. All other *gunaas* are *antarbhoota*, included in this itself, like *satyakaamatva*, *satyasankalpatva*; they are all *vistaara* of these qualities themselves. *Sattva* and other *gunaas* which are opposed, *vyatireka visheshanaas*, here the *nakaara* *vaachyakatva* is told. The *gunaas* of *prakruti, sattva, rajas, tamas* are not there in *Bhagavaan*; their effects such as *klesha, karma*, are included here. *Jnyaana*, *shakti, bala, aishwarya, veerya, tejas*, are those included in *sakala kalyaana* *gunaakaratva*. He is *nikhila heya pratyaneeka* is indicated by *na kaara* in word *Bhagavaan*. These are *ubhaya linga* of *Paramaatman*. This is the meaning of *Bhagavat shabda*, is what we have to do *anusandhaana* for. The *Bhagavat shabda* was explained as told in the *dvaadashaakshara*, which is an *anga* to *upaasanaa*, when one does meditation reciting that *mantra*, the *nirukti* of that *Bhagavat* *shabda* is explained thus. The meaning of *pranava* was told earlier, where the division into *Veda shaakhaas* by *Vyaasa* was told. 



*Jnyaana, shakti, bala, aishwarya, veerya, tejas* - the *shaadgunya* of *Bhagavaan* is being told here. All other *kalyaana gunaas* like *satyakaamatva, satyasankalpatva*, *sarvajnyatva*, are all included here. That which applies to Him, the other qualities, attributes of *Bhagavaan*, are all included in all these, they are all the *vistaaraas* of these *gunaas* only. All the *heya gunaas*, the *praakruta gunaas* of *sattva, rajas*, *tamas*, the letter *na* indicates that He does not have any of the *heya gunaas*. The other *gunaas* are the expansion of the different modes of these qualities only. *Na* *kaara* indicates *akhila heya pratyaneekatva*. The *trigunaas, sattva, rajas, tamas*, and the effects of these like *klesha*, are not there. It is very clear that the *ubhaya* *linga* of *Bhagavaan*, which is told as *akhilaheyapratyaneekatva* and *sakala* *kalyaana gunaakaratva*, we have to *anusandhaana* of these in the name *Bhagavaan*. Thus the *dvaadashaakshara*, the *Vaasudeva dvaadashaaksharee*, the *Bhagavat shabda* is told with this mantra. The *dvaadashaakshara* is the means to attain *Bhagavaan* as an accessory to *Brahma vidyaa*. The meaning of the *Bhagavat shabda* in this *Vaasudeva dvaadashaakshara mantra* is explained thus. 



With this, the *nirvachana* of *Bhagavat shabda* is concluded. 



We are studying Chapter 5 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is telling about the *Paramaatma svaroopa*, and the *nirvachana* of *Bhagavat shabda*. The word *Bhagavaan* is used in the primary sense with respect to only *Vishnu*, and wherever it is used with respect to others, it is only *oupachaarika*, in the *poojya*  [[91]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *artha*. Even in *poojya artha*, in the primary sense it has to be *Bhagavaan* only. Whereas for others, it is only *oupachaarika*. 



Another meaning of *Bhagavaan* is One who knows the creation, sustenance, and dissolution, which is happening for all the beings - where they come from, where they go to, One who knows all these things, and *vidyaa, avidyaa*, He only can be told as *Bhagavaan*. Only *Vishnu*, being the *Jagadekakaarana*. *Shruti* also tells very clearly in the *Naasadeeya Sookta*. If anyone knows, it will be only *Vishnu*. Nobody else knows. 



Now, *Bhagavaan's guna paripoornatva, shaadgunya, akhilaheyapratyaneekatva*, is being told.

The name *Vaasudeva* indicates that all the beings reside in Him, and He also resides in all the beings as *antaryaami*. He is the support, and they are all supported by Him. Everything is *shareera bhoota* to Him. This is told as the *nirvachana* of the *Vaasudeva shabda. Bhootaas* means the *jeevaas*. In the *Udyoga* *parvan* of *Mahaabhaarata*, it is said that He has all the *aishvarya*, and this is how He is to be known. He is the *jyoti svaroopa*, and is also the cause of creation, as told in *Mokshadharma*. There are two meanings given here - one is that He is *jyoti* *svaroopa*, and the other that He is the cause of creation. *Divu kreedaayaam*, says that *srushti*, etc. are His *kreedaa* only. In the *Ekaayana smruti* also it is told like this. *Vaasuscha asou devashcha* is *Vaasudeva*.

He lives in all the beings as the *antaryaami*, this is also told in the *Antaryaami* *Braahmana*. All the beings are supported by Him only. They reside in Him, they cannot exist independently. Their *svaroopa* cannot exist without Paramaatman. They are ever associated with Him, through *apruthaksiddhi sambandha*. He is the one who creates, and He is the Lord of all the worlds. This is the meaning of deva.

These *shlokaas* are very well known. These are also commented upon by *Bhaashyakaarar* in *Sribhaashya* and other works. What was explained so far is the meaning of the *dvaadashaakshara*, and in this the *Bhagavat shabda*. The *nirvachana* of this was told so far. For the two *vidyaas - Paraa vidyaa* and *Aparaa* *vidyaa*, this is the *vishaya* for both. The meanings told here is such that it remains firmly in our mind. This is only explained further by four *shlokaas*. He is *avyakta*, the *moola prakruti, moola kaarana*. The effects of this moola *prakruti*, are *mahat*, *ahamkaara. Gunaas*, qualities of *prakruti* are *sattva, rajas, tamas*. Aadi means *dukha, ajnyaana*, etc. which are the effect of *prakruti*. He is beyond all that, different and distinct from all that, beyond all that. For *baddha jeevaas, prakruti* *sambandha* comes because of the *karmaas*, in order or experience the fruits of *punya* and *paapa karmaas*, they get associated with *prakruti*. This is not there for *Bhagavaan*, He is the *karmaadhyaksha*. It is clear that *Bhagavaan* is different and distinct from the matter, and also the *jeevaatman* who is associated with this matter. 



In *samsaara dashaa, mukta* was once upon a time a bound self only, then he got liberated and became a *mukta*. At that time, when he was in *samsaara*, he was covered by *avidyaa*, etc., so he had *jnyaana sankocha*. This makes *Bhagavaan* different and distinct from a *mukta*. There is no *jnyaana sankocha* for *Bhagavaan* at any time at all. He is inner self of all, and is different and distinct from *nitya* also. He is the one who controls everything. 



Even *nityaas*, though they are never associated with *samsaara* at any time, they are supported and reside in *Paramaatman* only. They are controlled by *Paramaatman*, and are also *shareera* of *Paramaatman*. They are *nityaas* because of *Bhagavaan's sankalpa* only. 



He is pervading inside and outside, all over. This is told as *aattam*. That which is inside the *prakruti mandala*, all the objects, are all pervaded by *Bhagavaan*, inside and outside, completely.

He has all the divine auspicious qualities. This is His nature itself. By the minutest part of His *sankalpa* itself, He has pervaded everything. He is supporting them, He is doing the *dhaarana*, by the very minute part of His *sankalpa*. He is pervading all the beings inside and outside, by the minutest part of His *shakti*. All His *avataaraas*, whatever body He takes, are taken by His own will. It is suitable to Him. He takes such a body. His *deha* is *poojya*, most worshippable, divine auspicious form. During His *avataara*, He takes by His own will. His *avataaraas* are most beneficial to the world. By His *avataaraas*, He also shows what is the form of the Lord to be meditated upon, otherwise we will never come to know about how to meditate the Lord. For this, He has to come Himself and reveal Himself. He reveals as *Vibhavaavataara, Archaavataara*, so that we know the form of the *Bhagavaan* to meditate upon. He reveals His form for us to do *aaraadhanaa*, *poojaa*, etc., for doing *jagat hita*, for doing good to the whole world. Out of His own will He takes *avataara*. Whatever He wants to accomplish in those *avataaraas*, whatever is good to the world, He takes that form.

He is the *raashi*, He has got innumerable *ananta kalyaana gunaas, shaadgunya* and other *kalyaana gunaas, teja, bala, aishwarya, jnyaana, veerya, shakti*, He is an abode to only innumerable auspicious *kalyaana gunaas*. It is told clearly what is not there, the meaning of the *nakaara, klesha, \(avidyaa, asmita*, etc.\), *karma*, *vipaaka, aashaya \(vaasanaa\),* which are told in the *Yoga sootraas* are not there in Him. He is away from any defect. It is not that He had some defect and it got removed, but His nature is totally opposed to anything which is defiling. Just like light and darkness. Light cannot tolerate any darkness. He does not have any of the *heya gunaas*. He is *paraanaam parah*. Even *Brahma* and other gods, He is Supreme to them also. He is the ruler of *para* and *avara*, the *devaas* and *manushyaas*. He is the Lord of both.

He is the Lord of all, *Eeshvara*, the Supreme Ruler. He has these forms - *Vyooha*, *Vibhava*. His *Vaasudeva para roopa* is *avyakta*, cannot be seen - this is *avyakta*. The *Vibhava*, and Archaa roopa are all seen here - these are *vyakta*. These can be told as *Vyashti* \(differentiated\), *Samashti* \(collective\) *roopa*. *Para roopa* is *avyakta*. The *Vyooha* and other forms are revealed. He is *avyakta svaroopa* and *prakata svaroopa* also. With all these, in any form, He is *sarveshvara* only, Supreme Lord. He does not have anyone who is superior to Him. He is not under the control of anyone else. He has *sarvajnyatva*, He sees everything. *Sri* *Aalavandaar* says " *yugapat sarvam pratyakshena sadaa svatah*", as told by *Sri* *Naathamuni* himself. *Sarvajnya* means that He knows everything. *Sarvavit* means that He knows the *prakaaraas* of everything. He can know directly. He does not need any *indriyaas*, and other means. He can also know through *indriyaas* if He wants. These are all *apraakruta* only for Him. Or, this is all for His benefit only. He is superior to all the powers. All *shaktis* are residing in Him.

The *para vidyaa, paraa yayaa tadaksharam abhigamyate*, which was told, is being concluded here. There is another *paatha, sa jnyaayate yena*. This *sah* means *Purushottama* only. This is told - *jnyaatum drashtum cha tattvena praveshtum cha **parantap* a, as told in the *Bhagavad Geeta*. Three things are told here - *Parabhakti*, *Parajnyaana, Paramabhakti. Bhagavatpraapti* only is the cure for *taapatrayaas*. Only then, one can attain moksha, eternal communion with *Bhagavaan*. First comes *jnyaana, aagamottha jnyaana, vaakya janya jnyaana, **shruti, shaastra janya jnyaana*, He is known through this. Through *upaasanaa*, *darshana samaanaakaaratva*, He is attained, He is seen. The *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan* is told, *ubhaya lingatva*, He has no defects, etc. He is known through *vivekaja jnyaana, upaasanaatmaka jnyaana*. He is attained through *darshana* *samaanaakaara, bhakti roopaapanna, upaasanaa, dhruvaa anusmruti, **tailadhaaraavat avicchinna smruti santati roopaa*, and then only can one attain *Bhagavaan*. The *phala* also will be similar to that. All of this is told as *jnyaana*. From *shaastra janya jnyaana*, *tattva jnyaana* comes, then through *vivekaja* *jnaana*, one can see; when this becomes *darshana samaanaakaara*, and *bhakti* *roopaapanna* also, then *Bhagavaan* is attained. This is actually *jnyaana*, the real knowledge. Everything else other than that is said to be *ajnyaana* with respect to that. Anything other than *Bhagavat vishaya*, that which is opposed to *Bhagavaan*, is all *bandhaka, avidyaa roopa*. That which gets *svaroopa vikaara* itself, the *achit*, He is different and distinct from that. He is different and distinct from *prakruti* *samsrushta chetana, baddha chetana*. He is always *shuddha*, not like *muktaas*, who were at one time associated with *prakruti*, and were *ashuddha. Bhagavaan* is different and distinct from *muktaas*, this is shown by *nirmala. Ekaroopam* shows that He is different and distinct from *nitya sooris* also; based on *Bhagavaan's* *sankalpa*, they can take many forms. Where is this told, means that this is told in the *Shrutis*. It is told in the *Shrutis* that there is no other way. We have to do *upaasanaa* on Him, it has to be *darshana samaanaakaara roopaapanna*. 



Whatever *Keshidhvaja* taught to *Khaandikya Janaka*, that *Sri Paraasharar* is telling here, the *Bhagavat svaroopa*. 



This completes Chapter Five.
