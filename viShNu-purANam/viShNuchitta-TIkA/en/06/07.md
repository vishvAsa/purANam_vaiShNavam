*Keshidhvaja* - O *Khaandikya Janaka*. Why did you not ask for my kingdom? I don't think there is anything more dear for a *Kshatriya* than ruling over a kingdom. All the *Kshatriyaas* always want to rule over a kingdom. How come you did not ask me that? 



*Keshidhvaja* is actually testing *Khaandikya Janaka* whether he has really felt grief in this *samsaara*, and really has *nirveda*. A *Kshatriya* can do *prajaa paalana*, can look after his *prajaas*, by ruling over a kingdom only. As a *Kshatriya*, it is your duty to look after your *prajaas*. And you need to rule over a kingdom for that. If you neglect that, it will be a defect on your part. So, he said - "Why are you not asking me for the kingdom?"

*Pandita* means - *panda* means knowledge of what is right and what is wrong. One who has this *viveka*, the mind which can distinguish between what is right and what is wrong, is a *pandita*.

When I am weak and not capable of protecting my country, as I lost to you, and you have taken over my kingdom, and because of that, if I am not looking after my *prajaas*, that is not a *dosha* for me. I have lost the kingdom to you. I do not have the *adhikaara* to rule over now. So, there is no dosha there. When *adhikaara* is there for someone, even then, if they leave the kingdom and do not look after the *prajaas*, then it will be a defect on the part of the king. Whereas I do not have the *adhikaara*. That is why there is no dosha for me.

When others have got all the defects, it is all because of their desire and other things which are not correct. Because of the defects of that nature, they desire to rule over a kingdom. That is not a proper *dharma*. It will only lead to very meagre enjoyment of *bhogaas*. I am not like that. For me, it is not *dharma*. It is only with the desire to enjoy all the things here, which are very meagre, and it will not be dharma for me.

What *Keshidhvaja* wanted to test was - in order to rule over the *prajaas*, you have to request for a kingdom, you have to do *yaachanaa*, you have to beg. I am not supposed to beg. Superior *Kshatriyaas* do not beg, even if they want to rule over a kingdom. I will not beg. A *shreshtha Kshatriya* thinks that one should not beg for a kingdom. Ruling over this kingdom, and all of that, I did not ask you.

What was told earlier, that those who do not have the *viveka* go and run after a kingdom, they are always after possession, wanting more and more. This is not correct, they are all *avivekis*. They are not wise. They are as though intoxicated with the drink of *ahamkaara*, and I am not like that.

*Keshidhvaja* - In order to do my *varnaashrama dharma*, to get rid of this *praarabdha karma* which is obstructing the *upaasanaa*, I do various *yaagaas*, and rule over my kingdom. So, this is my *varna dharma*. With all this, I will get rid of my *praarabdha karma*, and my *paapa, punya*, and everything. Whatever punya I have accumulated, that has to be experienced also, all the *bhogaas*, enjoyments have to be done without any attachment; then that will also get exhausted. I am doing that. 



In this *shloka*, in order to tell the *yoga svaroopa*, and what is necessary as a part of that *yoga svaroopa*, in order to do *upaasanaa, bhakti yoga*, one has to know the *aatma svaroopa jnyaana, aatma saakshaatkaara* is also required, one should know the difference and distinction between *prakruti* and *aatma, purusha*, and then have *aatma saakshaatkaara*, and then go and do *bhakti yoga*. Shruti tells about *aatma saakshaatkaara. Avidyayaa mrutyum teertvaa vidyayaa amrutam **ashnute* is told in *Eeshaavaasya Upanishad*. By performing the *varnaashrama* *vihita karma*, the *praarabdha karma* which is obstructing the start of *upaasanaa*, one can get rid of that, and then *upaasanaa* can be started. So, one has to perform *varnaashrama dharma* properly.

You are fortunate that your mind is now getting this *viveka*, of what is right and wrong. You did not desire for the kingdom, but are asking me to teach this *adhyaatma vijnyaana*, so you are a *viveki*. You know how to differentiate between what is right and wrong. You are very fortunate to have such a mind. Listen to me about the *svaroopa* of *avidyaa*, I am going to teach you now. *Avidyaa* means the *varnaashrama dharma*, which I am going to teach you its nature.

This is a very important shloka which says what are the two main causes for *samsaara*. These are the two causes for the seeds for the tree of *samsaara*. In order for the tree of *samsaara* to grow, these two are like the seeds for that. \(1\) That which is not *aatma*, thinking that it is *aatma. Deha* is not *aatma*, it is *anaatma*, thinking that *deha* is *aatma*, this is *dehaatma bhramaa*. \(2\) That which is required to nurture and grow the body, that is what is required for me, if one thinks like that, they will only look after their body, and not their *aatma*. Thinking that it belongs to me. *Kaamya karmaas* which are having some fruits, for the enjoyment of the individual self, performing those, they get impermanent fruits, and benefits which will not last long. This will only make one to be more and more in *samsaara* only. This is the cause of the tree of *samsaara*.

*Ahamkaara* and *mamakaara*, thinking that what is not mine is mine, all the things needed to look after the body, thinking that they are all belonging to me, near to me. This body which is made of *pancha bhootaas*, this body belongs to me, it is mine, he thinks wrongly. 



Four *shlokaas* explain this *ahamkaara* and *mamakaara*. This *dehi*, who is the *aatman*, this individual self, thinks that this *panchabhootaatmaka shareera*, body made up of five elements, thinks that the body is mine, that I am the body. He has the idea that he is the *aatman*, in the body, the *dehaatma bhramaa*. He thinks that the land and other things, that they all belong to him, that he is the owner, that he owns this, and this is all mine. He is covered by *poorva karma vaasanaa*, the impressions which have come from earlier births.

Who can even think that the *aatman* which is different from the *kalebara*, body; how can he think that the body itself is the *aatman? Aatman* is not the *deha*.

House, land and other things, are enjoyed by the body only. Because he is endowed with this body, this *panchabhootaatmaka deha*, and it is not in *aatma* *svaroopa*. These kind of enjoyments are not there in *aatma svaroopa*. In this *aatma*, which is not the body, how can he even think that this is mine. House, land, are for the purpose of enjoyment of the body only, not the *aatman*. In *aatma svaroopa*, these are all not there. He thinks that these are all mine, which are all connected only because of this body. In this *samsaara*, he is born as a  [[118]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 human or deva, and gets different enjoyments because of all these births. They are all because of the body with which he is associated. Thinking that the body itself is the *aatman*, and thinking that all these house and land which do not belong to him, which are not connected with the *aatman*, as *aatma svaroopa* is *parishuddha* and these are not connected, as belonging to him - no wise person will think like that.

*Kalebara*, body is different from the *aatman*. The son, grandson, and others, who are all born of the body only, how can a knowledgeable, wise person think that these are all mine? All these are related only to the body, the *sambandha* is *shareera sambandha*, it is not *aatma sambandha*. The relationship of son, grandson, are not there in the *aatma svaroopa*; they are all because of the body, which is associated with *prakruti*. How can someone think that he is the owner of this, the master of this, that this thing belongs to him, etc., when the body is different from the *aatman*?

Because of the twofold ignorance, thinking of what is not belonging to him as belonging to him, that he is the master, owner of all that, when it is not really so, and thinking of the body as the *aatman*, when they are very different from each other, will only bind him more and more into *samsaara*. Because of this, if he does all acts only for the enjoyment of the body, he will be bound in the *samsaara* only. Because of these two kinds of misconceptions, wrong understandings, if he does all the *karmaas* only for the enjoyment of the body, that will only bind him more and more. All acts he does only for the enjoyment of the body. It will be  [[119]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 again, for bandha, for giving birth to more bodies only. He will have more children, grandchildren, etc. which will put him more and more into *samsaara*.

Mixing water and mud, the house is smeared and made of mud only. Similarly, this body is also *paarthiva*, a modification of *pruthivi* only, and it is also made of mud and water. Here, out of five, only *pruthivi* is told here, there are different opinions like that. After *pancheekarana, pruthivi* itself has all the five elements in different proportions.

All the enjoyments are also *panchabhootaatmaka* only, the food that we eat, and others are all *shabda sparsha roopa rasa gandha* - all our enjoyments through the senses are all *panchabhootaatmaka* only. And the body is also *panchabhootaatmaka*. The body which is made of five elements is pleased with the objects of the senses which are also *panchabhootaatmaka*. What is this enjoyment for the *aatman* who is there, who is very different and distinct from the *panchabhootaatmaka* body?

This is also an often quoted *shloka*. Thousands and thousands of births are coming in this path of *samsaara*, the cycle of births and deaths and births and deaths. He is extremely tired, and there is *moha*, because of the ignorance and wrong understanding, and all the delusion. He has the *vaasanaas*, the reminiscent impressions, from birth to birth to birth, where he is repeatedly doing some actions, and engaging in worldly enjoyments, related to body and senses, and  [[120]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 because of that, he has developed these *vaasanaas*, impressions, continuing from birth to birth. He is suffering great grief because of his ignorance. 



An individual self has taken thousands of births, and he is treading the path of *samsaara*, and he has got tremendous amount of grief, because of the ignorance, which is *mohashrama*, and because of the *vaasanaas*, which is *ajnyaana* *karma* *ubhaya vaasanaa*, which is ignorance, and *karma*, the reminiscent impressions getting passed on from birth to birth. And this is causing him all the grief and suffering. He has been suffering for innumerable births like this. 



This further continues, and there is description of *aatma svaroopa, yoga*. Which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the *adhyaatma jnyaana* that he has to *Khaandikya Janaka*. This starts with the teaching of the nature of the individual self, and the body, this *tattva jnyaana*, and then he goes on to teach the nature of the means, the *yoga*.

When this ignorance is destroyed, when the grief is destroyed by proper knowledge, *tattva jnyaana*, the ignorance is dispelled, then he will be experiencing his real nature, he will get the *aatma svaroopa jnyaana*, which is incomparable, and there is nothing which can exceed this. This is the supreme  [[121]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 bliss he will experience. There is no grief at all there. He will experience the joy of supreme bliss. When he gets the proper knowledge, his ignorance is dispelled.

The nature of the self is told here. This is the nature of bliss. The nature of the individual self is pure consciousness. He is without any defect. Grief and ignorance, these are qualities of *prakruti*, are all belonging to matter, in association with matter; this is not in the real nature of the individual self; is because of the association with matter that he is getting this. 



The fruits of various acts, *karmaas* which we do, are all due to the karma, whereas the *aatma svaroopa*, is always *aananda* only. The nature of *aatman* is bliss and pure consciousness, without any defect. It is like this - there is a gem which is covered with dust, and it is not shining, we don't see a shine as it is covered with a lot of dust; if the gemstone is cleaned, and the dust is removed, it shines forth with its natural radiance; this radiance is not created newly, but it is just covered with dust; that radiance always existed in the gem; when the dust is removed, the gem shines in its original state of radiance. In the same way, the individual self, who is of the nature of supreme bliss and consciousness, *jnyaana* and *aananda*, and whose attributive consciousness, *dharma bhoota jnyaana* which is always infinite, is covered and contracted because of the association with matter; these have come because of the *karmaas* that he has been doing forever. He has to experience the fruits of that. When he attains liberation, the veil of karma is removed, and then he will be in his natural state. His knowledge is not newly created, but he will be in his natural state. He is the knower, and his  [[122]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 knowership is never lost. His *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is always infinite, but it is covered and contracted because of association with *prakruti*. When he attains liberation, he goes and reaches *Parabrahman*, in *Paramapada, Vaikuntha*, and his original form will be coming into force at that time. This is not newly created, it always existed, and now the veil of *karma* is removed. His *dharma bhoota **jnyaana* is always associated with him inseparably, and this is eternal. Just as the *aatma svaroopa* is *nitya*, his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is also *nitya*. The logicians, and the *naiyaayikaas* say that the *jnyaana* is not *nitya*, that it comes and goes, that we acquire new knowledge, and we forget it; but this kind of argument is against the *Shrutis*, the *Vedaas. Ajnyaana* and *dukha*, ignorance and grief are not experienced by matter as matter does not have knowership, as it is *achetana*, not having *jnyaana*. Because of the association with matter, he experiences grief, and it is not in his original state because the association with matter is coming in order to experience the fruits of karma, which he has been doing forever. When did the karma start, it is *anaadi*, beginningless; because of this, he has been accumulating *punya* and *paapa*, and then to experience the results of *punya* and *paapa*, he has to take different births, and so he is taking births again and again. But, in his real nature, there is no grief; in his nature, there is only bliss, *sukha*, and *jnyaana*. As he is experiencing the grief and ignorance due to association with *prakruti*, these are said to be the qualities of *prakruti* itself. The body cannot experience *sukha*, as it is *achetana*, it does not have knowledge. It is told in *Bhagavad Geeta* that he is associated with prakruti, and he experiences *sukha, dukha*. If it is taken that *prakruti* itself is experiencing these, then it is against the *pramaanaas. Prakruti* does not experience as it does not have knowership.

There is an example given here. When water is put in a pot and then heated, because of being there in the pot and getting heated, the association with the heat, it starts to boil and make noise. These are all not the natural qualities of water. This is all happening because of its association with heat, and coming in contact with heat, being inside the pot, which gets heated; because of this, the  [[123]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 water gets heated, and because of this, it is having these qualities. The original quality of water is being cold, *sheeta*; it does not have bubbles, and does not make noise, having bubbles and making noise are not the natural qualities of water. In the same way, the *aatman*, in its essential nature is without any defect, and is *jnyaana aananda svaroopa*. By the association with matter, *aatma*, the individual self starts to think that this body itself is the self, and starts to experience grief. Just as water is coming in contact with fire, and it is inside the pot, in a similar way, *prakruti* is associated with *jeevaatman*, and the *jeevaatman* experiences *aadhyaatmika, aadhibhoutika, aadhidaivika taapaas*. Because of the association with matter, he gets all these *taapaas*, and he thinks that these are all in his original nature, whereas they are not in his real nature. His real nature is pure *jnyaana* and *aananda svaroopa*, and he does not have any defects like grief.

Like this, I have told you the nature of *avidyaa*. I have told you the root cause of *avidyaa*. The means to getting rid of *klesha, karma*, is *yoga*, and there is nothing else. *Khaandikya Janaka* had asked a question - what is the means to get rid of all these difficulties, grief, *karma*. The answer is that *yoga* only is the answer to this. *Yoga* means the meditation upon the *Paramaatman*.

*Keshidhvaja* - O *Khaandikya*, do listen to me, I am going to explain to you the nature of *yoga*. One who is practicing *yoga*, will attain unity with *Paramaatman*, and he will never fall back from that, he will never come into this *samsaara* again. 



*Brahma laya* does not mean merging into *Brahman*. This does not mean losing one's identity. There will be two substances only - *jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman*. *Jeevaatman* will not get destroyed. It will be *Brahmabhaava* - *jeevaatman* will get similar characteristics as *Brahman*. His *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will be exactly same as *Parabrahman*. Even in *Karma kaanda*, the various *karmaas* are told; when they perform the *karmaas* and worship *Indra* and other *devataas*, it is said that they go and merge with those *devaas*; this is not so; they go and attain their worlds and enjoy there. Or also as *Prahlaada's* experience, where he thought of himself as *Achyuta*, he had that experience; he experienced the *Parabrahman* who was the inner self of himself, this he addressed as *'Aham' *, the *deha vishishta **aatma vishishta Paramaatman*, the *Paramaatman* who is *aatman* to him. This kind of experience is also meant here.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 For *manushyaas*, humans, mind only is the cause of getting bound in the *samsaara*, as well as getting liberated. With the same mind, one can get attached to everything here and stay in *samsaara*, or, one can practice *yoga* and get liberated. When one is attached to the sense objects, then he will always be bound in *samsaara*. When he takes away his mind from the sense objects, when he controls the sense objects and does not go under their sway, he can get liberated. From these *shlokaas, Keshidhvaja* is going to explain the nature of *yoga*, and the causes, *angaas* or accessories, the *vishaya* or object, and *phala* or fruit.

One has to withdraw the mind from the sense objects. And concentrate it on the individual self. And then, he has to meditate upon the *Parabrahman* for liberation. He has to attain the distinctive knowledge among *prakruti, purusha* and *Eeshvara*, the nature of individual self, matter and *Paramaatman*, about how they are different and distinct from each other. Then he has to meditate in his mind, and the object of meditation should be *Parameshvara*.

Here, the *phala* is going to be told, the fruit of such a *yoga*. One who meditates upon *Parabrahman* like this, he can realize the self. *Vikaaryatva* is *aatyantika **laya*, which is complete destruction, that he will totally get destroyed; he is currently in the state of *anaadi avidyaa* and *karma* which is coming from beginningless time, and the *vaasanaas* which are coming from birth to birth, and  [[126]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 the various bodies that he is taking, being bound in all of avidyaa, karma, *vaasanaa, deha*, since beginningless time; such an individual self, with the knowledge of *Bhagavaan*, when he meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, that state will be destroyed; and he will not have any of *avidyaa, karma, vaasanaa, deha*; and all the experiences, feelings, emotions, which are due to association with matter will be destroyed; this is called *aatyantika laya*; where all the *karmaas* will get destroyed totally, and he will be freed; and this is *vikaaryatva*.

The nature of this kind of *aatma*, one has to meditate upon, then he will attain the *Brahmabhaava*. The *bhaavaas* of *aatma* are told here - *apahatapaapmaa*, *vijaro, vimrutyu, vishoka, vijighatsa, apipaasa, satyakaama, satyasankalpa*, these are the *svabhaava* of *aatma*. When he gets moksha, when he gets liberated in *Paramapada*, he gets all kinds of enjoyment. Here *Baadaraayanar* quotes the *pramaana* of *Jaimini Rishi*, who says that *jeevaatman* attains the nature of *Brahman* when he gets liberated, that his *dharmabhoota jnyaana* becomes equal to *Brahman*, and he also gets the *apahatapaapmaatvaadi ashta gunaas*. The opinion of *Jaimini* is told by *Baadaraayanar* in this *Brahma Sutra*. What is established in this *Brahma Sutra* is that he will get infinite bliss.

The example of magnet is given here. A magnet when it attracts the iron, the iron also gets magnetized there. It attracts, when it moves, the iron also will move, when it rotates, that also rotates. Similarly, he will get the nature of *Parabrahman*. He can take any form, and move around in any worlds, a liberated one. The *Shrutis* for that are told here, that he attains *Brahmabhaava*.

Instead of magnet, *aakarshaka*, that which attracts, *Agni*, fire is also told. Because it attracts, and removes all the defects of whatever comes into contact with it. When gold comes in contact with fire, all the defects of the gold are removed by the fire. In the same way, when one meditates upon *Brahman*, mind gets rid of all the defects and becomes pure.

When a huge bundle of cotton is thrown into a fire, it gets completely destroyed. In the same way, in a liberated one, the *karma, vaasanaas*, and all defects, *paapaas* are destroyed completely. All these *pramaanaas* are giving similarity of *Paramaatman* with *Agni*. Gold also becomes like fire as it shines, burns like fire, when it comes in contact with fire; when all its impurities are removed, it shines like fire. When gold is impure, it will not shine forth. When it is put into fire, all the impurities are removed, and it shines forth like anything, and fire causes the gold to shine forth similar to itself. In the same way, when we think about *Parabrahman*, when a *yogi* meditates upon *Parabrahman*, his mind becomes pure and he gets liberated, and all his sins are destroyed completely, his *punya* and *paapa* and everything. And he attains *Brahmabhaava. Paramaatman* makes him to attain a nature similar to him with respect to his attributive consciousness.

In these three-four *shlokaas*, the nature of *yoga*, the object of meditation, the fruit are all told. Now, is told in detail the nature of *yoga*, till the end of this chapter. From beginningless time, the self is always associated with matter, and always after experience of the sense objects. The impressions are continuing from birth to birth forever. And it is very difficult to attain *Paramaatman*. One has to put a lot of effort to attain him. That requires the *aatma prayatna*, the efforts of the individual self, because the individual self is always associated with *karma*, *vaasanaa*, etc. That meditation which is constant, continuous, and without any break, when it is done, leads to vivid perception of the Lord. It is of the nature of unparalleled bliss. Whatever are the stored defects of the mind, that mind has to be associated with *Brahman*, should be focussed on Brahman. This is called *yoga*. There is another thought, where the meaning of *yoga* is *laya*, where *aatma* and *Paramaatman* become one; there will be no two objects, only one will exist; this thought is refuted here, not accepted here. Because *yoga* is told as meditating upon the *divya mangala vigraha* of *Brahman*, which will be told later. One substance cannot become another substance. When the two are merged, the nature of both will remain as it is. One cannot lose its identity completely, there is no *svaroopa naasha*. So, *laya* is not accepted here.

Whatever was explained, with all the attributes, with associated accessories, etc., that kind of *yoga* which is the *dharma*, one who has all this kind of *yoga*, who is practicing this, is said to be a *mumukshu, moksham icchuh mumukshuh*, one who is desirous of attaining liberation. The means to attain *moksha* is *yoga*. And that is a form of *dharma*. It is a *dharma* means that it has to be practiced, to be put into practice. Its *anusthaana* has to be done. Mere *vaakyaartha jnyaana* does not lead to *moksha*. Just a knowledge of the *Upanishadic* sentences will not give *moksha*.  [[129]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 One has to learn that, and has to meditate upon what is told in the *Upanishads*. The first step is understanding the Upanishadic statement, but after that, it has to be put to practice. One has to do *upaasanaa*, meditation. It is not an *avidheya* *jnyaana*, it has a *vidhi*, it is simply not *vaakyaartha jnyaana*. It is beyond *vaakyaartha jnyaana*. The other arguments are refuted here. 



It has got many special characteristics, and it is a *dharma*. It has to be practiced.

And one who has attained *samaadhi*, having passed through all the stages of *yoga*, and attained the final stage of beatitude, he will attain *Parambrahma*, he is said to be *vinishpanna samaadhi*. 



Based on the state in which a *yogi* is, the names are different. One who has started on *yoga* and is still progressing, is called *yogayuk*. One who has realized *Paramaatman*, is called *vinishpanna samaadhi. Samaadhi* comes after *dhyaana*. Up to *dhyaana*, the seven stages told - *yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, **pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa, dhyaana* - whoever is in all these stages is called a *yogayuk*.

One who is a *yogayuk*, one who has not yet attained *samaadhi*, one who is there up to the state of *dhyaana*, for him, many many births have to be taken and he has to keep on practicing yoga till all the obstructions are destroyed, and he is able to attain *dhyaana*, and can go to *samaadhi* state. Up to that, it may take many many births for him. Whereas one who has gone into the *samaadhi* state, will get liberated in one birth itself. *Antaraaya* are the various obstructions which come in the practice of yoga before attaining the perfection in yoga. Up to the state of *dhaaranaa - yama, niyama, aasana, praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, **dhaaranaa* - there are ten *antaraayaas* like *aalasya*. In *Patanjali Sutraas*, these are told as those which distract the mind from concentrations - *vyaadhi, **sthyaana, samshaya, pramaada, aalasya, avirati, bhraanti darshana, alabdha **bhoomikatva, anavasthitatva* - these are the *chitta vikshepa* causes, *antaraayaas*. They cause the meditation to be not steady. In *Patanjali Sutraas*, nine such obstructions are told. *Sri Engal Aalwaan* quotes from *Vaayu Samhita* as ten obstructions.

*Vyaadhi* is disease, sickness, ill health. *Sthyaana* is inertia, mental sluggishness. *Samshaya* is doubt, feeling of uncertainty. *Pramaada* is carelessness, acting without reflection. *Aalasya* is fatigue, laziness of the body and mind, exhaustion. *Avirati* is indulgence without stop, sensual gratification. *Bhraanti darshana* is delusion, a wandering sense of vision. *Alabdha bhoomikatva* is inability to take a new step. *Anavasthitatva* is failure to maintain progress steadily. These are told in the *Yoga Sutraas*. These are told similarly here. For the one who is practicing yoga, these are all the obstructions which come in the way.

When one is interested only in *animaa, mahimaa, pratimaa,* etc., the *siddhis*, they will be here only, as they will have special powers here. Whereas one who is only after liberation, he will not be interested in all of these. So, these *siddhis* become obstructions to one, in this way.

Brahmacharya* is not associating with women. *Aparigraha* is not possessing or accepting things which are not allowed as per *shaastra. Asteya* is not stealing. *Satya* is telling the truth. Without desiring any other fruit, one has to be devoted and performing *yoga*. And his mind will attain perfection in this way.

Whatever one possesses, not desiring for anything more is called as santosha. Focussing the mind on *Parabrahman* is also a *guna*. The mind should be always focussed on attaining *Paramaatman*, with great devotion, meditating on His *divya* *mangala vigraha*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Five *Yamas* and five *Niyamaas* are told for a *yogi*. They can give different fruits. For a *nishkaama*, he is not desirous of other fruits, but is only focussed on liberation. He gets liberated. Others desirous of *ashta siddhis*, will get special powers, siddhis. One who is interested in all that may get all of that. But, one who is not interested in all that, but totally focussed on liberation, attaining *Parabrahman*, will attain liberation.

With *Yama* and *Niyama*, whatever was told, endowed with all of this, one should practice *yoga* and meditate upon *Brahman*. 



Next, will be told about *Praanaayaama*. Which is explained in detail, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the nature of *yoga* to *Khaandikya Janaka*. In this, he told about *Yama, Niyama, Aasana*, the initial three *angaas* of *yoga*. Now, he is going to teach about *Praanaayaama* and further stages.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *vigraha*, or chanting a *mantra*, or *mantra japa* - this is *Sabeeja. Sagarbha **Praanaayaama*. Without any of these is *Abeeja*, simply doing the *Praanaayaama*.

*Rechaka, Pooraka, Kumbhaka* are the three parts of *Praanaayaama. Rechaka* is *ucchvaasa, nishvaasa, abhibhava* - where *ucchvaasa* is taking in, *nishvaasa* is leaving out, and controlling and stopping it, this is *Rechaka*. The opposite of that is *Pooraka*, is said to be of two types. The *ucchvaasa* and *nishvaasa* are told together, and they join together in *Kumbhaka*, when the breath is controlled inside. These three are again of three types, by the difference in duration, *maatraa bheda*, the number of *maatraas* during which it is done.

This is one sign that he is mastering the Praanaayaama. The second stage is *kampana*, there will be involuntary tremors in the body, and this is felt in the *madhyama*, when he practices for 24 *maatraas*. When he does for 36 *maatraas*, then it is *utthaana*, the *praana* is said to raise and reach the *Brahma* *Randhra*, this is told in *yoga*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Agarbha*. When *Japa* and *Dhyaana* are included, then it is *Sagarbha*. There are hundreds of types, with different combinations. This is about *Praanaayaama* explained in the Commentary.

The *moorta roopa* of *Bhagavaan*, the form of *Bhagavaan*, is *sabeeja*.

This is *Pratyaahaara* told here. These two *shlokaas* are telling about *Pratyaahaara*. The *indriyaas* which are always going after *shabda, sparsha, roopa*, *rasa, gandha*, the sense objects, controlling them from that, and withdrawing them is called *Pratyaahaara*. One has to withdraw all the *indriyaas*, and make his mind steady and free from all these sense objects.

Their mind will be very steady, and they will be able to control their mind from going after the sense objects. Those who are not controlling the sense organs, they cannot practice *yoga*, they will not attain any *siddhi* in *yoga*. Those who do not have control on the senses cannot practice *yoga*.

Controlling the *praana* with *Praanaayaama*, with *Pratyaahaara*, controlling the *indriyaas*, the sense organs - controlling both of these, he has to meditate upon the *Shubhaashraya* of *Paramaatman*, the *divya mangala vigraha* of *Paramaatman*. 



In the mind, the *sthoola roopa* of *Paramaatman* has to be steadily contemplated upon. This is said to be *Dhaaranaa*.

And meditating upon which one destroys all the *doshaas*, defects. Mala is the *raaga, dvesha*. *Dosha* is any other impurities of the mind. They will all be destroyed by meditating upon the *Shubhaashraya* of *Bhagavaan*.

*Keshidhvaja* - The *aashraya* for the mind, the support for the mind, the mind has to have an object to think about, one has to meditate upon an object only. Without an object, one cannot do meditation. That *aashraya* for the mind, is of two types - the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, and *para roopa* and *apara roopa*. 



Initially, the *ashubhaashraya* is told. *Shubhaashraya* is to be told, before that, first, the *ashubhaashraya* is told, those which are not *Shubhaashraya*. The *Baddha* *jeevaas, Mukta jeevaas* are all not *Shubhaashraya*, as they are either *ashubha*, or they do not have *aashraya*. Only *Bhagavaan's* form is *Shubhaashraya*. Before telling the *Bhagavaan's* form, which is *Shubhaashraya*, the *ashubhaashraya* which are not fit for meditation, are told now with *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*. These are the *Kshara* and *Akshara* told in *Bhagavad Geeta **- Ksharah sarvaani bhootaani kootastho akshara uchyate*. And *Para* and *Apara* are told. *Moorta roopa* is the *Chaturmukha Brahma* and all the bound selves, who are in the *prakruti mandala*, and are having a body; they are associated with matter, *prakruti*, and they have a *praakruta shareera*; starting from *Chaturmukha* down to all the beings in this *prakruti mandala*, the bound selves. *Amoorta* is without a *shareera*, the *mukta* *roopa*, the liberated selves. One is *Para*, and another is *Apara*. 



How can they be told as *Brahma dvidhaa*? Because they are all *Brahmaatmaka*. *Moorta roopaas* and *Amoorta roopaas* are also that of *Parabrahman* only as they all have *Brahman* only as their inner self. This *Brahmaatmaka naanaatva* is told in the *Shrutis* only. *Abrahmaatmaka naanaatva* is what is negated. *Moorta* and *Amoorta* are said to be *Brahman* only, as they are *Brahmaatmaka*. They are also forms of *Bhagavaan* only, as told in *Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma*. But can they be meditated upon, if a question arises, they are not fit for meditation. In order to tell this, this has been told by *Keshidhvaja* initially. First, he tells about the *baddha* *svaroopa*, and the *muktaas*. He says that both are not fit for meditation. And then he tells about *Bhagavat roopa*, which is *Shubhaashraya*.

It is told that the *sthaavaraas* are the last in that category - it is told as *deva*, *manushya, tiryak, sthaavara*. Even for *Himavat parvata*, some *karma adhikaara* is  [[140]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 told in the *Puraanaas. Bilva*, the trees are also said to be having some *karma* *adhikaara*, they also do some *karmaas*, there is a *chetana* in them also. That is why it is told as *avara* here.

*Adhikara* is thinking that whatever *karma* one does, is for my purpose only, and for me to gain whatever fruits I want. If one wants *svarga phala*, then this *karma* is for me to attain this *svarga phala*. Like that, if one thinks that it is for them, and for attaining whatever desires they have, and this is said to be *adhikaara*. Whoever in this *samsaara dashaa*, thinks that the *karmaas* are for fulfilling various desires for them, are meant for them, is told here. Hiranyagarbha and others have both *Brahmabhaavanaa* and *Karmabhaavanaa*. Anyone performing *karmaas* for their own purpose, they have all these *bhaavanaas*.

Whatever is there in this world, having *deva, manushyaadi aakaara*, etc., for them, till the *tattva jnyaana* is not yet arisen, and they are still engaged in *karmaas*, here the *vishesha jnyaana* is the differences existing in *deva, manushya*, and others, that only is the *aatma*, thinking that the body itself is the *aatman*,  [[141]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 getting a liking for that, and thinking that "I am only this body", and then performing all the acts according to that. When he gets into the body of a *deva*, or *manushya*, or *krimi* or *keeta*, they get *abhimaana* in those *dehaas*, and do all the acts according to that - this is said to be *vishesha jnyaana*, and the *karma* is said to be *vishesha karma*. 



In this *shloka*, we have to stop one sentence at *vishvametat*. This whole world is made of those who think that the body itself is the *aatman*, and they are engaged in those acts only according to whatever body they get. 



Up to *vishvametat* is told the *baddha svaroopa*. After that, from the word param onwards, to *paramaatmanaH* in *shloka* 54, the *para roopa* is told, which is *amoorta*, which is the *mukta svaroopa*. These are also commented in the *Shreebhaashyam* by *Bhaashyakaarar*. *Druk* is *jnyaana*, and *bhedabhinnadruk* means seeing the various differences in the bodies itself as differences in the *aatman* - one who thinks that the *aatman* is itself having all these differences and varieties. Those who are different from that, and those who are other than *Brahma, Sanaka, Sanandana*, etc., are said to para.

*Para* and *apara* - two forms are told, which are *moorta* and *amoorta*. *Para roopa* is *amoorta roopa*, and *apara roopa* is *moorta roopa*. The *para roopa* is being told now. 



*Para svaroopa* is *mukta*. They do not have this *praakruta shareera*. They do not have *jaati, varna*, etc. There is no difference like *manushya jaati, deva jaati* - this difference does not exist in the liberated self. That is why, they are beyond words, because we cannot call them as *deva, manushya*, etc., as we see in terms of the bound selves who belong to various classes. Among the *muktaas*, these classes do  [[142]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 not exist. So, they are said to be *vachasaam agocharam*. The *muktaas* cannot be called as *deva, manushya*, etc. 



There are six *bhaavaas* told, *shat bhaavaas - asti, jaayate, vardhate, **viparinamate, apaksheeyate, nashyati*. Out of these *shat bhaavaas*, five are not there for *muktaas*, and only *asti* is there. *Jaayate* \(gets born\), *vardhate* \(grows\), *viparinamate* \(undergoes changes\), *apaksheeyate* \(declines\), *nashyati* \(perishes\) are not there for the *muktaas*. 



They know themselves, they have *pratyaktva. Jnyaanam* means the *mukta* *svaroopa* can be established only with *jnyaatrutva, jnyaana guna*. One who has the *jnyaana*, but is said to be the *jnyaana* itself. This is the most essential characteristic of the nature of the *aatman*. This is told in a *Brahma sootra - Tat* *gunasaaratvaat tat vyapadeshah praajnyavat*. Because it is the *saarabhoota guna* of *jeevaatman*, the *jnyaatrutva*, it is said to be *jnyaana* itself. Just as *Paramaatman* is told *Aanando brahma. Niratishaya aananda svaroopa* is *aananda* *guna*. So, He is said to be *aananda* itself. 



The *jnyaana svaroopa* is also told to be *aatma samvedya, svayam prakaasha*. This itself says *jnyaana svaroopa. Jnyaana svaroopa* and *guna* are both established here. 



Because it is *Brahmaatmaka*, it is said to be *Brahma samjnitam*. It is said to be *Brahma*.

*Aroopa* is that which is different from *vishvaroopa. Vishvaroopa* is all the *baddha* *jeevaas*. That which is different from them, is *amoorta*. This is also a form of *Bhagavaan* only, as they are all *Brahmaatmaka*. This is said to be *amoorta* and *aroopaakhya*. And it is different from *moorta roopa*. This is said to be the *para* *roopa* of *Paramaatman*. 



 [[143]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Two *roopaas* of *Paramaatman* are told - *para roopa* and *apara roopa. Para roopa* is *amoorta*, and *apara roopa* is *moorta*, which is the *baddha svaroopa*. *Para roopa* is *mukta svaroopa*. Both are the forms of *Paramaatman*. Because they are also *Bhagavadaatmaka*, they are also forms of *Paramaatman*. However, the *baddhaas* and *muktaas* do not have *Shubhaashraya*; they are not fit to be object of meditation for a *mumukshu*, for a *bhagavat yogi*. This will be told now.

*Yogayuk* is one who is in any of the stages of *yoga* still. He has started *yoga*, and has not yet reached the final stage. One who has reached the final stage is said to be a *nishpanna yogi*. For a *yogayuk*, it is not possible to meditate upon the form of the Lord.

... all of these which have the *trividha bhaavanaas, brahma bhaavana, karma **bhaavana, ubhaya bhaavana*, this gross form of *Paramaatman*, though it can be meditated upon as it has a gross form, it has this *bhaavanaa traya*. Because of that, it is *ashuddha*, it is impure and not fit for meditation, it is not said to be *Shubhaashraya*, it is *ashubhaashraya. Idam vishvam* is the conclusion of whatever is told in this world. From *Jagadetat charaacharam* is a separate sentence. This is all said to be the *shakti* of *Vishnu* only. *Shakti, amsha, tanu, vapu, shareera* - all of these are *paryaaya padaas*, synonyms. This is controlled by *Paramaatman*, supported by Him, and meant for His purpose. He is the master of that. It is all *shakti* because it is supported by His *sankalpa shakti*. Just like our *shareera*, as our *Jeevaatman* is pervading the whole body, and is controlling by his willing only. In the same way, *Paramaatman* controls the whole world of sentients and non-sentients. There is another way of commenting on this, as told by some people.

The third *shakti* of *Paramaatman* is also going to be told. The first two are *paraa* *shakti*, and *aparaa shakti*, and the third is *avidyaa*. This is also called *karma*. The *paraa shakti* is the *mukta svaroopa*. The *kshetrajnyaas* are told as *aparaa*, told as *Hiranyagarbha*, etc., the bound selves. *Avidyaa* is the *yaaga* and other *karmaas*, performing which one gains all the fruits, and they are bound here. *Prakruti* *sambandha* is continuing because of this *avidyaa* for the sentients. The cause of this *prakruti sambandha* is said to be the third *shakti* of *Paramaatman*.

And they experience all the grief and difficulties in this *samsaara*. The *aadhyaatmika, aadhibhoutika, aadhidaivika taapaas*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 This *aparaa shakti* which was told as *kshetrajnyaas*, the bound selves, their knowledge is covered by *avidyaa*, which is the third shakti, karma. Their *dharmabhoota jnyaana* is contracted, covered. And it is relative in all the beings. For some, the *jnyaana* is more, and for some, it is less. The order in which the *jnyaana* varies is going to be told.

It is less for *manushyaas*, and more for *devaas*. For *muktaas*, it is in its original natural state, which is *ananta*, all pervading. Here, because of *avidyaa*, it is covered, and there is a relative difference among all the beings.

The *taaratamya*, the relative differences are told here. In mountains, in wooden pieces, it is very very less. The *jeevaatmans* who are there in all these are of the same nature. and they are all very subtle, *sookshma*; and there is no *vikaara* in their *svaroopa* at any point of time, either in the bound state or any state. There is no *vikaara* in the essential nature of *jeevaatman*. It is only in the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaana* that the contraction and expansion happens, and differences exist among the *jeevaatmans*. Being less and more is not in the *svaroopa*, but in the *jnyaana* *aananda dharma* only; they experience less happiness, and their knowledge is limited. In serpents and other beings, it is a little more than stone, wood. In birds, it is still more.

Compared to the birds, deer and other animals have more. *Pashus* like cow and others have still more. Humans have more than the *pashus*, with the *jnyaana* shakti which they have. The *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of humans is much more expanded, compared to cow and others.

*Indra's dharmabhoota jnyaana* is less contracted compared to the humans. Compared to all the *devaas*, the *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of *Indra* is much more. More or less means that it is covered by *avidyaa*. It is always in its original state, and in *moksha* also, it is not newly created. It is like a diamond or gem being covered by dust. When the dust is removed, it shines in its original state. The shine is not newly created. In the same way, the *dharmabhoota jnyaana* of all the sentient beings is covered with more or less dust, so that the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaana* is less or more expanded. The difference is only in this. *Indra* has the maximum *dharmabhoota jnyaana* compared to all the *devaas*. *Prajaapati* has more than *Indra. Hiranyagarbha* has much more. These are the relative differences in *dharmabhoota jnyaana*.

Those who do not have *praana* in them, like mountain, which does not breathe, from *apraani vastu* to *Hiranyagarbha*, whatever were told, are all His *shareera*. *Roopa, amsha, shakti, tanu, vapu, shareera* are all *paryaaya padaas*. Just as a man's body is pervaded by his *sankalpa shakti*, this entire thing is pervaded by *Bhagavaan's sankalpa shakti*, and is controlled and supported by Him, by His mere *sankalpa* itself. By His mere willing, He can support and control everything. That is why it is said to be His *shareera*. His *sankalpa saamarthya* is told here. His *sankalpa* is present everywhere.

*Bhagavaan's moorta roopa* is the *apara roopa, apara shakti*; and *amoorta roopa* is *para roopa*. The *moorta roopa* was told so far, how the *dharmabhoota* *jnyaanaas* are varying, and though it is *sthoola*, it is *ashubhaashraya*, and is not fit for meditation by a *bhagavat yogi*, this is the *bhaavanaa trayaatmaka roopa*; all the *baddhaas* have *bhaavanaa traya*. The second one, is called *Vishnu Samjnyaa*, *Vishnu*, and it is told to be fit for meditation by a *yogi*, and is said to be *amoorta* *roopa* of *Paramaatman. Muktaas* do not have the *bhaavanaa traya*. 



Now, the *mukta, amoorta roopa* is being told here. This is told as *sattaa **maatram*. This can be meditated upon by a *nishpanna yogi*, one who has come to the *dhaaranaa* stage. This is also called by the name *Vishnu*, as it is all *Brahmaatmaka*. This form will be told now, and *Bhagavaan's divya mangala* *vigraha* is going to be told in detail, which we see next. This *divya mangala **vigraha* only is fit for meditation by *bhagavat yogi*. The *para* and *apara roopaas* are not fit for meditation by a *bhagavat yogi*. 



From *Chaturmukha Brahma* to the lowest beings in this world, all are having this *bhaavanaa traya* - the *Brahma bhaavanaa, Karma bhaavanaa, Ubhaya* [[149]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *bhaavanaa*. So, they are all *Bhaavanaa trayaatmaka*. The one without *Bhaavanaa* *traya* is called *amoorta roopa*, and it is *mukta roopa*. 



One who is still in any of the *angaas* of *yoga* is said to be a *prakraanta yogi*, who is professing his *yoga*, who has not reached the final stage. Only a *nishpanna yogi* can think of the *mukta svaroopa*. So, the *moorta, amoorta* are both told. 



Now, will be told the *Bhagavat roopa*. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching the nature of *yoga* to *Khaandikya Janaka*, the *bhagavat yoga, bhakti yoga*. First, he described about the various *angaas* of *yoga - yama, niyama, aasana*, etc. Now, for *dhaaranaa*, he is talking about the object of meditation. Before telling about the *Bhagavat divya mangala vigraha*, as the *upaasya*, he is telling about the two forms of *Paramaatman, moorta* and *amoorta*. 



Where the *moorta roopa* is all the forms seen in this world, having *chetanaas* and *achetanaas*, which are all *shareera* to Him - *roopa* is also told as *shareera, shakti* - He is all pervading through His *sankalpa*. Just like a *jeevaatman* pervaded this body, *Bhagavaan* is pervading the entire world, consisting of the sentients and non-sentients. He is controlling and supporting all of them. 



Then, he tells about the *amoorta roopa*, which is said to be *sattaa maatra*. *Sattaamaatram agocharam vachasaam* was told earlier. This is the form being told here. This is the *mukta svaroopa*. And it is said to be *yogi dhyeya* in the sense that it can be meditated upon only by a *yogi*, who has already perfected his *yoga*, a *nishpanna yogi*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 It was told about three *shaktis* of *Paramaatman* - *para roopa, apara roopa* and *karma/avidyaa. Para shakti* is the *muktaas, aparaa shakti* is all the *baddhaas*, and *avidyaa/karma* is another *shakti* because of which *jeevaatmans* get associated with *prakruti*. All these three *shaktis* are established in *Bhagavaan's roopa*, which is very different from all these. This is told here. 



After having told about the three *shaktis* which are all residing in *Bhagavaan's* *divya mangala vigraha*, in the form of *astraas, bhooshanaas*, all the weapons, dress, ornaments, etc., which are all the various *shaktis*, the *abhimaani devataas* of various *tattvaas*. They are all eternally supported by Him, under His control. And *Bhagavaan* who is told as the sole cause of this world, only He is *Shubhaashraya* is being told in this shloka. 



*Bhagavaan's divya mangala vigraha* is *apraakruta*, different from the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, and it is *vilakshana* compared to the world form, *vishvaroopa*. The *pramaanaas* are told here. The colour is told - *aaditya varna*, and is beyond the *tamo loka, prakruti mandala*. The *Paramapada* is *hiranmaya*, it has got that kind of *jyoti*, lustre. It has got a wonderful robe. His eyes are like the broad and fresh petals of a lotus. When one realizes, and gets a vivid perception, it will be not like a dream. The dream that we get is like a defect when tamas increases, whereas, with effort, with *bhakti yoga*, if one achieves that state, then they get a vivid perception. This is like that. It is a gross form. It is great even from the point of view of the *gunaas*, qualities of *Bhagavaan*. This form of *Bhagavaan* is established through various *shruti pramaanaas*.

That which is abode for all the *shaktis*, that form of *Bhagavaan*, is for the good of the world, and is His own sport. Creation and others are all His *leelaa*. These two  [[151]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *shlokaas* tell about *deva, tiryak, manushya, sthaavara* - the four kinds of creation which He does. He also incarnates in all these forms. He acts as though He is also a deva, He is also a *manushya*, He is also a *tiryak*, when he incarnates in these forms. When He incarnates in these forms, He also acts like them, the *cheshtaas*, the acts He does will be similar to them. These are all His *avataara roopaas*. He does these, it is said in these two *shlokaas*. In every *kalpa*, He does fourteen deva *avataaraas*. In each *Manvantara*, He incarnates as a *deva, Vishnu* is one of His *avataaraas* only, among *Chaturmukha Brahma, Rudra, Vishnu*, He is His own *avataara* only. *Matsya, Koorma, Varaaha* are all *tiryak avataaraas. Raama, **Krishna* are *manushya avataaraas*. He does out of His own sport, and not because of any other benefit for Him, for gaining something. There is another *paatha*.

When He incarnates as a human, He acts like a human. We can see this in *Raama* *avataara, Krishna avataara*. It is only for the good of the world that He does that. It is not because He is experiencing the fruits of *karma* done earlier. Because He is *karmaadhyaksha*, and not *karma vashya*. He is *Sarveshvara*, and not like a bound self. This is there in all the *jaatis - deva, manushya*, etc. He is not born like the bound selves here, He incarnates out of His own will. Whatever wonderful acts He did, *leelaa cheshtitaas*, in *Brindaavana, Gokula*, in controlling the *Kaaliya sarpa*, they are unopposed. Nobody can stop Him or oppose Him, or go against Him. *Raavana, Shishupaala, Baana*, and others - nobody can stop or face Him. He overpowers everyone. The *avataaraas* are said to be not *karma nimitta*, not for experiencing the fruits of the *karma*, like the *baddha jeevaas*; the *leelaas* of the Lord do not come under *bhaavanaa traya*, like the bound selves, Because of this, the *avataara roopaas* are also *Shubhaashraya* only.

The *baddha, mukta* forms are all His own form only. They are all His *shareera*, His *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas. Tat roopa* means all His forms, which are *para*, *vyooha, vibhava, antaryaami* and *archaa* - these are the forms to be meditated upon, by one who is engaged in *yoga*. This destroys all the *karmaas* of one. Cleansing of the self means getting rid of the *karmaas*. One who is engaged in *yoga* has to meditate upon that.

One who is performing *yoga*, can establish this kind of a form in his mind, and then can meditate upon it, and this is the form in which *dhaaranaa* is to be done. This is to be established firmly, steadily in the mind.

The reason why the *Shubhaashraya* is beyond the *tribhaavanaa*, is told here. It can be *Shubhaashraya* or *Shuddhaashraya. Bhagavaan* by Himself is *sarvagata*, He is all pervading, and He moves over everywhere. He is everywhere. He is *vyaapta, ananta*. His *svaroopa* itself is *vibhu*. He also moves around everywhere. With respect to something which is totally different, He is *achala*. His *vailakshanya* is told here. He is different and distinct from everything else. That is why He is said to be *Shubhaashraya*. His *avataara roopaas* are also beyond the *bhaavanaa traya*, and also they bestow liberation, moksha. They are *moksha* *kaarana*. Because of this, *shubha* and *aashraya* are both there. They can be meditated upon, and also they bestow the ultimate benefit, *moksha*. This is told in *Smruti* and other places. *Krishna* says in *Bhagavad Geetha* as "One who knows like this". One who establishes his mind on *Nrusimha, Vaamana* - these *avataara* *roopaas* are also *Shubhaashraya* only. In *Saatvata Puraana*, it is said that a man has ten *indriyaas*, and is compared with *Raavana*, who has got ten heads, the manas itself is the *raakshasa*, like *Raavana* - the mind, with the ten sense organs, and with the bow and arrows which is nothing bur *Viveka*, one can control the mind, and just as *Sri Raama* destroyed *Raavana* with the power of His arrows, a *yogi* with *viveka, upaasanaa*, goes forth and controls all these sense organs. He is the one to be meditated upon, and His hue is like the sea. His eyes are blood red, and like a red lotus. He has got bow and arrows. His *Shubhaashraya* is described, and His *avataara roopaas* are all to be meditated upon by a *yogi* in order to get liberated.

All others are *ashuddhaas*, it is said. The *baddha* and *mukta roopaas* told, the *moorta* and *amoorta roopaas*, are all *ashuddhaas*, are *ashubhaashrayaas*, they are different from *bhagavat roopa*. It is told clearly that from *Chaturmukha* Brahma to the lowest being, which are all there in this *prakruti mandala*, which are having a body, and are *baddha*, are all born because of the fruits of experiencing their *karma*. They are all under the sway of *samsaara*, going in the cycle of birth and death. All the *baddha jeevaas* are not fit for *dhyaana* by a *yogi*. They themselves are having *avidyaa, karma*, and they are in *samsaara*, so they cannot be meditated upon by one who is desirous of liberation, *moksha*. Those who have escaped this *samsaara*, and have got rid of all their *karma*, their *jnyaana* is in its proper full state, original state, they have got the *jnyaana*; they are also not useful for one who is engaged in *dhyaana*; because their *jnyaana* is not natural; they were bound selves at one time, and with *Bhagavaan's **anugraha*, His grace, they got rid of this *karma*, and then they became *muktaas*; so the *jnyaana* was always not there for them. So, the *Brahman* who is eternally having *asankuchita* *jnyaana, Satyam jnyaanam anantam Brahma*, is only to be meditated upon, as told by *Shounaka*. This is also told in the *Mahaabhaarata*, that they are all in this *samsaara* only. *Manu, Mahaabhaarata*, and *Puraanaas* are given as *pramaana* here. They are told as *ashuddhaas* because of *karmayonitva*.

O King, what is the *sthoola roopa* of *Bhagavaan*? How is it to be meditated upon? That I am going to tell you, listen to me. *Keshidhvaja* said. *Dhaaranaa* cannot be done without thinking about a form in the mind. Something has to be established in the mind. The mind needs an *aadhaara* for *dhaaranaa*. One has to establish a form in the mind, and then meditate upon it. Without that, it is not possible. What is the form to be established in the mind for *dhyaana*, is now told as the *Bhagavad roopa*, the *divya mangala vigraha*, the most wonderful description of *Bhagavat divya mangala vigraha*.

First, it is said that he has to meditate *Bhagavaan* with all the *astra, bhooshana*. Now, the second kind of meditation is told here. This second form of meditation is with only *bhooshanaas*, without the *Shankha, Gadaa, Chakra, Shaarnga*. The first form is *astra* and *bhooshana*. The *Bhagavaan's* form is to be meditated upon, with *sphatika akshamaalaa, yajnyopaveeta*, etc.

The next stage is without *bhooshanaas* also, thinking about all the various *angaas* of *Bhagavaan*. Mainly concentrating on the *angaas* or *avayavas* of *Bhagavaan*. After establishing and mastering the *dhaaranaa* of *bhooshanaas*, one has to meditate without the *bhooshanaas*.

Then, he has to think of each *avayava* of *Bhagavaan*. This is the fourth dhaaranaa, with the *angaas* of *Bhagavaan*. The *aayudhaas, bhooshanaas*, the various *angaas* of *Bhagavaan*, with the continuous practice and meditation, when it is firmly established in the mind, and then only one *avayava*, having the *Bhagavaan's* form, this is to be meditated upon. This is giving importance to one *avayava* at a time, and then this is told as *dhyaana*. Till this, it is *dhaaranaa*, and now it is *dhyaana*. The *avayavi* is said to be of *gomukhaakaara*, and one has to do *dhyaana* in that.

This is the form of *dhyaana*. When once *dhaaranaa* is established, this is the same as *tailadhaaraavat avicchinna smruti santati roopaa*, what *Bhaashyakaarar* says, that there should be no other thought coming in between two thoughts. This is *saalambana yoga*. In the *astra bhooshana adhyaaya*, the form that is meditated upon, with *astra, bhooshana*, is said to be *sabeeja yoga*. 



The *dhyaana* is now established with the six *angaas - yama, niyama, aasana, **praanaayaama, pratyaahaara, dhaaranaa*. Now is told the *dhyaana. Samaadhi* is next.

This is *samaadhi*, said to be *Nirbeeja yoga*. The meditation with *astra, bhooshana* is *Sabeeja yoga*. That which is realized with the *sapta angaas* of *yoga*, up to *dhyaana*, is called *Nirbeeja yoga*, and this is *Bhagavaan's* essential nature. This means, One who is meditated upon with all the *divya mangala vigraha, astra*, *bhooshana* - thinking that He does not have *naama, roopa* like what we see in this world, and that there are not the *shat bhaava vikaaraas, asti iti kevalam*, who is without any *vikaaraas*, with this, the *svaroopa grahana* has to be done. This is to be achieved through meditation in the mind. This is said to be *samaadhi*. The  [[160]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 previous chapter is told as *para vidyaa* and *apara vidyaa. Apara vidyaa* is *shaastra* *janya jnyaana, para vidyaa* is as told in the *Mundakopanishad*, is the *vivekaja* *jnyaana*, which is *upaasanaatmaka*. This is already established in the *Astra **bhooshana adhyaaya* for one who has all these attributes - *astra, bhooshana*, who is *vishishta* with all these things, such a *Bhagavaan* having the *divya mangala* *vigraha*. One can meditate upon the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan*, starting with the meditation on the *divya mangala vigraha*, with all the *astraas* and *bhooshanaas*, the most resplendent form of *Bhagavaan*, and then thinking without the *astraas* thinking about the same form, without the *bhooshanaas* thinking about the same form, and meditating upon the *svaroopa* of *Bhagavaan*. Always, *Bhagavaan* is qualified by all these things, but the focus is on the *svaroopa, astra, bhooshanaas*; without this, it is not possible to proceed in this form. Without this, it is not possible to achieve. One should not leave them away, but this is the way to progress. Finally, the one who is to be attained, *Bhagavaan*, is qualified by all of these, *astraas, bhooshanaas, vigraha*, as per *Tat kratu nyaaya - "Yathaa **kraturasmin loke purusho bhavati, tathaa itah pretya bhavati*" - "As one meditates, he attains that only; whatever form one meditates upon, he attains that", so if he meditates upon *jeevaatman*, he attains *jeevaatman* only. If one meditates upon *Bhagavaan*, he attains that. *Bhagavaan's* form is having all of these - *divya mangala vigraha, astra, bhooshana*, so meditation is only upon such a form, and not leaving all those things. However, one can focus more and more on various aspects, as what is told in the four ways of *dhaaranaa*. One who attains *Bhagavaan* in the final stage, the ultimate stage, is the *Bhagavaan* having the *divya mangala vigraha*, and the *astra, bhooshana*, etc.

The attainer is *aatman*, and this kind of *vijnyaana*, which is the *saadhanaa* for attaining *Bhagavaan* is told here. This *vijnyaana*, told up to *samaadhi*, this *yoga*, is the one which helps one to attain *Paramaatman*. Just like *Parabrahman*, he will  [[161]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 also be getting rid of all his blemish, his *karma bandha, prakruti sambandha*; he will get rid of *bhaavanaa traya*, the *bhagavat upaasaka* is the attainer. This is also told in the *Shruti* - one who meditates upon *Brahman* attains *Brahman*. The *pramaanaas* about *upaasanaa* are given here.

It is not only that it will lead one to *Brahman*, but also will make one get liberated. *Kshetrajnya* is the *jeevaatman, upaasaka*, who is meditating, is the *karani*. The *karana, saadhana* is *jnyaana*, the *upaasana*. It will definitely give him the fruit of *mukti*, and then only will it return, it is told here. He has to do until he gets *moksha, aharahah anustheya*, this *bhakti yoga* he has to perform everyday, he will attain *moksha*. The *prakruti*, which is *guna traya*, called *maayaa*, in the form of *kshetra*, the *shareera*, his *svaroopa* is covered by that. *Karani* is one who performs the *upaasanaa. Karana*, the instrument is *upaasanaa*, the *samaadhi* *roopa jnyaana*. It will not end before getting him liberation. He has to perform this till he gets liberation. 



It will get him liberation, and he will never return to *samsaara* again. *Kshetrajnya* is one whose real nature is covered by the veil of *prakruti*, and *maayaa* which is *trigunaatmaka*, consisting of *sattva, rajas, tamas*, since beginningless time. *Karani* means one who performs, executes the means to *moksha*. The *jnyaana* of the form of *samaadhi*, is the instrument, the means. It will not get over before he gets liberation. It will take him up to that. This is the power of *samaadhi*, he says. Now, the *moksha svaroopa* is told in the next *shloka*.

This is said to be the *moksha svaroopa. Tadbhaava bhaavam* means *Bhagavaan's* *svabhaava*, which is *apahata paapmatva, vijarah, vimrutyuh, vishokah*, etc. - these will be *aavirbhaava*, that means that these will not be created, but will be in his natural state, because it was covered, like the dust covered on a gem; if the dust is removed, it will shine forth in its original form. He will be not different from *Paramaatman*, he will be in the same form as *Bhagavaan*, He will attain similarity with *Bhagavaan*, is the meaning. *Bheda* is the *deva, manushya* and other forms, which he was in the bound state, because of the ignorance in the form of *karma*, because of which he thought he was *deva, manushya*, etc.; having got rid of all his blemish, he attains similarity with *Paramaatman*, he will be in his original form. Having attained *Paramaatman*, he will get *samaana dharma*, *saadharmya*, with *Bhagavaan. Svaroopa aikya*, identity cannot be told here, because *bhaava bhaava* is told, and the second *bhaava* will be futile in this case, it will not be meaningful. That would again become repetition. One *dravya* cannot become another *dravya*, even when they are mixed together. Though they may be like a river merging into the sea, both are called as sea, as the river leaves its name and form; but the particles of the river are still present, and there is no *svaroopa naasha* or *svaroopa* *aikya* with *samudra*. It becomes one with *samudra* means that it will also have the same form, similarity, that is what is meant here also. These are all explained here. *Abheda* does not mean *svaroopa naasha* and identity with *Bhagavaan*, but it means similarity, *saamya* with *Bhagavaan, guna **saamya*. 



This tells about the *mukti svaroopa*. This is explained in detail by *Sri Engal **Aalwaan. Tadbhaavabhaavan* means the *bhaavaas* of *Parabrahman*, which are *apahata paapmaa, vijarah, vimrutyuh, vishokah, vijighatsah, apipaasah, **satyakaamah, satyasankalpah*, the *ashta gunaas* which are told, which are present in the *jeevaatman* also, in the *upaasaka*, but are covered by the veil of *prakruti*. When the cover is removed, it will be in its original natural state; this is called *aavirbhaava*. So, the *jeevaatman* will also get the *ashta gunaas* like  [[163]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Paramaatman*. He gets *abheda* with *Paramaatman*, his *svaroopa* will also be *jnyaana aananda*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will be equal to that of *Paramaatman*. The *abheda* told here is to be interpreted as told in the commentary - that he becomes similar to Him, becomes similar to *Paramaatman* with the forms of *jnyaana* and *aananda. Jeevaatman* and *Paramaatman* - are they identical or are they different, what happens in the *mukti svaroopa*, is explained. Will the *jeevaatman* lose his *svaroopa* and merge into *Paramaatman*, or will he join *Paramaatman* and get the form similar to *Paramaatman*. This is what is explained here. It is said that there is similarity, and he does not lose his essential nature. There is no *svaroopa naasha* in *moksha*; if it were so, then nobody would desire for such a *moksha. Shrutis* say clearly that there is similarity attained by the *jeevaatman* with *Paramaatman*. The *bheda* is explained - *jeevaatman* is also *jnyaana aananda maya, jnyaana aananda svaroopa*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* is eternally having all the good qualities, but due to *prakruti sambandha*, it is covered and contracted. Now, when the *prakruti* *sambandha* goes off, the association with matter is removed and destroyed once and for all, he will be in his original state, which is similar to *Paramaatman*. 



The difference is - when he was associated with *prakruti*, he was born as *deva*, *manushya, tiryak, krimi, keeta, sthaavara*, based on each one's *karma*, which is happening from *anaadi kaala*, beginningless time. The *bheda* came because of the *karma, anaadi karma. Karma* is also *anaadi*. Because *jeevaatman* is *anaadi*, *karma* is also *anaadi*. The *karmaas* which a *jeevaatman* does lead to *Bhagavaan's* *anugraha* or *nigraha*, which are called *punya* and *paapa*, and that is going on getting accumulated. When he transgresses the *shaastraas*, there will be *nigraha*, punishment; *Bhagavaan* will do a *sankalpa* that he has to be punished for this. When he follows the *shaastraas* and does all things right, there will be *anugraha*, and *Paramaatman* will grace him, this is *punya*. The *jeevaatman* has to experience the fruits of all the *karmaas* that he has done. For this he gets bodies, and different kinds of bodies based on the *punya* and *paapa* that he has accumulated. Again, he identifies himself with the body, and again gets into all kinds of *karma*. If he gets into the body of a cow, he will act like a cow, he will do all the *karmaas* like a cow, similarly when he gets into the bodies of a human or *deva*. As when *Keshidhvaja* is teaching *Khaandikya Janaka*, when he gets an *aachaarya* and does *upaasanaa*, he gets rid of this body once and for all, and he will be in his liberated state. Then he will be *abhedi* with *Paramaatman*, similar to *Paramaatman*, because he is also *jnyaana aananda maya*. He is *anu*, his *svaroopa* is *jnyaana aananda*, and his *dharma bhoota jnyaana* will become equal to that of *Paramaatman. Deva aadi roopa* is the *bheda* here. This *bheda* is due to *karma* *roopa ajnyaana*. 



 [[164]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 This is told in *Shrutis* as he gets *parama saamya*, ultimate similarity with respect to the *dharma, dharma bhoota jnyaana*, and *apahata paapmatva aadi gunaas*. He will not become *vibhu* in *svaroopa*, he will not be all pervasive in his essential nature, he will be atomic. He will be subtle, and his essential nature will be *ati* *sookshma*. He will not have the capability to enter into all the beings, *antaryaamitva*. He will not be capable of *jagat srushti, paalana, samhaara*. He will enjoy the ultimate bliss similar to that of *Paramaatman*. The similarity is with respect to that aspect only. He will not be tainted by *karma, prakruti*. 



He goes near *Paramaatman*, and touches Him, *sparsha*, and the *paryanka vidyaa* is told in the *Upanishads*. He gets evolved in his original form, and the veil of *karma* is removed. Having attained *Paramaatman*, his *svaroopa aavirbhaava* happens. *Baadaraayana* clearly says this in the *Brahma Sutraas. Bhagavaan **Krishna* says in the *Bhagavad Geeta* that he gets *samaana dharmatva. Svaroopa **aikya* does not happen. There is no *svaroopa naasha*. 



The defects in the other proposition are told. If there is *svaroopa aikya*, the words told here *tadbhaava bhaavam*, the second *bhaava* will be meaningless. If there is *svaroopa aikya*, only one *bhaava* would be sufficient. So, there is no identity, there is only similarity. *Abhedi bhavati* would also become repetition. The meaning of *yoga* given in the other proposition is identity, where *jeevaatma* *svaroopa* merges into *Paramaatma svaroopa* and loses its *svaroopa*; that cannot be true, because as told in the *Vishnu Puraana* itself earlier, one object cannot become another object. 



When there is merger of two objects, they maintain their *svaroopa*, but they can become one, as in if we add one-half tumbler of water into another half-tumbler of water, both will become water only. If a river merges into the sea, they will both be called sea only, we say that they merge into each other; but the particles, atoms of the river will still remain there only, and will not get destroyed in the ocean. But, it may lose its name and form which was there earlier. Similarly, *jeevaatman* also loses his name and form which *deva, manushya*, etc., and will attain a state similar to *Paramaatman* with respect to his *jnyaana aananda* *gunaas*. There will be contradictions with the *Shruti* statements if we don't say so. This is the *mukti svaroopa*. 



There are some more important *shlokaas* coming next. 



We are studying Chapter 7 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Keshidhvaja* is teaching *Khaandikya Janaka* about *Bhagavat yoga, upaasanaa*, how *dhyaana* is to be done to attain *samaadhi*. He was telling that such a kind of *bhakti yoga*, will definitely get one *moksha*, liberation.  [[165]] of 194

The *moksha svaroopa* is only explained here. The differences with respect to *deva, manushya*, etc., his *karma* gets completely destroyed when he sees *Paramaatman* and goes and joins Him. The *ajnyaana*, ignorance of the nature of *karma*, is the cause of various differences like various forms of *deva, manushya*, etc. When that is destroyed completely with the *darshana* of *Paramaatman*, with the *aatman* being *jnyaanaika roopa* itself, then who will say that he is *deva*, or he is *manushya*, then the *aatma Paramaatma saamya* with respect to *jnyaana* *aakaaratva svaroopa* and in the *jnyaana dharma*, the similarity will be there. That *jeevaatman* is *anu*, and *Paramaatman* is *vibhu* will remain, but both will be of the nature of consciousness. One will not differentiate like *deva, manushya*. *Shounaka's* words are also told as *pramaana* here. The four kinds of *bheda* told here - *deva, manushya, tiryak, sthaavara*, is because of the *ajnyaana* which is happening due to *karma*.

I have told you briefly and also in detail. What else do you want to know?"

With this *upadesha* instruction of yours, all the impurities in my mind are completely destroyed now. I have nothing else to ask of you. 



He shows the indication that he has absorbed the knowledge, which *Keshidhvaja* has taught him. He said that "My mind has become pure".

I said "My, mine, that I have heard everything, my mind has now been cleared". These words "I, mine", without using these words, I cannot convey you these. That is why I told, and not with any other reason. I have lost this *ahamkaara*, *mamakaara*. If I tell that my mind is pure, then it may mean that I still have *ahamkaara*, but that is not what I am meaning here. I am not having any *ahamkaara, mamakaara*. When the impurities are all destroyed, I still have to tell that "My mind". When the complete impurities are destroyed, I should not even be using *aham, mama*, but those who have understood the truth, and are trying to tell, even those who have realized the ultimate, cannot convey this without using those words. That is why I am using that, he says.

*Aham, mama* are *avidyaa jnyaana*, thinking one as something else. He is a man, she is a woman, this is a cow, horse, is also *avidyaa*, it is not the right knowledge, because all are *jnyaana aakaaraas, aatmans* only. All the differences, what I said, are due to *avidyaa* only, *bhramaa*. It is the wrong knowledge. The truth is that *aatman* is eternal, and we cannot express by words. We cannot talk about him. We cannot say that this *aatman* is goat, this is buffalo, etc; we cannot use these words to indicate an *aatman*. Because all *aatmans* are *jnyaana aakaaraas* only. He cannot be told using these words. Because these are all coming due to *prakruti* *sambandha* and not in his real nature.

Concentrating on *Bhagavaan* only, with *yama, niyama, aasana*, etc., having perfected all of that, he merged into *Vishnu*, who is *nirmala, Parabrahman*. 



The meaning of *laya* is told in the commentary. *Laya* is the complete destruction of the *naama, roopa, karma*. He got this when he attained *Vishnu*. This is told in the *Shrutis*. Just like the rivers. The river is called *Gangaa*, and it has a form, that it is flowing like this, and that is *Yamunaa* river, this is *Kaaveri* river, etc., and they all go and merge into the ocean. When they go into the ocean, inside the ocean, we cannot say that "this is river *Gangaa*, this is river *Kaaveri*, this is river *Yamunaa*". They leave their form and name and merge into the ocean. But they don't lose their essential nature. Similarly, *jeevaatman* attains *moksha*, in the same way. 



Just as a horse shakes off its mane, similarly, the *jeevaatman* shakes off all his *punya* and *paapa karmaas* and attains liberation. The knots in the heart, the *raaga, dvesha, karma*, everything gets destroyed. Being untainted by *karma*, he attains ultimate similarity with *Paramaatman*. These are all told in the *Shrutis*. There is no *svaroopa aikya*, it is not identity of nature, *jeevaatman* does not lose his essential nature. This is also seen clearly in the *nitya, naimittika* and *praakruta* *laya*. It is told that in *sushupti*, deep sleep, we go and attain *Paramaatman*, we get *laya*; it is said that *jeevaatman* merges into *Paramaatman* in deep sleep, but he again comes back, he becomes the same thing whatever he was earlier, when he wakes up; and he remembers all the things that he remembered earlier, whatever he had done the previous day; he becomes whatever he was earlier; this is proof that he has not lost his essential nature, because he again comes back. Like this, it can be seen in *naimittika* and *praakruta pralaya*. 



If the *jeevaatman* had lost his nature, what would have happened? When he dies, for example, and gets into another body, when a human dies and gets born as a  [[169]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 horse or cow, he will become the cow or horse only to experience the fruits of his *karma*, and he will get body of a cow or a horse. If the nature of *jeevaatman* itself gets totally destroyed when he dies, and if he gets into the body of a cow, then he will have to experience *karmaas* which he had not done, because his nature would have been destroyed completely and created again. Or whatever good or bad things he would have done in his human life, will not be giving fruit at all if he loses his nature completely. This is called *kruta vipranaasha*, the fruits of the *karma* done will get destroyed if his nature gets completely destroyed; or he will have to experience the fruits of *karmaas* he has not done; this is not as per *shaastraas*, and this is not true. We experience the fruits of acts that we have done only, and not otherwise. 



If this were not true, then *Eeshvara* also will have the defects, because if a *jeevaatman* gets into the body of a cow, and someone becomes a human, someone becomes a *deva*, why should *Eeshvara* create like this, if all of them lost their essential nature, and if it was newly created? This differentiation, *vaishamya*, will be a defect on the part of *Eeshvara*. And also there will be *nairghrunya*, because some of them will experience grief all the time, some of them will experience happiness; why should *Paramaatman* subject someone to grief for no reason, there would be cruelty on the part of *Brahman*. Whereas *Brahman* is told to be without any defects, *akhila heya pratyaneekatva*, His nature is far from any defects. He does not have any defects, as also told in the *Sutraas*. 



So, *jeevaatman's anaadi karma* is only responsible, and *jeevaatmans* are also there from beginningless time. They get their bodies as per their *karmaas*, and they experience grief or happiness, and *Eeshvara* is only a creator. *Eeshvara* does the act of creation, but choosing the body is based on their *karmaas* only. All this will be proper only if *jeevaatmans* do not lose their essential nature. If they lose their essential nature itself, then none of these will be right. There would be a lot of contradictions in the *shaastraas* then. 



In the *Aatyantika laya, moksha*, he will not get another body. This is the difference compared to *nitya, naimittika, praakruta laya*, where he will be again in this *samsaara* and will get another body, again and again, whereas in the *Aatyantika laya, moksha*, he will never return to *samsaara* again.

*Keshidhvaja*, for the purpose of liberation, in order to destroy all his *karmaas* which were there, he performed acts without any desire for fruits therein, and with the *mamataa tyaaga, kartrutva tyaaga, sambandha tyaaga, phala tyaaga*, without any desire in the fruits, and with *Bhagavat aaraadhana roopa*. And he also enjoyed based on the *karma*, without any attachment, because it has to be destroyed. The *praarabdha karmaas*, which have started to give fruits, have to be experienced. But there should be no attachment to any of that. If something bad happens, he will experience it, but he will not have any attachment to the fruits. If something good happens also, he will experience without any attachment. *Keshidhvaja* was doing like this.

Now, Chapter Eight. This is mostly about the *phala*, and what was told in the entire *Vishnu Puraana*, is summarized by *Paraasharar* here. *Paraasharar* also tells  [[171]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 the fruits, benefits for someone who studies this most sacred work about *Vishnu*, the *Vishnu Puraana*, which he taught all this time to *Maitreyar*, the benefits of listening to this teaching, doing *manana*, he will tell here.
