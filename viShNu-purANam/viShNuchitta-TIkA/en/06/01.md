*Maitreya* - In the first *Amsha, Paraasharar* told about creation. After *srushti, sthiti* was told in second, third and fourth *Amshaas*. After creation, *Vamsha*, *Vamshaanucharita, Manvantara*, are about the sustenance part. This was told in detail.

Now, I would like to listen about pralaya from you. About the *mahaa pralaya*, and *kalpaanta upasamhruti, kalpaanta pralaya*. About the *pralaya* which happens at the end of the *kalpa*, and also the *mahaa pralaya*, I would like to listen from you.

*Sri Paraasharar - O Maitreya*, do listen. I am going to tell you how *pralaya* happens at the end of the *kalpa*, and also the *praakruta pralaya*, how it happens. 



There are two halves - first *Paraardha* and second *Paraardha*. In this, whatever is the pralaya which is going to be told, that will be at the end of the *dviteeya* *Paraardha* of *Chaturmukha Brahma*. I will tell you that.

One month of humans is the day and night of *pitrus*. One year of *manushyaas* is the day and night of *devaas*. At the end of two thousand *chaturyugaas*, is *Brahma's* day and night. One thousand *chaturyugaas* is day for *Brahma*, and one more thousand *chaturyugaas* is night of *Brahma*.

By nature, means by their measure, and dharma and adharma, how much is there, and how they are there, the *chaturyugaas* are all very similar. *Harivamsha* is quoted here. *Dharma* is standing on four legs in *Kruta yuga*, and *adharma* is there in one *paada* towards the end of *Kruta yuga*. In *Tretaa yuga, dharma* is standing on three legs, and *adharma* in two legs. In the *Dvaapara yuga, dharma* is standing on two legs, and *adharma* on three legs. In *Kali yuga, adharma* is on four legs. The meaning of this is that in the beginning, at the end of *Kruta yuga* itself, *adharma* is on one *paada*. Then *adharma* gradually increases, becomes two, three, and becomes four at the start of *Kali yuga*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 In the beginning, how *Chaturmukha Brahma* creates, in the same way, at the end of *Kali yuga*, he does *upasamhaara*, dissolution happens by *Chaturmukha **Brahma*. 



*Chaturmukha Brahma* creates means that *Bhagavaan* is *antaryaami* to *Chaturmukha Brahma*. So, *Bhagavaan* Himself, through *Chaturmukha Brahma* does the creation. This is the uniqueness of beginning and end because there is creation and dissolution.

*Varnaashrama dharmaas* which are told in *Smrutis* in detail - are not present in *Kali yuga*, people do not follow them. The *Rig, Yajus, Saama Vedaas* are there - these are *Shrouta*; whatever are told there - *Agnihotra* and other *dharmaas*, which are told there, and by performance of that only is dharma established. This  [[4]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 does not happen in *Kali yuga*. People do not follow *Agnihotra* and other dharma *kaaryaas* which are told in the *Vedaas*, in the *Kali yuga*. So, they are not there.

*Vivaaha* does not happen as told in the *Shaastraas*. Even the order of student and teacher does not exist. The husband-wife system is also not there. Offering *havis* through *Agni* to the *devataas* through *yajnya yaagaas* is also not there. 



*Dharmya* means *dharmaat anapetam*, which is in line with dharma. 



The dharma of husband and wife, offering *havis* to *devataas*, is not there - the *anusthaana* of these does not happen.

Whichever *kula* one is born, if powerful, he only rules over, he becomes *sarveshvara*. In all the *varnaas*, one who is rich becomes powerful, and not by his character, education, wisdom. Only one who is rich is sought after for marriage.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 



The *Brahmins* who take *deeksha*, through *samskaaraas* - the *mukha kalpa* is not followed, only the *anukalpa* is followed. *Anukalpaas* are told for those who are incapable of following the *mukhya kalpa*. In *Kali yuga*, only *anukalpaas* are followed, and *mukhya kalpaas* are not followed. And they do *praayaschitta* by any means, and not as told in the *shaastraas*.

Everything is *shaastra* in *Kali yuga*. Whoever says anything becomes *shaastra*. *Avaidika* like *Kaali* also become *devataas*. Every god is treated as *devataa*, whoever is worshipped. If *Brahmacharya* is not there also, he can get married. If *vairaagya* is not there also, he can become *sannyaasi*. Like this, anyone can take any *aashrama*.

*Upavaasa, teertha yaatraa*, giving money in daana, tapas, and others - whoever does it in any way, that is how it is followed. And not as per *shaastraas*. So, *kaaya* *klesha* by *teertha yaatraa* is as they desire. It is not as told in the *shaastraas*, that is not dharma. Whoever does whatever becomes *dharma* in all these aspects.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Even with little bit wealth, they become arrogant that they are very wealthy. Women also become arrogant because they look good, merely through the beauty of their hair.

Whoever gives more becomes the lord. One who gives a lot of money, only becomes the master or the lord. Not necessarily one born in a good *varna*, a good *kula*, etc. Giving a lot of clothes, doing a lot of donation, one becomes the master. He only is treated as belonging to a very high class, and not one who is born in a good *kula*. Though he is of a lower *varna*, if he has a lot of money, he is treated as belonging to a higher class.

Whatever material is collected is all kept in the house, for purpose of maintaining the house only. One's intelligence is used only for earning money, and not for *aatmajnyaana*. All the money earned is only for constructing houses. All the *yaagaas, homaas*, which are performed, the money earned is not used for that purpose. Also, the money earned, used for constructing houses, maintaining, is all for one's own enjoyment, and not for treating guests, not for *atithi satkaara*.

Though even a close friend requests a lot, they do not give even a little bit. They expect a lot of personal gains only. They do not give even a half handful, and will be interested in keeping it. They do not even part with half handful of anything, and even for that, they expect a lot of personal gains, from their own friends also.
