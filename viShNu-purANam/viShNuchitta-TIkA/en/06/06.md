*Sri Paraasharar* - The *Bhagavat svaroopa* which is the object of meditation, *upaasanaa, upaasya*, was told. Now, the *upaasanaa* itself is told, with all the *angaas, upaangaas*, accessories and other things. *Svaadhyaaya* is told as the study of all the *Veda vaakyaas*, along with the *meemamsaa*, the *vichaara roopa* *meemaamsaa shaastra*, so that there is no *samshaya, viparyaya*; those *vaakyaas* which are directly telling about the *tattvaas*, the *Bhagavat svaroopa*, etc., the *Vedaanta vaakyaas* which are teaching *tattva*, the *dvaadashaakshara, pranava*, and others which teach about the *svaroopa* of *Paramaatman*, along with *meemaamsaa, poorva meemaamsaa* and *uttara meemaamsaa* is told here. This is told by the *svaadhyaaya shabda* here. *Sah* means *Purushottama*, with all the *shaadgunyaas*, the *vibhooti*, the *divya mangala vigraha*. One who has all these, the *Purushottama* is being told here by *sah*. The knowledge which arises out of *svaadhyaaya samyama*, is nothing but Brahman only. The topic, subject matter of this *svaadhyaaya* is *Brahman* only. So, it can be told as Brahman itself. This is the cause of attaining *Paramaatman*. Not only does this help to get a vivid perception of the Lord, but also one can attain Him with this.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 ***Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 6, Chapter 6, Shloka 2:  *****थवाध्यायार्ोर्मासीत * *****योर्ात् * *****थवाध्यायमावसेत् * | *****थवाध्यायायोर्संपत्त्या * *****परमात्मा * *****प्रकाशते * *****॥ * *****२ * *****॥ *   
   
Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: *****थवाध्यायत् * *****इतत * | *****समीमांसात् * *****थवाध्यायात् * *****अथं * *****पररस्च्छद्य * *****योर्मासीत * | *****र्ुणत्रयमयतेव्न * *****मनसः * *****प्रमािसंभवात् * *****अन्ययथोपासनपररहाराय * *****योर्ात् * *****थवाध्यायमावसेत् *

*Meemaamsaa shravana* is extremely important because once one does the *svaadhyaaya samskaara*, as *Vedaadhyayana* is only *akshara raashi grahana*, where meanings are known *aapaatatah*, whereas one has to understand the meanings without any doubt, without any contradictions, without *samshaya*, *viparyaya*, and these doubts will be completely destroyed through *meemaamsaa*. So *meemaamsaa shravana* is a must. Having studies the *Vedaas*, the *Poorva* *kaanda*, then *Poorva meemaamsaa* is to be studied. And then the *Uttara kaanda*, and the *Uttara meemaamsaa*, where one comes to know that there is *niratishaya* *phala praapti*, that *Parama purushaartha* can be attained. Therefore, *Uttara* *meemaamsaa adhyayana* is also to be done. One has to know clearly the meanings, what is required, what is important, and then one has to do meditation, *upaasanaa*. When one is engaged in *upaasanaa*, because of association with *prakruti*, where *sattva, rajas, tamas* have their effects, the mind can get disturbed. Such *upaasanaa* should not get disturbed, or should not become faulty. In order to avoid that, again, *svaadhyaaya* is to be done. *Svaadhyaaya, upaasanaa, svaadhyaaya, upaasanaa*, like this, one has to do. *Sri* *Engal Aalwaan* gives an example here. A child sees the *aksharaas*, and then he will write himself, and practice so that he can understand. Again he will refer to the book, and then again he will write. This is the way he learns. The *Saankhya* and other *darshanaas* by *Kapila Maharshi*, those who follow that, they resort to yoga only, and don't do *svaadhyaaya* and *yoga* both, they say that *pradhaana* is the *jagat kaarana; Vaisheshikaas* say that *paramaanu* is the *jagat kaarana*, and they don't accept *Eeshvara*. Those which are against the Shruti, are seen in the other *darshanaas*, as they resort to only yoga. Their meditation of knowledge is because they don't accept Brahman, it is *kevala yoga*, without *Paramaatman*. Whereas *Vedaanta*, those who are *Vedaantis*, those who follow the *Vedaanta* properly, they understand that for the entire world, Brahman is the creator, and  [[99]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 everything is *Brahmaatmaka*. That He is *antaryaami* in everything, He has done *anupravesha*, and done *naama roopa vyaakarana*, so everything is *Brahmaatmaka*. This *Brahmaatmaka naanaatva* is *shruti siddha*. Whereas *Brahmaatmaka* and *Abrahmaatmaka naanaatva* is *shruti nishiddha*. Everything is *Brahmaatmaka* and *Brahman* only is *jagat kaarana*. Those who follow the *shrutis*, they are able to follow it properly like this. When this becomes mature, when this fructifies, there will be a vivid perception of the Lord.

In order to see the *Paramaatman, svaadhyaaya* is also an eye. *Yoga* is said to be the *parama chakshu*, the *pradhaana chakshu*. Through *upaasanaa* only, the *saakshaatkaara* of *Paramaatman* happens. *Svaadhyaaya* is also an eye, means that it also helps us to understand the nature of *Paramaatman*. Through *upaasanaa*, one can have vivid perception of the Lord Himself. This is said to be the Supreme eye. He cannot be seen with our *maamsa chakshus*, the *praakruta* *chakshus*, material eyes.

In the meantime, *Keshidhvaja* did many many *yaagaas. Svaadhyaaya* is said to be an accessory to *upaasanaa*. Now, *yajnya* and others are also told as accessory to *upaasanaa. Braamhanaah vividishanti yajnyena daanena tapasaa ... Keshidhvaja* had *aatma jnyaana*, being a *brahmopaasana nishtha*, he performed many *yajnaas* as an accessory to that *brahmopaasana*. Why did he do all the *yajnya* and other *karmaas*? *Karma* is required to get rid of *praacheena karma* which is obstructing the rising of knowledge through *upaasanaa. Praacheena karma* which is opposed to *para vidyaa utpatti* is called *mrutyu* here. To start the *upaasanaa*, he has to get rid of the obstruction first. Through *karmaas*, he got rid of the *praacheena* *karmaas* which are obstructing the start of *upaasanaa*.

So, I will approach and ask my enemy. 



The story continues. This is a wonderful story highlighting the greatness of *Brahma vidyaa*. We will next see the rest of the story. 



We are studying Chapter 6 of *Amsha* 6. When *Maitreyar* asks *Paraasharar* to teach about the *pralayaas*, when telling about *aatyantika pralaya*, he tells about all the grief that a *jeevaatman* undergoes, and then tells about the *Bhagavat **svaroopa*. Now, he tells about what *Keshidhvaja* who was a *Brahmavit*, taught *Khaandikya Janaka*. They were both grandsons of another Janaka by name *Dharmadhvaja*. They both fight, and *Keshidhvaja* wins over the war, and *Khaandikya Janaka* goes and vanishes into the forest. *Khaandikya Janaka* is a great expert in *Karma kaanda*, and *Keshidhvaja* in *Adhyaatma shaastra*. *Keshidhvaja* is performing many *yaagaas*, while he is also doing *upaasanaa*; once while performing *pravargya yaaga*, he will have a cow from which the *havis* is collected for the *yaaga*. A tiger kills that cow, and for that, the *ritwiks* say that he has to do a *praayaschitta*, without which the *yaaga* will not be complete. *Keshidhvaja* goes and asks many sages, *Kasheru, Shunaka*, and others; none of them know the *praayaschitta* for this; and they all point him to *Khaandikya* *Janaka*, who is an expert, and only he can tell what is the *praayaschitta*. *Keshidhvaja* then decides that he will approach *Khaandikya Janaka*, in the forest, and requests him to tell the *praayaschitta* for this. Being his enemy, in case he kills him, even then he will get the fruits of the *yajnya*. If he, by chance tells him  [[104]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 what is the *praayaschitta*, then he can come and complete his *yaaga* by doing the *praayaschitta*. And then, he would have completed the *yaaga*.

If I do not kill him, then he will have the kingdom, whereas I will attain superior world.

If I win over *paraloka*, it is never-ending, it is eternal, whereas this world is only limited, and I can only rule over for a limited time.
