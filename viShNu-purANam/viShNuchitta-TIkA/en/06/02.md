*Sri Paraasharar* - In spite of so many bad things which are going to happen in *Kali **yuga*, where *dharma* is going to be destroyed, and all kinds of *adharma* will ensue, which were described, he continues about what *Vyaasar* has told about this. 



Now, he is going to tell something good about *Kali yuga*. With very little effort, one can get *punya*. In the last *shloka* of the previous *adhyaaya*, it was concluded that whatever can be achieved with great tapas in *Kruta yuga*, can be achieved with little effort in *Kali yuga*. This continues now. I am going to tell you about that, listen to it. *Paraasharar* is telling what *Vyaasar* has told.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 All the great *munis* had gathered, and were discussing about *punya vishaya*. About what is going to give us *punya*. At what time very little *dharma* will also give us great fruits, great benefits. They were discussing like this. They were also discussing about what has to be done.

In the first shloka, *Paraasharar* told about what *Vyaasar* has told to the rishis, about that very little effort within which great benefit can be gained. *Paraasharar* is continuing. All the great sages had gathered and were discussing about *punya* *vishaya*. They were discussing about what is to be done, and at what time it will happen. In order to get their doubts clarified, they approached *Mahaamuni* *Vedavyaasa*, and wanted to ask all these doubts, about the *punya vishaya* which they were discussing.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Sri Paraasharar* - Having heard them, *Vyaasa* smiled mildly and said "O great sages, do listen to me. About why I said *saadhu saadhu*". 



"You don't even know this, is also the intended meaning here". He gave the answer himself, and even though he gave the answer, the sages were not aware of that, so he was laughing, that they were not able to understand.

In *Kruta yuga*, one has to do meditation, *dhyaana*. In *Kruta yuga*, it is possible for one to achieve purity of mind by meditation only, to get any fruits. In *Tretaa yuga*, people will not have the capability to do that kind of *dhyaana*, meditation. So,  [[22]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 they can perform *yajnyaas* and can achieve the same fruits. In *Dvaapara yuga*, if one is not able to do meditation, or perform *yajnyaas*, they can just worship *Bhagavaan, archanaa, bhagavat poojaa*, and attain the same fruits. In Kali yuga, even if one is not able to do all these *dhyaana, yajnya, archanaa*, etc., mere chanting of *Bhagavaan's* auspicious names, itself, with that one can achieve all the fruits that one can achieve through *dhyaana* in *Kruta yuga*, or through *yajnyaas* in *Tretaa yuga*, or through *archanaa* in *Dvaapara yuga*. In *Kali yuga*, it is very difficult to do all these, by mere *naama sankeertana*, one can achieve all those fruits. That is why I said *Kali* is *saadhu*.

Till now, how *Kali* is *saadhu* has been told. Because, by mere *naama sankeertana*, one can achieve anything that needs to be achieved through dhy *aana, yajnya, **archanaa* in other *yugaas*. Now, *Vyaasa* explains why he said that " *shoodrah* *saadhuh*". Performing all the *vrataas*, if one has to do *Veda adhyayana*. In a proper way, they have to do *yaaga* and other things as per *vidhi*. And they have to earn money through the right way, virtuous means, and with that only, they have to perform *yajnya*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 The *Brahmins* have very strict guidance from *shaastraas* and other things, they should not be talking about unnecessary things. They cannot eat whatever they can lay their hands on. There is a lot of niyama for what they should speak, what they should not speak, what they should eat and not eat. And also for performing *yajnyaas*, there is *adhikaara*, who can perform what *yajnya*, how he has to perform, there are many conditions, *niyamaas, vrataas* for *Brahmins*. If they do not follow all of this, they will fall down from dharma. And they will be subjected to *Bhagavaan's nigraha*. They have to be always controlling the senses. They have to do all these as told in the *shaastraas*.

If they don't do properly whatever is told in the *shaastraas*, they will be subjected to punishment. For whatever they do, they have to follow the *shaastraas* and do it properly.

They have *vidhi paaratantrya* in everything that they do, depending on what is ordained in the *shaastraas*. They have to follow very strictly in every act that they do. With that only, they can go to svarga and other *lokaas* with great difficulty.

Whereas for *Shoodraas*, all these *niyamaas* are not there. These rules are there for the *traivarnikaas - Braahmanaas, Kshatriyaas* and *Vaishyaas*. Whereas for *Shoodraas*, they have to serve the other three *varnaas*. They also have to do the *yajnyaas* without *mantraas*, without *pranava*. And they can also participate in other things like cooking. Just by this only, by serving the *Brahmins*, and other *Vedaadhikaaris*, by participating in cooking and others, and performing the *mahaa yajnyaas* without *mantraas*, they can earn the *svarga* and other *lokaas*. Which other *Brahmins* can earn by strict rules and with great difficulty. *Shoodraas* can earn this very easily. *Shoodraas* can do *homa* and other things without *mantra*. This also came earlier in Vishnu *Puraana*. That is why *Shoodraas* are told to be very fortunate.

There is no niyama about what they can eat and not eat for *Shoodraas*. They can eat and drink anything they like. That is why I said that they are *saadhu*. It is very easy to earn the *punya lokaas*, just by merely serving the other classes, and also by doing *amantraka yajnya* and other things.

Now, why women are *saadhutara* is going to be told. Men have to earn whatever they want, and it should not be against their *dharma* - they have to follow dharma and earn money in the righteous ways. They have to also give it to others, and have to perform *yajnya* as ordained in the *shaastraas*. They have to do *daana* for the right person, all these *niyamaas* are there for men.

Earning money is itself very difficult as they have to earn money in the righteous way. They cannot go against what is told in the *shaastraas*. And maintaining that money is much more difficult. And how to distribute it among the deserving, is very difficult. Knowing the inner secrets of all these, the *sookshma amshaas*, is very difficult. Who is the right person for daana, how to give daana, is all difficult, as told in the *Bhagavad Geeta*. It is difficult to know the intricacies of how to perform the *daana*, how to earn money, how to maintain it, etc. But they have to follow all of this.

Following all these *niyamaas* with great difficulty, they earn all the various *lokaas*, *praajaapatya*, where they can go and enjoy later on. But it is very difficult and tough. One has to be very controlled, and careful in following all of these rules. If, at any time, they transgress the rules of the *Vedaas*, what is ordained, then they will be subjected to punishment.

With very little effort or difficulty, she will learn all those things. Whatever men learn with great difficulty. That is why I said " *Yoshitah saadhu*". 



Whatever *lokaas* men get - *Praajaapatya* and others - which men get with so much difficulty and following tough *niyamaas, vrataas* as told in the *shaastraas*, women get by merely serving them, the same thing which the husband gets.
