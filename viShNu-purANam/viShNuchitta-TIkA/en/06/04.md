Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 From *Vishnu's* face, there will be a huge forceful air which comes out, *Vaayu*, from His breath, and it blows so heavily that all the clouds will get dispersed. For more than 100 years, His breath which comes out will disperse all the huge clouds.

*Brahmaroopa dhara* was explained in *Amsha* 1 itself. *Brahma* and others do not have the *shubhaashrayatva*, only *Bhagavaan's Divya Mangala Vigraha* is called as *Shubhaashraya*.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 Those *siddhaas* who go to *Janaloka*, who cannot even stay in *Maharloka*, being eulogized by *Sanaka* and others, and those who have gone to *Satyaloka*, which is *Brahma loka*, are all meditating upon the *Brahmaroopa dhara*. Being meditated upon by those who desire to get liberated, *Vishnu* who has taken the form of *Chaturmukha Brahma* is sleeping on *Aadishesha*. 



How is this possible, is explained in the Commentary. *Chaturmukha Brahma* and others do not have *shubhaashrayatva* as they are all *karma vashyaas*, being born here. How can *mumukshus*, those who desire liberation, meditate upon this *Chaturmukha Brahma*, is explained here. In *yoga*, we have *dhaarana, dhyaana* and *samaadhi*. The object to be meditated upon is to be firmly fixed in the mind. This *dhaarana* has to be done. In order to achieve this *dhaarana, shubhaashraya* was told. But, those who attain the *samaadhi* state after *dhaarana*, for them, meditating upon *Bhagavaan* who is in the form of the whole world, is not against the *Shrutis*. This is also possible, they can meditate upon Him like this. *Prahlaada* was meditating like this, he was meditating upon himself as *Bhagavaan*, and that everything is created by him only. This is called *Ahamgrahopaasane*, where they meditate upon the *Brahma, aatman* who is the inner self. So, *aham* goes up to the inner self, who is the *Paramaatman*, who is actually the one who is told by every word. So, *aham* goes up to that, this is called as *Aparyavasaanavrutti. Aham* extends up to the *antaryaami Paramaatman*. This is *shareera vishishta*, *jeevaatma vishishta Paramaatman*. They meditate upon the *Paramaatman* who is the inner self of the self. This is not against what is told in the *Shrutis*. When someone meditates upon *Parashuraama, Kalki*, there is *anupravesha* of *Paramaatman* in them, for some time, they are not *Poornaavataara*, but *anupravesha avataaraas*. Whenever *Bhagavaan* enters into them for some particular time, to achieve extraordinary things, at that time, they are *Paramaatma avataara*, it is not a *Poornaavataara*, but *anupravesha avataara*. He does all His exceptional acts during that time. At that time, He is meditated upon like that by *mumukshus*.

When the *gandha tanmaatra* is merged into its cause, then the whole worlds will become waters. They will be making huge sound, noise, and the complete world will be filled with waters. 



The *pralaya* is the reverse order of creation. The order of creation is from *ahamkaara*, the *sattva, rajas, tamas*, the *taamasa ahamkaara* with *raajasa **ahamkaara*, the *shabda tanmaatra* is created. From *shabda tanmaatra, aakaasha **tattva* is created. From *aakaasha*, it is *sparsha tanmaatra*, and then *vaayu tattva*. Then *roopa tanmaatra*, then *tejas*, then *rasa tanmaatra*, then *ap*, then *gandha* *tanmaatra* and *pruthivi*. The reverse order is *pruthivi - gandha tanmaatra - ap - **rasa tanmaatra*, ... the reverse order. 



The *gandha tanmaatra*, the modifications of *pruthivi* which we see here, this is also included here.

Wind will be blowing making a huge noise. When the fire is put off, the fire *tattva*, *Agni tattva* is destroyed, and there will be no light in all the worlds, when *tejas* reaches the state of *vaayu*. 



*Ajyoti* is a state of *vaayu* itself. Opposed to fire.

*Aakaasha* will make the *vaayu's guna*, which is *sparsha*, to go. The *sparsha* *tanmaatra* will go and merge in *aakaasha*, which is actually the cause. *Vaayu* will give up its *guna, sparsha. Vaayu* will reach the state of *sparsha tanmaatra*, and it will reach the *aakaasha tattva*. Then only *aakaasha* will be there.

The *shabda tanmaatra* will get merged into *bhootaadi. Bhootaadi* is the creator of *Pancha bhootaas*, which is *taamasa ahamkaara*. Along with all the *bhootendriyaas*, it goes and merges. By *bhootaadi* here, the *trividha ahamkaara* is meant, as *indriyaas* are also getting merged. From *saatvika ahamkaara, indriyaas* are created. From *taamasa ahamkaara, tanmaatraas* and *pancha bhootaas* are created. All these get merged in the reverse order during *pralaya*. Only *ahamkaara tattva* will be there. 



*Shabda tanmaatra* will go and get merged in *bhootaadi. Indriyaas* are also merging in the *ahamkaara tattva*.

The cause of all the *pancha bhootaas* is said to be *taamasa ahamkaara*. The *ahamkaara* also goes in the *mahat tattva*. Which is also told as *buddhi*. 



After this, the *pralaya* description continues, where it is going into *moola prakruti*. There is a further description of *praakruta pralaya*. We have seen up to the *mahat* *tattva*, how the *pralaya* happens in reverse order. The *abhimaanaa* which  [[49]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 comes, *aham aham*, which is the feeling of I, I, *ahamkaara* is responsible for that. This is *bhootaadi*, which is the cause of the *tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. This is known as *taamasa ahamkaara. Bhootaadi* goes and merges into *mahaan, mahat*, which is also *buddhi*. 



All the manifest things get merged into the *pruthivi tattva. Pruthivi tattva* merges into the *gandha tanmaatra*. This goes and merges into *ap tattva*, which merges into *rasa tanmaatra*. This goes and merges into *tejas*, which merges into *roopa **tanmaatra*, which merges into *vaayu tattva*. This merges into *sparsha tanmaatra*, which merges into *aakaasha*, which merges into *shabda tanmaatra*. Which merges into *ahamkaara tattva*. *Indriyaas* also merge into *ahamkaara tattva*. The three *ahamkaara tattvaas* merge into *mahat tattva*, which is also told as buddhi. This merges into the *moola* *prakruti*, which we see next. 



We are studying Chapter 4 of *Amsha* 6. Where *Sri Paraasharar* is describing the nature of *Naimittika pralaya* and *Praakruta pralaya*. In the *Praakruta pralaya*, everything happens in the reverse order of creation. In creation, the order is *prakruti, mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. In the reverse order, everything merges in its respective cause. In this, how the *bhootaadi*, the cause of the *bhootaas*, which is *taamasa ahamkaara*, which goes and merges into the *mahat tattva*, is told. This *ahamkaara* is a tattva, a *dravya*. This goes and merges in *mahat*, which is also known as *buddhi*, as it influences the mind while making decisions. In some *darshanaas*, it is taken as an *antahkarana* also.

This shloka is about the *laya* of all the *sapta aavaranaas*, around the *pruthivi*. From *mahat, ahamkaara*, and seven *tanmaatraas* - these seven are known as *sapta prakrutayah*. They have both *prakruti* and *vikruti*, but they are known as *prakrutis*. They are the causes of the following *tattvaas*. All these, in the reverse order, during dissolution, go and merge into their causes. The *tanmaatraas* go and merge into *ahamkaara*, then into *mahat*. They go and merge into their respective causes in the same order.

During *pralaya*, in the *moola* *prakruti*, the *sattva, rajas, tamas* are all in equal proportion. When there is any disturbance in that proportion, one of them becomes more or less, immediately, at that time and place, creation starts. Moola *prakruti* is like a huge ocean, and in that, in some parts, the sattva, rajas, tamas get imbalanced; immediately, at that place, one *Brahmaanda* is created, and creation starts - *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhootaas*. So, these are like the waves in a huge ocean. *Brahmaandaas* are getting created and dissolved. When there is *guna saamya*, then pralaya happens. When there is a *guna vaishamya*, creation happens. When the *gunaas* are equal, when nothing is less or more, the *pradhaana* which is the *moola prakruti*, which is the cause of all the *praakruta* substances.

This *prakruti* which is having *vyakta* \(the manifest part, which is having name and form, what we see in this world, the millions of things we see around\) and *avyakta* \(the *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, pancha bhoota tattvaas*\), all of them will go and merge in *avyakta*. 



How can *vyakta avasthaa* go and merge in *avyakta*? Normally, something goes and merges in its cause only. So, can *vyakta* be an effect of the *avyakta*? Yes, because it is all *praakruta*, it is the same substance. Everything that we see in this world has name and form, is all *praakruta*, it is all *prakruti parinaama, avyakta **parinaama*. Everything is having *sattva, rajas, tamas*, these three qualities, which are there in *moola prakruti*. Everything is *prakruti dravya* only, but they are getting modified every moment and present in various states. Same *prakruti **dravya* goes into a different state, called *mahat*, then it changes into another state called *ahamkaara*. The *dravya* is same, it is not a new substance which is created. Everything is *trigunaatmaka prakruti* only. Even the *avyakta avasthaa* is *prakruti dravya* only. Therefore, *vyakta* goes and merges into *avyakta*.

This tells about the sentient part, the *chetanaas. Chetana* does not undergo modification in his essential nature. He is not told like *prakruti* which gets modified into many forms. There is no *vaichitrya*. All are *jnyaana aananda* *svaroopaas* only. In *svaroopa*, there is no difference among all the sentients. Because the differences and multitude happens because of the sattva and other *gunaas* only. Which is absent in the *chetana*. He is not *trigunaatmaka*, he is consciousness, *jnyaana svaroopa*. Though there are many *chetanaas*, they are not like *prakruti*, where *svaroopa* itself gets modified, and it is present in different states. That is why he is called as *eka, akshara, nitya* - all are similar in *svaroopa*. 



He is *sarvavyaapee*. How is he told as *sarvavyaapee*? Because he can enter into minutest form of *prakruti* also. He is very *sookshma*. He is very subtle. This is told as anu also in *shaastraas*; but *anu* is more a material measure, which cannot be used for a spiritual entity, which is *jeevaatman*. The meaning is *sookshma*. He is so subtle that he can enter into *prakruti* in any state. He can pervade into *prakruti* also, because he is so *sookshma*. He is also *Paramaatman's amsha* only, just as *prakruti* is *Paramaatman's amsha. Amsha* means part, which means that He is *visheshana amsha. Prakruti* and *Purusha* are *shareera* of *Paramaatman*. That is why there are *visheshana amsha*, and *visheshya amsha*. 



The *laya sthaana* is told as *prakruti* here, and incidentally the *Purusha* and *Paramaatman* are going to be told. 



*Chetana* is also an *amsha* of *Paramaatman* only. 



Next, *Paramaatman svaroopa* is going to be told.

*Sarvesha* is the ruler of everything, He is the Supreme Ruler. He does not have name and class, these kind of differences, divisions, etc. He is known as *sattaa* only. 



*Paramaatman* is *niravayavi*, and how can there be a part in *Paramaatman*? Can we break into parts? Where one part becomes *chetana, achetana*, etc. It is not like this. It is not *Paramaatman ekadravyatva*. It is through *shareera shareeri* *bhaava* only - the *visheshana amsha*, and *visheshya amsha*. And it is inseparably associated as attribute, both the *Purusha* and *Prakruti*. They are supported by Him, they are controlled by Him, and meant for His purpose only, all the time. They can never exist independently by themselves. Just because *amsha* is told, it does not mean that it is *dravya* only, but it is *Bhagavadaatmaka*.

Many *pramaanaas* are told. He is without any defects. He is far from any defects. *Prakruti* has the defect of undergoing modification in its essential nature, *jeevaatman* has the defect of undergoing modification in his attributive nature. Whereas *Paramaatman* does not have any defect. So, He cannot be the same material. He is beyond all the modifications of *prakruti*. The *indriyaas, deha*, are all *Bhagavadaatmaka*; He is the inner self of everything. It is said to be shakti for Him, *shakti, amsha, kaaya, vapu, tanu, roopa* denote *shareera. Shareera shareeri **bhaava* is told. It is told clearly that there are all many *nitya chetanaas*, but there is one who is different and distinct from all these, who bestows everything for them. Having known and meditated upon, the impeller who is *Paramaatman*, and the *jeevaatman* are different; then only he will attain Him. *Purushottama* is different, not the same as *Prakruti* and *Purusha*. He is very different and distinct from *Prakruti* and *Purusha*. There are many Shruti *pramaanaas, Smruti* *pramaanaas* which tell this.

How can we say *amshatva*, how can we say *amsha*. He is very different and distinct from everything else. How can we say that *jeevaatman* and *prakruti* are *amsha* of *Paramaatman? Sootrakaara* says by *shareera shareeri bhaava*, by giving different examples, *prakaasha, jaati, guna, deha. Prakaasha* is *prabhaa* and *prabhaavat, prabhaavat* is the source of light, and *prabhaa* is the light which comes out; they are different. The light spreads everywhere in brightness, whereas the source is in one place. The light is also *prakaasha*, its *prabhaa* is also *prakaasha*. Both the light and its brightness are light only, but they are different substances, the attribute moves away from it, though it is inseparably associated, and the other, the substance stays there. They are said to be parts, though they are different. Similarly, *jaati*, class. *Jaati* resides in a *vyakti*, a person. *Manushya*, *manushyatva jaati* is there in a person, like *Devadatta*. If we say that *Devadatta* is a man, then *manushyatva* is there in *Devadatta*. It is different, but is inseparably associated. *Jaati* is the attribute of the *vyakti. Guna guni* - the quality and the substance which has that quality. Similarly, *deha* and *aatman*, the body and soul. In the same way, both *prakruti* and *Purusha* are present as His *shareera*. When we say *Devadatta*, we mean *Devadatta* with the *manushyatva jaati* included, though the *jaati* is different from the person. The person itself is not *manushyatva*, and *manushyatva* is itself not the person. They are two different things, but present as person, substance and attribute. But they are told as one entity, when we say *Devadatta*, both are included. In the same with *Paramaatman*, one body, told with *amshaas*. This is the way that *Baadaraayana, Krishna Dvaipaayana* has told in the *Brahma Sootraas*. This is told as " *Amsho naanaa vyapadeshaat*". *Brahma **Sootraa* s explain how *prakruti* and *Purusha* are part of the *Paramaatman*. They are called by the name *amsha* as they are *shareera* to *Paramaatman. Shareera* does not mean having hands and legs, eyes, etc. but it is by means of the three kinds of relationship, it is *aadhaara-aadheya bhaava, niyaamaka-niyaamya **bhaava, shesha-sheshi bhaava*, these three. These are called as *shareera shareeri*. That which is *aadhaara, niyaamaka* and *sheshi*, is *shareeri*. That which is *aadheya* \(supported\), *niyaamya* \(controlled\), *shesha* \(subservient\) is called as *shareera*.

*Paramaatman* does not have any *vikaaraas*, does not mean that He does not have any attributes. But, He does not undergo any modifications, is the meaning here.  [[55]] of 194 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 He is that to be known. It is told clearly that " *Yasya aatmaa shareeram*". Because He is told as " *Yah pruthivyaam tishthan, yasya pruthivee shareeram, yah tejasi **tishthan, yasya tejah shareeram, ..., yah aatmani tishthan, yasya aatmaa **shareeram*". The non-sentient and sentient are both said to be *shareera* to *Paramaatman. Aatma* and *prakruti* are told to be *shareera* to *Paramaatman*. The word *aatma* shows that the varieties of *aatma* are included. There are three kinds of *aatmans, baddha, mukta, nitya*. He is different and distinct from all because all are His *shareera*.

*Jeevaatman* also gets a body, but it is due to his *karmaas*. He has to experience the fruits of the *karma, sukha, dukha*, the *phalaas* which have accrued through the *punya* and *paapa roopa karmaas* which he has done from *anaadi kaala*. He has to experience the fruits of all that. He gets a body because of *karma. Karma* is the *kaarana* for that. But, *Paramaatman's shareera* is not like that. *Prakruti* and *Purusha* are naturally *shareera* to Him. He has not got it because of *karma*. 



*Prabhaa* and *prabhaavat* are naturally associated. If the source is not there, then *prabhaa* will not be there. Similar to this, the *jagat* and *Brahman, shareera* *shareeri bhaava* is natural. It is not because of *karma*. There are many *pramaanaas* told. This is how *Paramaatma svaroopa* is explained.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 *Subaalopanishad* says that *avyakta* merges into *akshara*, here merging means that they stay together and cannot be differentiated that this is *avyakta*, this is *akshara*. They are merging in such a way. They are staying together, but they don't lose their essential nature. There is no *svaroopa naasha* in this *laya*. They will be in such a subtle state. That *akshara* which also has *avyakta*, goes and merges into *tamas*. It becomes a substance called *tamas. Tamas* stays in *ekee **bhaava*, the *tamas* which is a *dravya* which contains *avyakta* and *akshara*, goes and unites into *Paramaatman*, as though it is one with *Paramaatman*, cannot be differentiated. It will be in such a very very subtle state. 



The manifest and unmanifest of *Prakruti*, which have merged into the *avyakta*, moola *prakruti*, and the *Purusha*, the collectivity of all sentients, both go and unite into *Paramaatman*. This is *pralaya*.

In the *poorva kaanda* of the *Vedaas*, the *Samhitaa, Braahmana, Aranyakaas*, where *yajnya yaagaas* are all told primarily, and *Paramaatma svaroopa* is also told, but not very directly. Upanishads focus mainly on *Paramaatma svaroopa*, *aatma svaroopa*, directly and completely; this is said to be *Vedaanta. Veda* and *Vedaanta* both are known as *Vishnu*, who is none other than *Paramaatma*, Supreme Self. He is support of everything, and is Supreme Lord, Supreme Ruler, known by the name *Vishnu*. In *Vedaas*, He is known as Vishnu, and by other names also. Even *Agni, Varuna, Indra* all names stand for *Paramaatman* only in the *poorva kaanda*. This is told so in *Yaaska's Nirukta*. In *Vedaanta*, it is told by the names of *Tat, aatmaa, Brahma, aakaasha, jyoti*, used synonymously.

Sri Vishnu Puraanam – Amsha 6 The *Vaidika karmaas*, everything told in the *Ve* d *aas, yajnya, yaagaas, nitya **naimittika karmaas*, can be divided into two, as *pravrutta* and *nivrutta*. Both these *pravrutti karma* and *nivrutti karma; pravrutti karma* for *aihika* and *aamushmika* *phalaas*, fruits obtained here itself, or svarga or other kinds of fruits, various *yajnyaas, yaagaas*; and those who have the *Vedaantic* knowledge, worship *Paramaatman* only, who is inner self of everything, and this is the *nivrutti **maarga*, they are not interested in these fruits, but they want liberation, the ultimate goal. Both are told in the *Vedaas*. Both of them worship only *Vishnu*, who is having everything as His *shareera*, and is only present as everything, as the inner self of everything. He is *sarvaantaryaami*, He is only worshipped by all these. 



Because He is *Sarvamoorthi*, present as inner self of all, everything, even gods, those who worship *Indra* and other *devataas*, also worship *Vishnu* only, as He is only *Sarvamoorthi*. He is present as inner self of Indra and other *devataas*.

Those who are not interested in the fruits which are not permanent, they take up the *nivrutti maarga*, and they worship as *Jnyaanaatmaa, jnyaana svaroopa*, whose *divya mangala vigraha* is said to be *jnyaanaatmika*, one who has the *divya* *mangala vigraha* which is *jnyaanaatmika* is *Jnyaanamoorti*, is worshipped through *jnyaana yoga. Karma* which has *jnyaana yoga* as the main part, He is worshipped by that. But *nivrutti maarga* one who worships Him, he gets *moksha*.

He is only present in all these forms, He is only the inner self of everything. Everything is His *shareera*. All are His modes. In *avyakta*, He is the *kaarana avasthaa*. He is *avyakta shareeraka **Paramaatman*, in the causal state. He is the *vyakta shareeraka Paramaatman*, in the state of effect. He is the *mukta* also. *Avyakta, vyakta, mukta* are all *Vishnu* *roopa* only. They are all having *Bhagavaan Vishnu* only as their inner self, and they are all the *shareera*.

*Vyakta prakruti* goes and merges into *Purusha*, and they are all going and uniting with *Paramaatman*. One night of *Paramaatman* which is also *dviparaardha kaala*, equivalent to 100 years of *Chaturmukha Brahma*, is one day, and one night also for *Paramaatman*. One night period, they all will be united into *Paramaatman*. 



Why is it again told - *vyakta prakruti, laya* with *Purusha*? In order to tell about *nishaa*, night, which is also the same time period. At that time, the *vyakta* and *avyakta* will be united into *Paramaatman*.

*Paramaatma svaroopa* is *nitya* means, all the *jeevaatmans* are also *nitya* only. *Chaturmukha Brahma* and their *svaroopa* is also *nitya* only. So for *Paramaatman*, *nitya* here is to be taken as *divya mangala vigraha nityatva*. He has an eternal divine auspicious form, *divya mangala vigraha. Sadaikarooparoopaaya - roopa* is told two times. 



Day and night are not there for *Paramaatman*. It is only told in *oupachaarika* sense, secondary sense.

Now, I have told you the *praakruta laya*. When 100 years are over for *Chaturmukha Brahma*, including *Chaturmukha Brahma* the entire *prakruti* *mandala*, everything goes and merges into *Paramaatman*. The *chetanaas*, *avyakta*, everything goes and unites with *Paramaatman*, stays as though they are one with *Paramaatman*, and this is the *kaarana avasthaa*. Again, when He creates, these will all come into the manifest state, *srushti*. I have told you about the *praakruta pralaya*. Now, I will tell you about the *aatyantika laya*, which is moksha. Do listen. 



This completes Chapter Four.
