All the *mlecchaas*, *dasyus*, who are engaged in bad conduct, being endowed with unlimited powers, He will destroy all of them. He will establish all the people in their proper *dharmaas. Kaliyuga* will end with the incarnation of *Mahaavishnu* as *Kalki* in the house of *Vishnuyashas*, who is the chief *Brahmin* of *Shambala graama*. He will destroy all the people engaged in bad conduct who are not following *Shrouta Smaarta **dharmaas*. He will establish *dharma* completely in this world.

How the next *yuga* will start from here, will be told. We are studying Chapter 24 of *Amsha* 4. It was told how the dharma declines steadily in the Kali yuga, and at the end of *Kali yuga*, the *Kalki **avataara* will start. *Bhagavaan Vishnu* incarnates as *Kalki*, in the house of a *Brahmin* by name *Vishnuyashas*. He will destroy all evil forces, and establish all people in their *varna* and *aashrama dharmaas*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 99: अन�रं च अशेषः कलेः अवसाने िनशावसाने िवबु�ानाम् इव तेषाम् एव जनपदानाम् अमल �िटक दल शु�ा मतयो भिव��� ॥ ९९ ॥ When *Kalki avataara* happens, and he establishes all people in their *varna* and *aashrama dharmaas*, the *Kali yuga* ends completely, as though at the end of night, when people wake up in the morning, for the same people, their minds will become so pure and clear just like the *sphatika shilaa*, without any dirt or defects. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 100:  तेषां च बीज भूतानाम् अशेष मनु�ाणां प�रणतानाम् अिप तत् काल कृत अप�प्रसूितः भिव�ित ॥ १०० ॥ The same people, though they may not be in the best state for having children, they will have children according to those times, meaning that only *dharmishthaas* will be born. People who are there at the end of this Kaliyuga, when *Bhagavaan* establishes their varna *aashrama dharmaas*, they only will have children as per those times.  [[235]] of 249

When they come together, in the *Pushya nakshatra*, when all are in the same *raashi*, that is when the *Kruta yuga* starts.

At the end of the *chaturyuga*, all the *grahaas* will be in the same position. When all the *grahaas* are in the same *nakshatra* and *raashi* only, the *yuga* starts. Or, it can also be interpreted as only these four *grahaas* are taken, and this is *graha baahulya* - these are the prominent planets which are to be in one position. This is explained in *Bruhat* *Jaataka* of *Varaahamihira, Chandra, Arka, Jeeva, Jnya, Sita, Kuja, Arki* - Moon, Sun *, Bruhaspati, Budha, Shukra, Angaaraka, Shani* are mentioned here - they have to be together. *Chandra, Arka, Jeeva* are said to be *Sattva samjnyaas*, indicating *Sattva. Jnya* and *Sita* indicate Rajas. Kuja and *Arki* are *Tamas*. Every 12 years, in *Karkataka maasa, Amaavaasyaa*, they all go in the same star, that is why the *raashi* is also mentioned, that they should be in the same *raashi*. This indicates the time when *Kruta* yuga starts. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 103:  अतीता वत�मानाः च तथा एव अनागताः च ये |  [[236]] of 249

Vaayu Puraana also tells the same thing - 1500 years, from *Pareekshit* to the last Nanda king. Starting with *Nanda* himself, this *Kali kaala* starts, when the *Saptarshis* reach *Poorvaashaada nakshatra*, then adharma will increase. The Kshatriya kula will decline. *Kali's* period is fixed, but the adharma will increase. This shloka tells that the *Kali* will increase, does not mean the duration, but the increase of *adharma*.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 कथमेष नरे�ाणां मोहो बु��मताम् अिप | येन फेनसधमा�णो अिप अित िव�� चेतसः ॥ १२८ ॥ *Pruthivi* told - Though they are very intelligent, how can they have this kind of a delusion, *moha*, about owning this land. They are equivalent to a bubble in an ocean. They just come and go, are so short lived. They seem to be very confident about what they are thinking. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 129: पूव�म् आ�जयं कृ�ा जेतुम् इ��� म��णः | ततो भृ�ां च पौरां� िजगीष�े तथा �रपून् ॥ १२९ ॥ First, they want to win over themselves, then they want to win over their ministers and servants, and all the people and enemies. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 130: क्रमेण अनेन जे�ामो वयं पृ�ी ं ससागराम् | इित आस�िधयो मृ�ुं न प��� अिवदूरगम् ॥ १३० ॥ Slowly, let us win over the entire world, along with the oceans. Like this, they are all the time interested in winning over the land, and they don't see death which is not very far off. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 131: समुद्रावरणं याित भूम�लमथो वशम् | िकयत् आ�जय� एतत् मु��ः आ�जये फलम् ॥ १३१ ॥ They go till the end of the ocean, and they occupy the entire earth *bhoo **mandala*, and what is this compared to the *indriya jaya*, which will actually lead to *mukti*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: रा� मु�ोः इ��य जय सा��े िकं मु��ं िह�ा अ�ेन रा�ेन इित आह समुद्रेित | Winning over the kingdom, establishing themselves, and winning over their own senses - these two cannot be compared. Winning over the senses will lead them to liberation itself. Winning over the land is so meagre. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 132:  उ�ृ� पूव�जा याता यां नदाय गतः िपता | तां ममतेवीव मूढ�ात् जेतुम् इ��� पािथ�वाः ॥ १३२ ॥ Their forefathers, the kings, when they passed away, they did not take the land. Their father did not take it along with him. *Pruthivi* is telling -  [[243]] of 249

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 "They did not take me". They all passed away without taking me. Out of stupidity, they are trying to win over. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: उ�ृ� इित | यां भुवं उ�ृ� न आदाय एव, िपतामहा�ा याताः िपता च गतः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 133: म�ृते िपतृपुताणां भ्रातॄणां चािप िवग्रहः | जयते अ�� मोहेन मम�ात् ध्रुतचेतसाम् ॥ १३३ ॥ There will be difference of opinion, fights, among father and son, among brothers, in order to win over the land. Thinking that this is mine, the idea of possession is what is leading to all this. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 134: पृ�ी ममेयं सकला ममैषा मद�य� अिप च शा�तीयम् | यो यो मृतो िह अत्र बभूव राजा कुबु��रासीत् इित त� त� ॥ १३४ ॥ Regarding earth, one king says "This is mine". Another king says "This is mine". "This belongs to my descendants forever". Whoever has died and passed away, all those people had this evil thought. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पृ्वी इित | पृ�ी मम इयम् इित िभ�व�ृवा�भङ्�ः | तत्र भूः एषा मम् इित एकः | उयं मम इित अ�ः | अपरो मम इयं शा�ती इित वदन् एव यो यो राजा मृतो लोका�रे जातः , त� त� अिप इह प्रा�रणात् इयं भूः मम इित बु��ः आसीत् | मृते अ�त्रे पाठे , अ�त्र प्राचीन राि� मृते अथ अ�ो यो बभूव राजा त� अिप एवं दुबु���ः आसीत् | Before dying, they all thought that this belongs to me only. Every king thought like this. Every king had the same thought that this belongs to them. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 135:  �ष्�ा मम�ात् धृतिच�मेकं िवहाय मां मृ�ुवशं व्रज�म् | त�ानु यः त� कथं मम�ं ��ा�दं म�भवं करोित ॥ १३५ ॥ One king thought that this land belonged to him only. When he passed away, having seen him also, even then, people are not realizing. When he died leaving me here, one who follows him, how can he again have the idea of possession in him, that this belongs to him, even having seen a king who passed away without taking anything. Thus says *Pruthivi*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[244]] of 249

He says to his enemies - "Leave this land and go - this belongs to me only, this is mine". At the same time, they are such stupid idiotic people, that I have pity for them. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पृिथवी इित | इित एवं मम� का�रषु मम अितहासो भवित, दया या�ुपैित मािमित शेषः | दयामुपैमीित वा पाठः | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 137: श्री पराशरः - इित एते धरणी गीताः �ोक मैत्रेय यैः श्रुताः | मम�ं िवलयं याित तपित अक� यथा िहमम् ॥ १३७ ॥ *Sri Paraasharar* - What is the *phala* for those who listen to this, understand that they will not have any *mamakaara*. Whoever listens these *shlokaas* told by *Pruthivi*, for them, the *mamatva* will go away. Just as the ice melts away in the burning Sun. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 138: इित एष किथतः स�क् मनोः वंशो मया तव | यत्र �स्थितप्रवृ�� िव�ोः अंशांशका नृपाः ॥ १३८ ॥ Like this, I have told you the *Manu vamsha*. All these are *Vishnu's Amsha*.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 This *vamsha charita* of *Shashi* and *Soorya* - the *Chandra vamsha* and *Soorya vamsha*, listening to all these with controlled senses, and with great devotion, they will get all the prosperity - *dhana, dhaanya*, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 141: इ�ाकु जह्नु मा�ातृ सगरािवि�तान् रघून् | ययाित न�षा�ां च �ा�ा िन�ाम् उपागतान् ॥ १४१ ॥ When they all passed away - *Ikshvaaku, Jahnu, Maandhaatru, Sagara, **Avikshita, Raghu, Yayaati, Nahusha* and others - knowing that they were all there, and they passed away ... Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: इ�ाकु इित | िन�ाम् नाशम् | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 142: महाबलान् महावीया�न् अन� धन स�यान् | कृतान् कालेन बिलना कथाशेषान् नरािधपान् ॥ १४२ ॥ ... they were all very powerful people, they were very valiant, very strong, they had collected endless money, all these kings, only their story is remaining now. As time passed away, they all passed away, and only their story remains. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 143: श्रु�ा न पुत्र दारादौ गृह�ेत्रािदके तथा | द्र�ादौ वा कृतप्र�ो मम�ं कु�ते नरः ॥ १४३ ॥ If one listens to this, then they will not have the idea of possession, idea of "mine" in son, wife, house, land, wealth - they will not have the idea of possession. They will get the idea of non possession in all of these. They will be detached. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 144: त�ं तपो यैः पु�षप्रवीरैः उ�ा�िभः वष�गणान् अनेकान् | इष्�ा सुय�ैः बिलनो अितवीया�ः कृता नु कालेन कथावशेषाः ॥ १४४ ॥ All these great people have performed tapas for many many years, raising both their hands for thousands of years. They performed lots of good *yajnyaas*, they became very powerful and strong, but as time passed by, they all passed away, and only their name is remaining here. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 145:  पृथुः सम�ान् िवचचार लोकान् अ�ाहतो यो िविजता�रचक्रः | स कालवातािभहतः प्रण�ः ि��ं यथा शा�िलतूलम�ौ ॥ १४५ ॥  [[246]] of 249

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 *Pruthu* went around the entire world, and unstopped, won over all his enemies. He was hit by the wind of *kaala*, time, and he was also destroyed. As though the cotton is thrown into fire, and it burns. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 146: यः कात�वीय� बुभुजे सम�ान् दीपान् समाक्र� हता�रचक्रः | कथा प्रस�ेषु अिभधीयमानः स एव संक� िवक� हेतुः ॥ १४६ ॥ As *Kaartaveeryaarjuna* who was a great king, enjoyed all the continents, he occupied the whole earth and won over all his enemies; when someone is telling about his story, then they will get a doubt whether he was really there or not. Because he is no more now, and only his story is remaining. People get a doubt whether he was really there or not. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: य इित | संक� िवक� हेतुः संक�� मनसः िवक�ः संशयः , त� हेतुः िकम् एवम् िवधः काि�त् आसीत् न वा इित संशय� िनिम�म् | They get a doubt in their mind. Is it possible for someone to be like this. Was he really there or not? That is the state now.

Even their ash is not remaining now. Yama, just by the raising of his eyebrows, they all got destroyed. Not even their ash is remaining now. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: दशानन इित | भ�ािप कथं न जातं कथं न ित�ित | यत् वा तेषाम् ऐ�य� िन�ेषद��ात् भ�ावस्थम् अिप न जातम् | इदम् कथम् इित आ�य� | How is it possible?

Only his story is remaining now. He is also gone. Having listened to this, how can, in their own self, think that this belongs to me. They are all dull minded ones.

Means that they have *deha aatma* *bhramaa*. They think that the body itself is *aatman*. Even in their body they cannot think that this is mine. How can they think in their land, house, family, son, etc. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 24, Shloka 149: भगीरथा�ाः सगरः ककु�थो दशाननो राघवल�णौ च | युिधि�रा�ाः च बभूवुः एते स�ं न िम�ा � नु ते न िव�ः ॥ १४९ ॥ *Bhageeratha* and others, *Sagara, Kakutstha, Dashaanana, Raaghava, **Lakshmana, Yudhishthira* - is it true or false, we do not know whether they were there.

When he cannot make in his own body, how can he think of *mamatva* in his own wife or land, or even in other people who are having embodied souls. How can he say that they are his friends or his relatives? How can one have the idea of possession, how can one have such a thought?
