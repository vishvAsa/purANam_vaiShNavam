www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 अतः परं ययातेः प्रथम पुत्र� यदोः वंशम् अहं कथयािम ॥ १ ॥ *Sri Paraasharar - Yayaati's* first son *Yadu*, his *vamsha*, I will tell you, *Yadu* *vamsha*.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 2: यत्र अशेष लोक िनवासो मनु� िस� गंधव� य� रा�स गु�क िकंपु�ष अ�र उरग िवहग दै� दानव आिद� �द्र वसु अि� म�त् देविष�िभः मुमु�ुिभः धम� अथ� काम मो�ािथ�िभः च तत् तत् फल लाभाय सदा अिभष्टुतो अप�र�े� माहा� अंशेन भगवान् अनािद िनधनः िव�ुः अवततार ॥ २ ॥ This tells about *Krishna avataara*, this is just a mention here, later on it will come in detail. In this *Yadu Vamsha*, He who has all the worlds as His place of living, all these beings - *manushya, siddha, gandharva, yaksha, **raakshasa, guhyaka, kimpurusha, apsara, uraga, vihaga, daitya, daanava, **aaditya, rudra, vasu, ashvi, devarshi*, and also those desirous of other *purushaarthaas*, *dharma, artha, kaama, moksha*, in order that they can attain their desired fruits, depending on their desires, One who is always being eulogized, Who has unbounded, boundless excellence, Vishnu who does not have beginning to end, who is the Supreme Lord *Bhagavaan*, who is endowed with *Shaadgunya, Vishnu* manifested in this *vamsha*.* * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: यदुवंश� सव� औ�ृष्�म् आह - यत्र इित | यत्र यदोः वंशे, मुमु�ुिभः केवल मो�ािथ�िभ अंशेन लीला गृहीत प�र��� मूित� �विहत�ात् अंश इित �पदेशेन ��पेण | अत एव परं ब्र� नर आकृित इित अिभिहतम् | *Yaduvamsha* is the most excellent among all the *vamshaas*, those who are desirous of only moksha, and also those who are desirous of *dharma*, *artha*, *kaama*, and then moksha - why is it told as *amshena*, where *amsha* means only a part, as *Krishna* is a *poornaavataara*, it is just His sport, He manifested, it is His *leelaa*, and because it was limited by just a human form, we could all see Him just like a human, His *svaroopa* can be called as *sakala manuja nayana vishayataam gatah*, He had a bound form like a human being, but that was His *svaroopa*, that is why it is called as *amsha* here. He was in His own nature.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 3: अत्र �ोकः ॥ ३ ॥ This is praised in a *shloka*.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 4:  यदोः वंश नरः श्रु�ा सव� पापैः प्रमु�ते | यत्र अवतीण� कृ�ा�ं परं ब्र� नराकृित ॥ ४ ॥  [[131]] of 249

That *Raavana*, came and tried to attack him, *Kaartaveeryaarjuna* caught him just like an animal, and puts him in solitary confinement in his kingdom. *Kaartaveeryaarjuna* was so powerful.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 20: यः च प� अशीत् वष� सहस्र उपल�ण काल अवसाने भगवन् नारायण अंशेन परशुरामेण उपसं�तः ॥ २० ॥ He ruled for 85000 years, and at the end of that time, he was killed by *Parashuraama*, who is *Bhagavat* *amsha*.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 11, Shloka 21: त� च पुत्र शत प्रधानाः प� पुत्राः बभूवुः शूर शूरसेन वृषसेन मधु जय�ज सं�ाः ॥ २१ ॥ He had 100 sons, out of them 5 were prominent, *Shoora, Shoorasena, **Vrushasena, Madhu, Jayadhvaja*.
