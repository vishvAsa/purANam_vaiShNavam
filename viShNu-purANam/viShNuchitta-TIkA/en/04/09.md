Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 3: भगवन् अ�ाकम् अत्र िवरोधे कतमः प�ो जेता भिव�ित इित ॥ ३ ॥ When we are going to fight, O Lord, which side is going to win? * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 4: अथ आह भगवान् ॥ ४ ॥ *Chaturmukha* *Brahma* tells. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 5: येषाम् अथ� रिजः आ�ा�ायुधो यो� ित तत् प�ो जेता इित ॥ ५ ॥ In whose side *Raji*, being well armed, he fights, that side is going to win, he says *. ** * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 6: अथ दै�ैः उपे� रिजः आ� साहा�दानाया�िथ�तः प्राह ॥ ६ ॥ Then all the *daityaas* go first to *Raji*, and ask him - "Can you please help us in this war?". * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 7: यो�े अहं भवताम् अथ� यिद अहम् अमर जयात् भवताम् इ�ो भिव�ािम इित; आकण� एतत् तैः अिभिहतम् ॥ ७ ॥ He says "I am willing to fight on your side, but I have one condition, if you win over the gods, I want to become the Indra". Listening to this, the *daityaas* say thus. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 8:   [[120]] of 249

They say that "Our Indra is only *Prahlaada*, and for that reason only, I am fighting the gods, so that *Prahlaada* can become the Indra". They did not accept *Raji's* offer that he wanted to become Indra. They went back being disappointed. After that, the gods approached Raji, and asked him the same thing - "Can you please help us and fight on our side, we want to win over the *daityaas*". The gods agreed to his condition. "We agree to your condition that if we win over the *daityaas*, you will be the Indra". * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 9: रिजना अिप देव सै� सहायेन अनेकैः महा अ�ैः तत् अशेषम् असुर बलम् िनदूिषतम् ॥ ९ ॥ *Raji* helped the army of *devaas*, and using variety of weapons, the demons were destroyed. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 10: अथ िजत अ�र प�ः च देवे�ो रिज चरणयुगलम् आ�नः िशरसा िनपी� आह ॥ १० ॥ After winning, *Indra* went and fell at the feet of *Raji*, and then he says thus. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 11: भय त्राणात् अ�दानात् भवान् अ�त् िपता अशेष लोकानाम् उ�मो�मो भवान् य� अहं पुत्रः ित्रलोके�ः ॥ ११ ॥ He says - "You protected me from this fear of the *daityaas* and have given us food, you are my father, you are the most supreme in all the worlds, I am now your son; I was the *Indra*, and I am now your son". Then the king understood what he meant. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 12: स च अिप राजा प्रह� आह ॥ १२ ॥ The king smiled and said thus. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 13:  एवम् अ�ु एवम् अ�ु अनितक्रमणीया िह वै�र प�ात् अिप अनेक िवध चाटु वा� गभा� प्रणितः इित उ�ा � पुरं जगाम ॥ १३ ॥ He said - "Let it be so, let it be so, I understood your tricky words, I understood your trick.

You have to win over kingdoms, but not accept from one who has fallen at your feet. This is the *raaja* *dharma*. So he did not accept. This is why *Indra* fell at his feet, as he did not want to give that. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 14: शतक्रतुः अिप इ��ं चकार ॥ १४ ॥ Shatakratu became the *Indra*, as usual. He retained his position. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 15: �या�ते तु रजौ नारदिष� चोिदता रिज पुत्राः शतक्रतुम् आ� िपतृ पुत्रं समाचारात् रा�ं यािचतव�ः ॥ १५ ॥ Once *Raji* passed away, *Naarada* comes to *Raji's* sons and tells that they are entitled as their father has won over the *Indra* *padavi*, and returned back to him, go and ask him; and they go to *Shatakratu*, *Indra*, and say that "We are the actual sons of *Raji*, we are entitled to this position as he has won over that and has given to you, this is our birthright". They ask Indra to give the position back. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: �या�त इित | आचरात् िपतृदयाद �ायात् | * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 16: अप्रदानेन च िविज� इ�म् अितबिलनः �यम् इ��म् चक्रुः ॥ १६ ॥ They were very powerful. *Indra* did not agree to give. They defeated him and got the *Indra* *padavi*. They won over him. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 17:  ततः च ब�ितथे काले िह अतीते बृह�ितम् एका�े �ष्�ा अप�त त्रैलो� य� भागः शतक्रतुः उवाच ॥ १७ ॥ *Indra*, because nobody was offering *havis* to him, whatever *havis* was offered, was going to whoever was sitting in the *Indra* *padavi*, *Raji's* sons; *Shatakratu* was deprived of his *havir* *bhaaga*; when he was roaming around, after a long time, he saw *Bruhaspati* alone. Then he tells him. * * [[122]] of 249

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 18: बदरीफलमात्रम् अिप अह�िस समा�ायनाय पुरोडाश ख�ं दातुम् इित उ�ो बृह�ितः उवाच ॥ १८ ॥ O *Bruhaspati*, do something so that at least I get a purodaasha, havis, at least of the quantity of *Badari* *phala* \( *elachi* *hannu*, ಎಲ� ಹಣು� in *Kannada*\). Why can't you help me in this. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 19: यिद एवं �या अहं पूव�म् एव चोिदतस्�ां त�या �दथ� िकम् अकत��म् इित अ�ैः एवाहोिभः �ां िनजं पदं प्रापिय�ािम इित अिभधाय तेषाम् अनुिदनम् अिभचारकं बु�� मोहाय शक्र� तेजोिभवृ�ये जुहाव ॥ १९ ॥ *Bruhaspati* says - "If you had told me earlier itself, what is it that I should not do for your sake, I would have done anything. I will definitely do very soon, within a few days, you will get your position back". Then, everyday he started to do *aabhichaarika* *karma*. These *karmaas* are told in Atharva *Veda*, *Shyena* *yaaga*. These *karmaas* he did in order to get *buddhi* *moha*, in order to do delusion to the *Indra* who was presently there, Raji's son, and also to increase the *tejas* of *Shatakratu*, the *Indra* who was there earlier. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पुरोधसा अिप यजमान चोिदतेन एव का�ं कम� कत��ं न तु अ�था , तत् इ�या अ�ात�ािद�िभप्रे� आह यिद एवम् इित | If *kaamya* *karmaas* are to be done, whoever is the *Bruhaspati*, for the king, he should not do by himself, unless he is asked by the king. *Bruhaspati* has to be requested specifically by the *yajamaana*, that he wants to do this *kaamya* *karma*, otherwise he will not do by himself. *Bruhaspati* did not know this desire, as *Indra* did not explicitly ask him. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 20: ते च अिप तेन बु�� मोहेन अिभभूयमान ब्र�ि�षो धम� �ािगनो वेद वाद पराङ्मुखा बभूवुः ॥ २० || Because of the effect of the *aabhichaarika* *karma*, they \( *Raji's* sons\) had *buddhi* *moha*, they were confused, did not know what is dharma, what is *adharma*, they started hating *Brahmins*, and gave up *dharma*, and were opposed to whatever is told in the *Vedaas*. They gave up *dharma*, and were opposed to whatever *Veda* says. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 21:  ततः तान् अपेतधमा�चरान् इ�ो जघान ॥ २१ ॥  [[123]] of 249

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 Because they lost all the *dharma* *aacharane*, their *tejas* reduced, and *Indra's* *tejas* having increased, he killed all of them. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 22: पुरोिहत आ�ाियत तेजाः च शक्रो िदवम् आक्रमत् ॥ २२ ॥ With the increased *tejas* that *Indra* got, because of the *aabhichaarika* karma which the *purohita* *Bruhaspati* did, he occupied his position back. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 23: एतत् इ�� �पद �वनात् आरोहणं श्रु�ा पु�षः �पद भ्रंशं दौरा�ं च ना�ोित ॥ २३ ॥ One who listens to the story of how Indra lost his position, and again regained it back, such a person will never lose his position. He will also not become wicked. He will always be good. This is the *phala* for one who listens to this story. ****Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 24: रंभः तु अनप�ो अभवत् ॥ २४ ॥ The other son of *Pururavas*, *Rambha* did not have any children. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 25: �त्रवृ� सुतः प्रित�ेत्रो अभवत् ॥ २५ ॥ *Kshatravruddha's* son was *Pratikshatra*. * * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: पूव� �त्रवृ�ात् सुहोत्रो गृ�मदात् ि�जाितवंशकृत् उ�ः इह तु प्रित�त्रः �त्र एक वंशकृत् उ�ते �त्रवृ�सुतः प्रित�त्रो अभवत् इ�ािदना | Earlier also the *vamsha* of *Kshatravruddha* was told - *Kaashya* and others, they are supposed to be the sons of *Kshatravruddha's* son *Suhotra*. They were all *Brahmins*. Here, only the *Kshatriya* *vamsha* is being told. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 26: तत् पुत्रः संजयः त� अिप जयः त� अिप िवजयः त�ात् च ज�े कृतः ॥ २६ ॥ *Pratikshatra* had a son by name *Sanjaya*, his son was *Jaya*, his son was *Vijaya*, then *Kruta*. * * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 9, Shloka 27:  त� च हय�धनः हय�धन�ुतः सहदेवः त�ात् अदीनः त� जय�ेनः ततः च संकृितः तत् पुत्रः �त्रधमा� इित एते �त्रवृ�� वं�ाः ॥ २७ ॥  [[124]] of 249
