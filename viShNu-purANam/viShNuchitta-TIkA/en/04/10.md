www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 All the rice, grains, gold, all the cows, all the women, the entire thing is not sufficient for one person; so desire is something which one has to give up. Desire can never be satisfied.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 25: यदा न कु�ते भावं सव�भूतेषु पापकं | सम��ेः तदा पुंसः सवा�ः सुखमया िदशः ॥ २५ ॥ When, in all the beings, one does not have a bad feeling, he will have *samadrushti*, he will be equally disposed towards everyone, and at that time, he will have all round happiness.* * Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: यदा इित | पापकं राग�ेषािद |* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 26: या दु� जा दुम�ितिभः या न जीय�ित जीय�तः | तां तृ�ां सं�जेत् प्रा�ः सुखेन एव अिभपूय�ते ॥ २६ ॥ That which cannot be given up by bad people, wicked people, and even when you become old, that which does not become old, \(as a person becomes old also, the desire does not get old, it remains young\), that desire one has to give up completely.

If he gives up desire, without any difficulty he will become a complete person.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 27: जीय��� जीय�तः केशाः द�ा जीय��� जीय�तः | धन आशा जीिवताशा च जीय�तो अिप न जीय�तः ॥ २७ ॥ As one gets old, hairs become old and they fall; teeth also become weak and old.

These never get old even if one gets very old.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 28: पूण� वष�सहस्रं मे िवषयास� चेतसः | तथा अिप अनुिदनं तृ�ा मम तेषु उपजायते ॥ २८ ॥ I spent one thousand years being totally interested in enjoying the pleasures of the senses, in spite of that, every single day, my desire is only increasing.* * Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 10, Shloka 29:  त�ात् एताम् अहम् ��ा ब्र�िण आधाय मानसम् | िन�न्�ो िनम�मो भू�ा च�र�ािम मृगैः सह ॥ २९ ॥  [[129]] of 249
