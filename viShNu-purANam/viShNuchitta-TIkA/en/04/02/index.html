<p><a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 There is a well known shloka with respect to <em>Ratheetara</em> - Though <em>Ratheetaraas</em> are of <em>Kshatriya vamsha</em>, they somehow got connected with <em>Aangeerasa gotra</em>, and they became called as <em>Aangirasaas</em>. From <em>Kshatriya vamsha</em>, they became <em>Brahmins</em>. ***Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary:<br>

By doing tapas, they became <em>Braahmanaas</em>. In the <em>Vaayu Puraana</em>, it is said that starting with <em>Vishvaamitra</em>, through tapas, they became <em>Brahmins. Vishvaamitra</em>, even though a <em>Kshatriya</em>, became a <em>Brahmin</em> because of his background - <em>brahma-kshatra</em>. They got connected with <em>Braahmana</em>, they are <em>Brahma kshatraas</em>. Through tapas, they could become <em>Brahmins</em>. Many names are told here - they all became <em>rishis</em> through <em>tapas</em>. This continues further, which we see next. We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 4, Chapter 2, where <em>Manu&rsquo;s vamsha anucharita</em> is being told, the details of his son&rsquo;s <em>vamsha</em> were told, <em>Naabhaaga</em>, and <em>Ratheetara</em>. And the people belonging to <em>Ratheetara&rsquo;s</em> clan, became <em>brahmakshatraas</em>, was told, having got connected with <em>Angirasa gotra</em>. Continuing further, now, <em>Ikshvaaku vamsha</em> details will be told.</p>
