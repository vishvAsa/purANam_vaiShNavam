Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 1: मैत्रेयः - िहर�किशपु�े च रावण�े च िव�ुना | अवाप िनहतो भोगान् अप्रा�ानामरैः अिप ॥ १ ॥ *Maitreyar* - When he was killed by *saakshaat Vishnu* only, when he was *Hiranyakashipu*, and also when he was born as *Raavana*, he attained all the enjoyments which are not even attainable by the gods. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 2: न लयं तत्र तेन एव िनहतः स कथं पुनः | संप्रा�ः िशशुपाल�े सायु�ं शा�ते हरौ ॥ २ ॥ But, he never attained *Saayujya* in those two births as *Hiranyakashipu* and *Raavana*, even though he was killed by Bhagavaan directly. When he was born as *Shishupaala*, he attained *saakshaat moksha* itself. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 3: एतत् इ�ािम अहं श्रोतुं सव� धम�भृतां वर | कौतूहल परेण एतत् पृ�ो मे व�ुमह�िस ॥ ३ ॥ I would like to know why such a thing happened. In all the three births, he was hating *Bhagavaan* only. You who are knowledgeable about all the *dharmaas*, please do tell me. I am very curious to know this.

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 दै�े�र� वधाय अ�खल लोक उ�ि� �स्थित िवनाश का�रणा पूव� तनुग्रहणं कुव�ता नृिसंह �पं आिव�ृतम् ॥ ४ ॥ *Sri Paraasharar* - In order to kill *Hiranyakashipu*, One who is responsible for the creation, sustenance and also dissolution of all the worlds, *Bhagavaan* incarnated taking the form of *Nrisimha*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 5: तत्र च िकर�किशपोः िव�ुरयं इित एतत् न मनिस अभूत् ॥ ५ ॥ During that birth, however, *Hiranyakashipu* did not recognize *Nrisimha* as *saakshaat Bhagavaan*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 6: िनरितशय पु� समुभूतम् एतत् स�जातम् इित ॥ ६ ॥ He thought that this is some strange creation, who had a combination of *nara* and *simha*, man-lion, and due to some great punya, this kind of creature is born. He did not recognize *saakshaat Vishnu* in that form. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 7: राजोद्रेक प्रे�रत एकाग्रमितः तत् भावना योगात् ततः अवा� वध हैतुकी ं िनरितशयाम् एव अ�खल त्रैलो� आिध� का�रणी ं दशानन�े भोगसंपदम् अवाप ॥ ७ ॥ Because his *rajas* became extremely high, because of thinking about Him only, he developed so much of hatred, and he was killed by *saakshaat* Bhagavaan Himself, in the form of *Nrisimha*, as a result of that, he *obtained* unparalleled wealth and rulership of all the three worlds as *Dashaanana*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 8: न तु स त��न् अनािदिनधने परब्र�भूते भगवित अनाल��िन कृते मनसः तत् लयम् अवाप ॥ ८ ॥ But he never fixed his mind thinking that He is *Bhagavaan* only, One who is beginningless and endless, that He is *saakshaat Parabrahma* as praised in the *Shrutis*, that He is the *aadhaara* for everyone, He does not exist within the *aadhaara* of anyone else. *Dashaanana* never fixed his mind in *Bhagavaan*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 9:  एवं दशानन�े अिप अन� पराधीनतया जानकी समास� चेतसा भगवता दाशरिथ �प धा�रणा हत� तत् �पदश�नम् एव आसीत् न अयम् अ�ुत इित आस��ः िवप�तो अ�ः करणे मानुषबु��ः एव केवलम् अ� अभूत् ॥ ९ ॥ Even when he was born as *Raavana*, he was under the sway of *kaama*, he was interested in *Jaanaki* under the passion of *kaama*, and *Bhagavaan*  [[181]] of 249

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 incarnated as *Daasharathi, Dasharatha's* son *Raama* and killed him. *Raavana* thought that *Raama* was only a man, an ordinary human, and never recognized Him as *Achyuta*. He thought Him as just a *manushya*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 10: पुनरिप अ�ुत िविनपात मात्र फलम् अ�खल भूम�ल �ा� चेिदराज कुले ज� अ�ाहत ऐ�य� िशशुपाल�े अिप अवाप ॥ १० ॥ Because he was killed by *saakshaat Bhagavaan*, the *Chedi* kingdom was a great one, the *Chedi raaja's vamsha* was praised in the entire earth, he was born in that *vamsha*, with unending wealth, he obtained all of this, born as *Shishupaala*. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 11: तत्र तु अ�खलानाम् एव सः भगवन् ना�ां �ंकारकारणम् अभवत् ॥ ११ ॥ *Shishupaala* kept blaming Him taking all these names - " *Tvam, tvam*", pointing fingers at Him, as "You are like this, You are like that", developing great hatred towards Him. He took every name of *Bhagavaan*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: तत्र तु इित | �ंकरणनािन करोित इित �ंकारकं त� कारणं तत् प्रवृि� िनिम�म् | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 12:  ततः च तत् काल कृतानां तेषां अशेषाणाम् एव अ�ुत ना�ाम् अनवरतम् अनेक ज� सुविध�त िव�ेष अनुब�� िच�ः िविन�न संतज�न आिदषु उ�ारणम् अकरोत् ॥ १२ ॥ During that *avataara kaala, Bhagavaan* had taken all the names. *Shishupaala* kept on repeating all those names. *Shishupaala* had developed so much of hatred over many births that he kept on repeating those names without any break. *Shishupaala* kept on blaming and ridiculing, and threatening Him. But he kept on repeating the various names of *Bhagavaan*. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: ततः च इित | ऋिषप्रो�मामिनव�चनात् अनादरेण िन�नाथ� उपे�या च भगवन् ना�ाम् उ�ारणम् अकरोत् इित संकीत�न उ��ः | For every *Naama* of *Bhagavaan*, there is a *Rishi prokta naama nirvachana*, which is the meaning of the name as told by a *Rishi. Shishupaala* never gave attention to that. *Shishupaala* only ridiculed and blamed Him. *Gopaala* means "One who protects the *Vedaas*", "One who protects all worlds", these are the *nirvachanas*. But, *Shishupaala* took it as an ordinary cowherd, and started finding defects in Him. But, he kept on repeating *Bhagavaan's naama*.

He had four arms wearing the wonderful discus, conch and *aayudhaas*. Because of the hatred developed, all the time, he was thinking of *Bhagavaan's* form only.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 15: तावत् च भगवत् चक्रेण आशु �ापािदतः तत् �रण अ�खल द� स�यः भगवता अ�म् उपनीतः त��न् एव लयम् उपययौ ॥ १५ ॥ Immediately, *Shishupaala* was killed by the *Sudarshana Chakra* of *Bhagavaan*, and because of remembering Him, he had all his sins destroyed completely. He was killed by *Bhagavaan* and went and united with *Bhagavaan* Himself. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary: तावत् इित | लयं सायु�म् | Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 16:  एतत् तव अ�खलं मया अिभिहतम् ॥ १६ ॥  [[183]] of 249

Those who are highly devoted to Him, what to say about them? Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 18: वसुदेव� तु आनकदुन्दुभेः पौरवी रोिहणी मिदरा भद्रा देवकी प्रौमुखाः बह्�ः प�ो अभवन् ॥ १८ ॥ *Vasudeva* who was also known as *Aanakadundubhi* had many wives - *Pouravee, Rohinee, Madiraa, Bhadraa, Devakee* - these are prominent.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 15, Shloka 28: अन�रं च स�मं गभ�म् अध�रात्रे भगवत् प्रिहता योगिनद्रा रोिह�ा जठरम् आकृ� नीतवती ॥ २८ ॥ For the seventh *garbha*, in the middle of the night, due to the directions of *Bhagavaan, Yoganidraa* snatched it from her womb and placed it to *Rohinee*.
