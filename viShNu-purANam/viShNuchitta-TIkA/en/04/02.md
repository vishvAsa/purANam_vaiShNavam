**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 2, Shloka 2:   


Tat cha asya bhraatru shatam punyajanatraasaaddisho bheje | ****Raivata* had hundred brothers, and he was the eldest. Because of not being able to tolerate the cruelty of *Punyajana raakshasaas*, these brothers ran away in all directions. *

Tat anvayaah cha kshatriyaah sarva dikshu abhavan | ***Because of this, all the brothers of *Kakudmi Raivata*, they had their children, and so *Kshatriyaas* were present in all directions. *

www.sadagopan.orgSri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4 There is a well known shloka with respect to *Ratheetara* - Though *Ratheetaraas* are of *Kshatriya vamsha*, they somehow got connected with *Aangeerasa gotra*, and they became called as *Aangirasaas*. From *Kshatriya vamsha*, they became *Brahmins*. ***Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary:

By doing tapas, they became *Braahmanaas*. In the *Vaayu Puraana*, it is said that starting with *Vishvaamitra*, through tapas, they became *Brahmins. Vishvaamitra*, even though a *Kshatriya*, became a *Brahmin* because of his background - *brahma-kshatra*. They got connected with *Braahmana*, they are *Brahma kshatraas*. Through tapas, they could become *Brahmins*. Many names are told here - they all became *rishis* through *tapas*. This continues further, which we see next. We are studying *Amsha* 4, Chapter 2, where *Manu's vamsha anucharita* is being told, the details of his son's *vamsha* were told, *Naabhaaga*, and *Ratheetara*. And the people belonging to *Ratheetara's* clan, became *brahmakshatraas*, was told, having got connected with *Angirasa gotra*. Continuing further, now, *Ikshvaaku vamsha* details will be told.
