Because *Krishna* is *sarvajnya*, He knows everything. In order that *Duryodhana* should not put any effort to go in search of them, in order to do His duties as part of the *kula*, He goes to *Vaaranaavata*.

The brightness of the *Syamantaka Mani* was such that it could dispel the darkness of all the three worlds. Such a *Syamantaka Mani* has been stolen by *Shatadhanva*, when he killed *Satraajit*.

If the tree is destroyed, the birds resting in the tree will also lose their refuge, so one has to destroy the tree itself. He said - "I understand your grief".

If *Sri Krishna* tramples His foot once, all the three worlds will tremble. By killing all the *asuraas*, He made all the wives of *asuraas* as widows. A powerful army also cannot stop His discus. He has a discus which cannot be stopped by even a mighty army. The greatness of *Balaraama* is - with his intoxicated eyes rolling, if He immediately looks at the enemy army, immediately all of them will lose their powers and they run away; they cannot face even His eyes rolling with anger. The very look of His eyes will scare away all the enemies. He can destroy enemy armies like an elephant. The *Halaayudha* is such a powerful weapon that it can kill even powerful enemies, like an elephant. Such a weapon He has got. *Balaraama* is that powerful. *Krishna* and *Balaraama* have this kind of powers. With them, who will fight? Even gods who are respected by all the worlds, even the best among gods also cannot face them, cannot fight against them. Sri Engal Aalwaan’s Commentary:  [[158]] of 249
