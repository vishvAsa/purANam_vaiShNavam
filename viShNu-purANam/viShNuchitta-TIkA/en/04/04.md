He has got *shubha aashraya, **divya mangala vigraha*, divine auspicious form. He does not have the shat *bhaava vikaaraas - asti, jaayate, vardhate, viparinamate, apaksheeyate, **nashyati*. How can we know, call Him? He is always existing, in any form. How did *Khatvaanga* unite with the *Paramaatman*, is explained here. This is told in the *Upanishads*, as per the injunction given in the *Shrutis*, that one has to offer oneself to *Bhagavaan*. That *Purusha* is itself the *havis*.
