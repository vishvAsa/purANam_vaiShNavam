He is the proper ruler. When the *Brahmins* told like this, Shantanu's minister *Ashmaraavi*, sent some *tapasvis* into the forest, who were arguing everything against what is told in the *Vedaas*, in the wrong way. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 22: तैः अ� अिप अितऋजुमतेः महीपितपुत्र� बु��ः वेदवाद िवरोध मागा�नुसा�रिण अिक्रयत ॥ २२ ॥ Because of their companionship, he also started to tell things against the *Vedaas*, against the *Shrutis. Devaapi* was also in their company. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 23: राजा च श�नुः ि�जवचन उ�� प�रदेवन शोक�ान् ब्रा�णान् अग्रतः कृ�ा अग्रज� प्रदानाय अर�ं जगाम ॥ २३ ॥ In the meanwhile, King *Shantanu* felt very bad that he is doing a wrong thing, and he took those Brahmins and went to the forest, in order to give the kingdom to his elder brother *Devaapi*.

Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 26:  [[209]] of 249

He started to prove that all those things were wrong. His arguments were against the *Vedaas. Devaapi* fell from the path of righteousness only during that time, because in the next *Kruta yuga, Devaapi* is said to be the restorer of the *Kshatriya* race. He fell from the path of righteousness only for a brief time. Whatever is told in the mantra as यत् देवािपः शंतनवे पुरोिहतम् is applicable to another *kalpa. Devaapi* started to bring out arguments against what the *Brahmins* said. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 27: ततः ते ब्रा�णाः श�नुम् ऊचुः ॥ २७ ॥ Then the *Brahmins* told *Shantanu* thus. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 28: आग� हे राज�लमत्र अित िनब��ेन | प्रशा� एव असौ अनावृि� दोषः | पिततः अयम् अनािदकालम् अिभिहत वेद वचन दूषण उ�ारणात् ॥ २८ ॥ O King *Shantanu*, you can go back to your kingdom. Whatever wrong you had done is all corrected as *Devaapi* has fallen from the path of righteousness, and you will not have any problem. There will be rains in your kingdom. He has fallen from the path of righteousness, because he is talking against the *Vedaas*, which is established from time immemorial. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 29: पितते च अग्रजे न एव ते प�रवे�ृ�ं भवित इित उ�ः श�नुः �पुरम् आग� रा�म् अकरोत् ॥ २९ ॥ When your elder brother is away from the path of righteousness, you will not be a *parivettaa* anymore. *Shantanu* came back to his country and started to rule over that place. Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 4, Chapter 20, Shloka 30:  [[210]] of 249

Because *Devaapi* had gone away from the path of righteousness, *Shantanu* was eligible to rule over the country.
