<p>After knowing all the fourteen <em>bhuvanaas</em>, how they were created, how people are there, what kind of people are there, what kind of <em>yuga dharmaas</em> are there, about all the <em>Vedaas</em> and everything, now he wants to know the means by which one can escape this <em>samsaara</em>.</p>

<p>**Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Ayam iti | Ayam eva prashno nakulena bheeshmam prati prushtah; atah sah ****nakulaaya aaha iti anvayah | **</p>
<p>This is going to come now, which we see next. We will go into details about what <em>Bheeshmar</em> tells <em>Nakula</em>.</p>
<p>In this session, we studied the details of the 18 <em>Puraanaas</em>, about how many <em>shlokaas</em> are there, how it is told in other <em>Puraanaas. Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> says that he is commenting on 6000 <em>shlokaas</em> of <em>Vishnu Puraana</em>. The 14 *dharmavidyaa *<em>sthaanaas</em> were told, which are very important for us to study. Also <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[69]] of 219</p>
<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3</p>
<p>the <em>upavedaas</em> were told. It was declared that the <em>Vedaas</em> are eternal, <em>nitya</em>. For creation, sustenance, dissolution, the one responsible God is Lord <em>Mahaavishnu</em> only; this is what is declared in all the 18 <em>Puraanaas</em>. Though there are different <em>shaakhaas</em> of the <em>Vedaas</em>, being studied in different <em>manvantaraas</em> and different <em>yugaas</em>, the eternality of <em>Veda</em> does not get affected. As a unit, <em>Vedaas</em> are one. Now, <em>Paraasharar</em> is going to tell about the means by which one can get liberation, to not come under the sway of <em>Yama</em>. We are in <em>Amsha</em> 3, Chapter 7, where <em>Maitreyar</em> told <em>Sri Paraasharar</em> that &ldquo;You have told me everything that I have asked for, the 14 worlds in the <em>Brahmaanda</em>, the <em>sapta dveepaas</em>, and whatever is there inside this <em>Brahmaanda</em>, and all the kinds of beings who are here, starting with the most subtle to the most gross. I also understand that there are innumerable beings, in this <em>Brahmaanda</em>, who are all caught here in this <em>samsaara</em>, due to their past <em>karma</em>; and there is not even one-eighth of an inch, where we cannot find one living being. All these beings after dying, go to hell and then to heaven, and keep moving here, getting born again and again. Are there any beings who are not under the sway of <em>Yama</em>, who get rid of this <em>samsaara</em>, and get liberated; I would like to know about them.&rdquo; What <em>Maitreyar</em> really wants to know is the means to <em>Moksha</em>, the <em>Moksha dharma</em>, which is explained in the commentary.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Paraasharar</em> starts to tell about the dialogue between <em>Yama</em> and his assistant, <em>bhata</em>. Finally he wants to tell about the dharma, the means which is told in <em>Shruti, Smruti, Itihaasa, Puraana</em>, which when performed with an idea of worship of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, will lead one to <em>Moksha</em>. So that one can escape from this <em>samsaara</em>, the cycle of birth and death, and get liberated. In order to tell about this, he starts with the <em>Yama bhata samvaada. Paraasharar</em> says what he heard from what <em>Bheeshmar</em> had told <em>Nakula</em>.</p>

<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 7:  ****So aham icchaami tat shrotum yamasya vashavartinah | **<strong>Na bhavanti naraa yena tat karma kathayasva me ||</strong> Those who do not come under the sway of <em>Yama</em> but they escape from <em>samsaara</em>, what is that they should do, I want to know.</p>

<p>**Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Ayam iti | Ayam eva prashno nakulena bheeshmam prati prushtah; atah sah **<a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[70]] of 219</p>
<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3</p>
<p>**nakulaaya aaha iti anvayah | **<em>Nakula</em> had asked the very same question to <em>Bheeshma</em>; what <em>Bheeshma</em> told <em>Nakula</em>, I will tell you.</p>
<h2 id="9">9</h2>
<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 9:  ****Bheeshmah - ****Puraa mamaagato vatsa sakhaa kaalingako dvijah | **<strong>Sa maam uvaacha prushto vai mayaa jaatismaro munih ||</strong> *Bheeshma *- One <em>Brahmin</em> known to me came from <em>Kaalinga desha</em>, and that <em>muni</em> told me when I asked him this question. The <em>muni</em> by name <em>Jaatismara</em>, told <em>Kaalingaka</em> and <em>Kaalingaka</em> is telling <em>Bheeshma</em> that &ldquo;I will tell you what that <em>muni</em> told me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The second <em>anvaya</em> is told by <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> at the very end of this chapter. That interpretation is like this. There is a sage by name <em>Jaatismara</em>. The <em>Brahmin</em> from <em>Kaalinga desha</em> met me. When <em>Bheeshma</em> asked that *Kaalingaka *<em>dvija</em>, he told *Bheeshma *- &quot; <em>Mayaa jaatismaro munih</em>&quot; is <em>Kaalingaka&rsquo;s</em> words. The <em>Kaalingaka Brahmin</em> says that &ldquo;I had asked another <em>muni</em>, by name <em>Jaatismara</em> who told me this&rdquo;. This is the second <em>anvaya</em>. What <em>Bheeshma</em> is telling is &quot; *Puraa mamaagato vatsa sakhaa kaalingako dvijah. Sa maam uvaacha&quot;. *<em>&ldquo;Prushto vai mayaa jaatismaro munih</em>&rdquo; is what <em>Kaalingaka</em> is telling <em>Bheeshma</em>. The next few <em>shlokaas</em>, we have to understand that this is what the <em>muni</em> told <em>Kaalingaka</em>.</p>
<p>So, there are two *anvayaas *- one, that a <em>muni</em> told <em>Kaalingaka</em>, and <em>Kaalingaka</em> told <em>Bheeshma</em>, and <em>Bheeshma</em> told <em>Nakula</em>. Another is that <em>Kaalingaka</em> himself is the <em>muni</em>, who told <em>Bheeshma</em>, and <em>Bheeshma</em> is telling <em>Nakula</em>.</p>
<p>**Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Sa kaalingako munih tvayaa prushtam imam artham mayaa prushto maam prati ****uvaacha iti aaha puraa iti | **There are two interpretations which come for this <em>shloka</em> and the <em>shloka</em> coming after this.</p>

Even if that <em>Vishnu naama</em> is pronounced loudly, those who are in hell, in <em>naraka</em>, also, by just listening to it, will escape from the <em>naraka</em>, and <em>Yama</em> will have nobody to rule over there; then he will lose his control over all of them; therefore he got scared, and that is why he is telling in hushed voice in the ear, the teachings which are told are &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have relations with the wives of kings&rdquo;, and things like that, are told in secrecy, the <em>raaja neeti</em>, which can lead to great difficulty.</p>

<p>The various ornaments made of gold are recognized as the same gold.

Here, <em>samhartrutva</em> is told. He is the one who withdraws everything unto Himself during <em>pralaya</em>, or when the beings die. Wind blows and throws up all the dust. <em>Sura, nara, pashu</em>, are all created during <em>srushti</em> by <em>Bhagavaan</em>; during <em>srushti</em>, the <em>avyakta</em>, which is the *nitya *<em>dravya</em>, is present always, as <em>pradhaana</em>, this is the unmanifest *achetana *- this is made of three <em>gunaas - sattva, rajas, tamas</em>. When all three *sattva, rajas, *<em>tamas</em> are in equal proportion, <em>pralaya</em> happens. When any one of them becomes more or less, immediately at that point, creation happens. This is like a huge ocean, where at some place there is a tide, some place there is a bubble, this huge prakruti, <em>moola prakruti</em> or <em>pradhaana, avyakta</em>, at some place, *sattva, rajas, *<em>tamas</em> become uneven, due to <em>Bhagavat sankalpa; Bhagavaan</em> does <em>sankalpa</em>, because <em>achetana</em> cannot act by itself, it has not <em>jnyaatrutva, kartrutva</em>. Due to <em>Bhagavat sankalpa</em>, if there is difference in the <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em> proportion, immediately there is creation, *mahat, ahamkaara, tanmaatraas, panchabhootaas, *<em>deha, indriya</em>, and all the <em>deva, manushya, pashu</em>, are all created. This is <em>srushti</em>. During <em>pralaya</em>, the unevenness in <em>sattva, rajas, tamas</em> will be destroyed, and <em>prakruti</em> becomes equal. Everything will merge in the backward order - *pancha *<em>bhootaas</em> will merge into <em>tanmaatraas</em>, which merge into <em>ahamkaara</em>, which merges in <em>mahat tattva</em>, which merges into <em>prakruti, pradhaana</em>, and all <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[75]] of 219</p>

<p>the <em>chetanaas</em> go and join together, and become united with <em>Bhagavaan</em> as *tamah *<em>pare deve ekee bhavati</em>, which is <em>tamas shareera</em>. They go and join with *ekee *<em>bhaava</em>, as though it is not two, but one.</p>
<p>By the above two <em>shlokaas, kaaranatva</em>, and <em>samhartrutva</em> are told. <em>Yama</em> is telling his <em>bhata</em> about this, the glory of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, that He is the one who controls. Those who have taken refuge in Him, don&rsquo;t even go near them. <em>Yama</em> is warning him very secretly. While telling this, he is telling the glory of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, that He is the Lord of everything. He is the sole creator, and everything merges into Him during <em>pralaya</em>.</p>

The moon, the flood of cool moon rays, when that is there, in front of them, the heap of <em>hutaashana, Agni</em> which is having huge flames also, does not stand. In the same way, devotees of <em>Vishnu</em>, in whose mind, <em>Vishnu</em> who is without any defects, and is pure as the mountain of <em>sphatika</em>, He is established, there will be no defect at all, like <em>matsara</em> and others. When <em>Vishnu</em> is there, established in the mind of a person, how can there be any defect at all, like <em>matsara</em> and others, because <em>Vishnu</em> is as pure as a rock taken from a mountain of crystal; it does not have any defects, and it has all the good qualities.

<p>gone for <em>teertha yaatraa</em>; when he comes back afterwards, looking at <em>Upakosala</em>, he says - &ldquo;Your face is glowing as though you are knowledgeable about <em>Brahman</em>, like a <em>Brahmavit</em>. Who taught you?&rdquo;. This reflects the knowledge which is inside, <em>Bhagavaan</em> who is inside, in the mind of a person, is reflected outside in the external appearance of the person itself. The young tender sprout of <em>Saala</em> plant, is most beautiful, pleasant; with its look itself, it indicates the beautiful essence in the earth. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 26: ****Yama niyama vidhoota kalmashaanaam anudinam achyuta sakta maanasaanaam ****| ****Apagata mada maana matsaraanaam vraja bhata dooratarena maanavaanaam || **<em>Yama</em> tells his *bhata *- Those yogis who have got rid of all the defects of the mind, by practice of <em>Ashtaanga Yoga - Yama, Niyama, Aasana</em>, etc., and are of pure mind, and are meditating on <em>Bhagavaan</em> all the time, with utmost devotion and love; and because of that only, they have no arrogance or wrong notion, no <em>abhimaana</em>, no <em>matsara</em>, no <em>dosha</em>, with all the <em>doshaas</em> destroyed - from a distance itself, you will be able to recognize them. Don&rsquo;t even go near them. From a distance itself, go away from them. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 27: ****Hrudi yadi bhagavaan anaadiraaste harih asi shankha gadaadharo avyayaatmaa ****| ****Tadagham aghavighaata kartrubhinnam bhavati katham sati cha andhakaaram **<strong>arke ||</strong> That <em>Bhagavaan</em> who is without a beginning, that <em>anaadi Bhagavaan</em>, if He is present in the mind of a person; if a person is always meditating on <em>Bhagavaan</em>, with utmost love, <em>Hari</em>. That <em>Bhagavaan</em> is none other than <em>Hari</em>, wearing all His divine weapons, the sword, the <em>Shankha</em>, the <em>Gada</em>, and He is the <em>Avikaari</em>, unchanging <em>Paramaatman</em>. If there is any sin in such a person&rsquo;s mind, that will be cut off; a person who cuts off all the sins. *Agha vighaata *<em>kartaa</em> is <em>Bhagvaan</em> only. <em>Bhagavaan</em> is One who destroys all the sins. When such a Person is there, all the sins are destroyed. When the Sun is there, how can there be darkness. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Hrudi iti | Tat agham dhyaatuh paapam agha vighaata kartaa bhagavataa ****bhinnam videernam bhavati | Arke satyapi katham andhakaaram | **The sins of a person who is meditating upon <em>Vishnu</em>, gets destroyed completely by <em>Hari</em>, who is of the nature of destroying all the sins. When Sun is there, how can there be darkness. Now, <em>Yama</em> tells the signs of those who are not devotees of <em>Bhagavaan</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 28:  ****Harati paradhanam nihanti jantoon vadati tathaa anruta nishthuraani yah cha | ****Ashubha janita durmadasya pumsah kalusha mateh hrudi tasya na asti anantah ****|| **He steals others money, he kills or injures other beings, he tells all harsh words, and all untruth.

<p>commits, the evil deeds that he keeps doing, he develops a kind of arrogance. He has all the wrong knowledge in his mind, and his mind is full of defects. <em>Ananta</em> cannot be present in such a persons mind. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Parahimsaadinaa doshena abhaktasya hrudi bhagavat asannidhih jnyaatum ****shakya iti aaha harati ityaadi chaturbhih | Harati iti | Nishthuraani purushaani **<strong>|</strong> In four <em>shlokaas, Yama</em> says that the <em>bhata</em> can also know who are the people in whose mind <em>Bhagavaan</em> is not there, who are not devotees of <em>Vishnu</em>, can know this also. They do <em>para himsaa</em> and other <em>doshaas</em>. It can be known that <em>Bhagavaan</em> is not present in such a persons mind. They utter harsh words. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 29: ****Na sahati parasampadam vinindaam kalusha matih kurute sataam asaadhuh | **<strong>Na yajati na dadaati yah cha santam manasi na tasya janaardano adhamasya ||</strong> He does not tolerate others prosperity. He is an evil minded person. He abuses all the <em>saadhu purushaas</em>. He insults or cheats noble persons. He does not perform <em>yajnya yaagaas</em>. He does not donate, does not do <em>daana</em>. He does not worship <em>Bhagavaan Vishnu</em>, through <em>yajnya yaagaas</em>, and other <em>karma anushthaana</em>; he does not donate to <em>Vishnu bhaktaas</em>. In such a lowly person, <em>Janaardana</em> cannot be present in his mind. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Na iti | Na yajati santam - vishnum na archayati, na dadaati tat bhaktaaya |</strong> **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 30: ****Parama suhrudi baandhave kalatre suta tanayaa pitru maatru bhrutya varge | ****Shathamatih upayaati yo artha trushnaam tam adhamacheshtam avehi na asya ****bhaktam || **In his dear friend, in his relatives, towards his wife, son, daughter, father, mother and all his servants -this wicked person or fraudulent person approaches all of them with a mind to make money, or with a desire to cheat them. Such a person who has evil deeds, you can very clearly know that he is not a <em>bhakta</em>, and go and catch him there. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Parama iti | Avehi na asya bhaktam iti bhakta padena nai sambandhah | ****Abhaktam avehi iti arthah | **For one who is not a devotee of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, go and catch him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 31:  ****Ashubha matih asat pravrutti saktah satatam anaarya kusheela sangamattah | ****Anudina kruta paapa bandhayuktah purusha pashuh na hi vaasudevabhaktah || **In these four <em>shlokaas, Yama</em> is explaining the characteristics of those who are not devotees of <em>Vishnu</em>. He is of impure mind. He is always attached to doing wrong deeds. All the time, he is inauspicious, and of bad conduct. He is attached to all the sensual pleasures. Because of this, he has some kind of arrogance. He is <em>aviveki</em>, cannot distinguish good from the bad, <em>dharma</em> from <em>adharma</em>. Everyday he is involved in doing bad deeds only. He is accumulating things all the time. He is <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[81]] of 219</p>

<p>getting bound by this. He is like an animal in the form of a human being. He is lowly person, cannot be a devotee of <em>Vishnu</em> at all. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Ashubhamatih iti | Anaaryam amangalam, kusheelam duhsheelam, sango ****vishayasangah, taih matah purusha pashuh avivekee | Anaarya kulsheela ****sangamatta iti paathah | **Next, <em>Yama</em> is coming back to <em>bhaktaas</em>. Some more characteristics of devotees of <em>Vishnu</em> are going to be told again. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 32: ****Sakalam idam aham cha vaasudevah parama pumaan parameshavarah sa ekah | **<strong>Iti matih achalaa bhavati anante hrudayagate vraja taan vihaaya dooraat ||</strong> All these are <em>Vaasudeva</em> only, the entire things are <em>Vaasudeva</em> only, I am also <em>Vaasudeva</em> only; everything is <em>Vaasudevaatmaka</em>, having <em>Vaasudeva</em> as its Inner Self. He is <em>antaryaami</em> present in everything. He is One, He is <em>Parama Purusha</em>. He is <em>Parameshvara</em>. When <em>Ananta</em> is firmly established in the mind, this kind of an understanding becomes unshaken in one persons mind. When one meditates on <em>Ananta</em>, and establishes Him firmly in the mind, for such a person, there is a clear understanding that everything is <em>Bhagavadaatamaka</em>, and he sees <em>Bhagavaan</em> everywhere. Don&rsquo;t even go near such a person, just run away from a distance itself. From a distance itself, you can recognize them. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Bhaktasya lakshanaantaram aaha sakalam iti |</strong> **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 33:  ****Kamalanayana vaasudeva vishno dharanihara achyuta shankha chakra paane | ****Bhava sharanam iteerayanti ye vai tyaja bhata dooratarena taan apaapaan || **Those who always keep pronouncing that <em>Bhagavaan</em>, who has Lotus Eyes, who is <em>Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Dharanidhara</em>, One who is holding the divine <em>Shankha</em> and <em>Chakra</em>, &ldquo;You are the refuge for me, please become my refuge, I am surrendering unto You&rdquo;, one who says like this, just run away from such a person. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Kamala nayana iti | Eerayanti iti vachanaat artha jnyaanam antarena api naama ****ucchaarana maatram eva paapa haram iti soochitam | Eeranam shravanaadeh **<strong>api upalakshanam |</strong> Even if one does not understand the meanings of the words *Kamalanayana, *<em>Vaasudeva, Vishnu, Dharanidhara, Achyuta, Shankha Chakra Paane</em>, but simply keeps telling that, and says &ldquo;You are the Ultimate Refuge for me, I seek refuge in Your Lotus Feet&rdquo;. One who says this, without even knowing the meanings of all these words, just run away from such a person. They are without any sins, they are very pure devotees of <em>Vishnu</em>. By mere pronouncing of the names of <em>Bhagavaan</em>, all the sins get destroyed. Pronouncing is also <em>upalakshana</em> to <em>shravana</em>, it also indicates <em>shravana</em>. This is why from the very beginning, <em>Yama</em> is clearly telling the <em>bhata</em> in a low, hushed voice, in his ears, that nobody else should listen to that. Because even if <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[82]] of 219</p>

<p>one listens to these things, sins will get destroyed, and there will be nobody in <em>naraka</em> for him to rule over. Even listening to <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s</em> name is due to great <em>punya</em>, and <em>shravana</em> itself is <em>alabhya</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 34: ****Vasati manasi yasya sah avyayaatmaa purushavarasya na tasya drushti paate | ****Tava gatih atha vaa mamaasti chakra pratihata veerya balasya sah anyalokyah **<strong>||</strong> That <em>Parama Purusha</em> who is <em>Mahaa Vishnu</em>, who is established firmly in one&rsquo;s mind, such an excellent person, a *purusha vara *- you cannot go near his sight also, or even I cannot go (says <em>Yama</em>). **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Vasati iti | Yasya manasi harih vasati tasya yaavat drushtipaatam chakram ****paribhramati, atah tat drushtipaate tat pratihata veerya balasya tava mama vaa ****gatih naasti | Sa tu anya lokyah - anya lokaarhah, na tu asmat lokaarhah, * Na ****khalu bhagavataa yamavishayam gacchanti iti vachanaat | **As long as he can see, as long as his sight reaches, for the entire distance, there is a <em>chakra</em> which is guarding him. <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s Sudarshana Chakra</em> is protecting them, as long as they can see. Till that distance, the <em>Chakra</em> is guarding them. Nobody can go near that because that will dispel all others, and will destroy anyone who goes near with a wrong intention. It will destroy all our valour, and we cannot even go near that area. You cannot also not enter, I cannot also not enter there. Such a person deserves some other place, not where our ruling is there. He will go to <em>Paramapada, Vishnu&rsquo;s Saamraajya</em>. He will not come here. <em>Bhaagavataas</em> will never go under the sway of <em>Yama</em>. <em>Kaalinga</em> concludes this. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 35: ****Kaalingah - ****Iti nija bhata shaasanaaya devo ravi tanayah sah kila aaha dharmaraajah | ****Mama kathitam idam cha tena tubhyam kuruvara samyak idam mayaa api cha ****uktam || ***Kaalinga *- In order to tell his assistant, what all he has to follow, and what are his instructions, <em>Vivasvaan&rsquo;s</em> son, <em>Vaivasvata</em>, who is <em>Yama</em>, whatever <em>Dharmaraaja</em> says, whatever was told to me by the <em>Yama bhata</em>, I have told you, I am telling you. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Iti iti | Tena yamabhatena |</strong> <em>Bheeshmar</em> is concluding this. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 36:  ****Bheeshmah - ****Nakulaih tat mama aakhyaatam poorvam tena dvi janmanaa | ****Kalingadeshaat abhyetya preetena sumahaatmanaa || ***Bheeshma *- This was told to me by that <em>Brahmin</em> long back. That <em>Brahmin</em> who came from <em>Kalinga desha</em>, he told me with great love, and I am telling you this. <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[83]] of 219</p>

<p>**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 37: ****Mayaa api etat yathaa anyaayam samyak vatsa tavoditam | **<strong>Yathaa vishnumrute naanyat traanam samsaara saagare ||</strong> As I heard, and as it is, I have also told you. This is the ultimate message that is given. There is nobody who can save us from this ocean of <em>samsaara</em>, other than <em>Vishnu</em>. In every <em>adhyaaya</em> of <em>Vishnu Puraana</em>, we see that <em>Vishnu</em> is <em>antaryaami</em> to everyone, is present everywhere. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 38:  ****Kimkaraah paasha dandaah cha na yamo na cha yaatanaah | **<strong>Samarthaah tasya yasya aatmaa keshavaalambanah tadaa ||</strong> All <em>Yama kinkaraas</em> who are holding the <em>Yama paasha, danda</em>, or even <em>Yama</em> or all those sufferings or *narakaas *- all of these cannot touch a person whose mind is always meditating upon <em>Keshava</em>, **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Kimkaraa iti | Yasya aatmaa keshava aalambanam iti aatma nivedanoktih | **This is <em>aatma nivedana</em> itself, surrendering oneself to <em>Bhagavaan</em> is known as <em>Keshavaalamabana</em>. *** Shravanam keertanam vishnoh smaranam paadasevanam | Archanam ****vandanam daasyam sakhyam aatma nivedanam || iti bhakteh nava vidha ukteh **<strong>|</strong> As told in the *Nava vidha bhakti - Shravana, Keertana, Smarana, Paadasevana, *<em>Archana, Vandana, Daasya, Sakhya, Aatmanivedana</em>. Everything culminates in <em>aatma nivedana</em>. **Evam ukta shravanaadi nava vidha antarangaam vakshyamaana sadaachaara ****upalakshanaa bhagavat eka chittataa svaroopalakshanaa bhagavati nirupaadhika **<strong>preetiroopaa bhaktih eva yama vashyatva nivaarikaa iti adhyaayaarthah |</strong> This is the gist of this <em>adhyaaya</em>, telling the <em>samvaada</em> of <em>Yama</em> and his <em>kinkara</em>, telling all the <em>lakshanaas</em> of <em>Vishnu Bhaktaas</em>, and also of those who are not *Vishnu **Bhaktaas *- the gist of this is given by <em>Sri Engal Aalwaan</em> here. Whatever is told here - <em>Shravana, Keertana, Smarana, Paadasevana</em>, etc. the <em>Nava vidha bhaktis</em>, having all of them and also including all the <em>sadaachaara lakshana</em> which is going to be told in further chapters, single-mindedly meditating upon <em>Bhagavaan</em>, fixing the mind on <em>Bhagavaan</em>, it should be of utmost loving devotion, that kind of devotion, can help one person getting rid of going under the sway of <em>Yama</em>. This is the gist of the <em>adhyaaya</em>. <em>Nirupaadhika preetiroopaa</em> is the most important thing, which <em>Bhaashyakaarar</em> tells so many times. **Athavaa asmin adhyaaye jaatismaro naama kaschit munih, tat ukti moolaa **<strong>kaalinga uktih bheeshmena nakulaaya uchyate |</strong> In the beginning, one more meaning was told - a <em>muni</em> named <em>Jaatismara</em>, in <em>Shloka</em> 9 of this Chapter. There is a <em>muni</em> by name <em>Jaatismara</em>, <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[84]] of 219</p>
<p>Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3</p>
<h2 id="39">39</h2>
<p>this <em>Jaatismara</em> told <em>Kaalinga</em>, and this is told by <em>Kaalinga</em> to <em>Bheeshma</em>, and this is told by <em>Bheeshma</em> to <em>Nakula</em>. **Tatra iyam yojanaa puraa mama ityaadi maam uvaacha iti antam bheeshma **<strong>vachanam |</strong> Up to &quot; <em>Maam uvaacha</em>&quot; is what <em>Bheeshma</em> is telling. **Prushto vai mayaa iti aarabhya anyathaa hi mayaa kvachit iti antam kaalinga **<strong>vaakya, tatra vatsa iti bheeshmasya sambodhanam |</strong> &quot; <em>Prushto vai mayaa</em>&quot; is <em>Kaalinga vachana</em>. Up to &quot; *Anyathaa hi mayaa kvachit&quot;. *<em>Kaalingaka</em> is telling <em>Jaatismara</em> whatever is told - it happened exactly like that, and that he has never seen anything happening in any other way. He is telling the truth. This is the other <em>anvaya</em> which is explained here. <strong>Dvijo jaatismarah | Ekadaa tu iti shloko bheeshma vaakyam |</strong> After this, &quot; <em>Ekadaa tu mayaa</em>&quot; is told by <em>Bheeshma</em>. <strong>Jaatismarena kathita ityaadi mayaa api cha uktam iti antam kaalinga vaakyam |</strong> The next <em>shloka - &ldquo;Jaatismarena kathito&rdquo;</em> up to &quot; <em>mayaa api cha uktam</em>&quot; is told by <em>Kaalinga</em>. **Mama kathitam idam cha tena iti atra tat shabdena jaatismarasya paraamarshah **<strong>|</strong> This is another <em>anvaya</em> told by <em>Kaalinga</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 7, Shloka 39:  ****Sri Paraasharah - ****Etat mune samaakhyaatam geetam vaivasvatena yat | **<strong>Tvat prashna anugatam samyak kim anyat shrotum icchasi ||</strong> *Sri Paraasharar *- O <em>Maitreyar</em>, as asked by you, I have told you nicely about what <em>Yama</em> said.
