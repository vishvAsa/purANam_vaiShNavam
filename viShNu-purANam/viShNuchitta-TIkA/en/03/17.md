If anyone is transgressing *Chaturmukha Brahma's* order, they will be my enemies, whether they are demons or gods. Because I have made *Chaturmukha Brahma* rule over the world, and given him the powers; everyone has to follow his orders. If they do not follow his orders, they will be destroyed by Me, because I am always established in sustaining this world. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 17, Shloka 44:  ****Tat gacchata na bheeh kaaryaa mayaamoho ayamagratah | ****Gacchannadya upakaaraaya bhavataam bhavitaa suraah ||** Make this *Maayaamoha* go in front and follow him. Don't be scared. He will lead you and help you in whatever you are asking, in destroying the *daityaas*. www.sadagopan.org  [[196]] of 219
