<p>**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 1: ****Maitreyah - ****Bhagavan bhagavaan devah samsaaravijigeeshubhih | **<strong>Samaakhyaahi jagannaatho vishnuh aaraadhyate yathaa ||</strong> O <em>Paraasharar, Jagannaatha</em>, who is <em>Bhagavaan Deva</em>, by those who want to win over this <em>samsaara</em>, how is He worshipped? Please do tell me. <em>Paraasharar</em> told about the <em>Vishnu bhaktaas</em> who escape from <em>Yama vashyatva</em>. He told about the <em>lakshanaas</em> of devotees of <em>Vishnu</em>. Now, he is asking about how they worship <em>Vishnu</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Poorvam bhagavat aajnyaa roopa shruti smruti ukta varna aashrama dharma ****anushthaanam bhakti lakshanam uktam | Idaaneem tat eva chaturvarga ****saadhanam iti uchyate bhagavan iti adhyaaya navakena | **From here onwards, up to the ninth chapter, <em>varna aashrama aachaaraas</em> will be told. <em>Bhakti</em> which is always associated with <em>varna aashrama dharma anushthaana</em>, are told in the <em>Shrutis</em> and <em>Smrutis</em>, these <em>Shrutis</em> and <em>Smrutis</em> which are &quot; *Mama eva *<em>aajnyaa&quot;, Bhagavat aajnyaa roopa</em>; the <em>varna aashrama dharmaas</em> have to be done with utmost devotion, which is as told in <em>Shrutis</em> and <em>Smrutis</em>, which is nothing but <em>Bhagavat aajnynaa</em>. With that only, one can attain all the four *purushaarthaas, *<em>dharma, artha, kaama, moksha</em>, is going to be told in nine chapters. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 2: ****Aaraadhitaat cha govindaat aaraadhana paraih naraih | **<strong>Yat praapyate phalam shrotum tat cha icchaami mahaamune ||</strong> When <em>Govinda</em> is worshipped by such devotees, what are the fruits that they get? Please do tell me that also. O <em>Mahaamuni</em>. <em>Sri Paraasharar</em> remembers another story and tells it now. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 3: ****Sri Paraasharah - ****Yat prucchati bhavaan etat sagarena mahaatmanaa | ****Ourvah praaha yathaa prushtah tat me nigaditah shrunu || ***Sri Paraasharar *- Once <em>Sagara</em> went and asked *Mahaatma Ourva *- Please do tell me how Vishnu is worshipped, how <em>Vishnu aaraadhana</em> is done. <em>Ourva Rishi</em> explains how <em>Vishnu</em> is going to be worshipped. Whatever <em>Ourva</em> told, I will tell you, please listen to me. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 4:  ****Sagarah pranipatya enam ourvam papraccha bhaargavam | **<a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[86]] of 219</p>

<p><strong>Vishnoh aaraadhana upaaya sambandham munisattama ||</strong> <em>Bhrugu&rsquo;s</em> son, <em>Ourva Maharshi</em> is <em>Bhaargava</em>, and he goes and pays obeisance to him, and requests him to please teach him this - how to worship <em>Vishnu</em>, how to do <em>Vishnu aaraadhana</em>, he goes and requests in a proper way. He does *deergha *<em>namaskaara</em>, and requests him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 5: ****Phalam cha aaraadhite vishnou yat pumsaam abhijaayate | **<strong>Sa cha aaha prushto yat tena tasmai tat me akhilam shrunu ||</strong> If <em>Vishnu</em> is worshipped by people, what are the fruits that they get? Whatever <em>Ourva Rishi</em> told <em>Sagara</em>, I am going to tell me, listen to me, says <em>Paraasharar</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 6: ****Ourvah - ****Bhoumam manoratham svargam svargavandyam cha yat padam | ****Praapnoti aaraadhite vishnou nirvaanam api chottamam || ***Ourva *- All the desires one can get in this world, and also in the <em>svarga lokaas</em>, and that which is kept in high position even by those who are in <em>svarga</em>, that position which they bow down to, the <em>Brahma padavi</em>; if Vishnu is worshipped, one can get all that. And also, the <em>atyuttama pada, nirvaana, moksha</em>, also one can get. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 7: ****Yat yat icchati yaavat cha phalam aaraadhite achyute | ****Tat tat aapnoti raajendra bhoori svalpam atha api vaa || **Whatever one desire, any amount one can get by worshipping <em>Vishnu</em>. Whether it is a big benefit or a small one, whatever it is, they get everything. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 8: ****Yat tu prucchasi bhoopaala katham aaraadhyate harih | **<strong>Tat aham sakalam tubhyam kathayaami nibodha me ||</strong> You are asking me how <em>Vishnu</em> is worshipped. I will tell you all those things in detail. Please do listen to me. The importance of <em>Varna Aashrama dharmaas</em> is stressed here again, at the beginning itself. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 9:  ****Varna aashrama aachaaravataa purushena parah pumaan | ****Vishnuh aaraadhyate panthaa na anyah tat toshakaarakah || **One who is following all the <em>Varna Aashrama dharmaas</em>, there is nothing else which pleases <em>Vishnu</em>, other than being worshipped by a person who is following all the <em>Varna Aashrama dharmaas</em>. This is the message we get in all the <em>shaastraas</em>. As it is told in *Sri Vishnu *<em>Puraana</em> here, it is also told in other places also. In <em>Bhagavad-Geeta</em> also, it is said *Tasmaat shaastram pramaanam te kaarya akaarya vyavasthitou | **Jnyaatvaa shaastra vidhaana uktam karma kartum iha arhasi || *And <em>Ashaastram aasuram</em> is told. <em>Varna aashrama dharmaas</em> as told in the <em>shaastraas</em> are very important. One who is practicing the *varna aashrama *<em>dharma</em> can only worship <em>Bhagavaan</em>; then only <em>Bhagavaan Vishnu</em> will be most <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[87]] of 219</p>

<p>pleased. Otherwise, He will not be pleased. And the <em>mumukshus</em> see <em>Bhagavaan</em> only everywhere, with this understanding. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Varna aashrama iti | Aachaaravata iti atra aachaaragrahanam yajnyaadeh ****karmano api upalakshanam | **<em>Yajnyaas</em> and other <em>karmaas</em> are also included in this. These are all *Vishnu *<em>Aaraadhana</em> only. Everything told in the <em>Poorva Kaanda</em> of <em>Vedaas</em> is said to be <em>aaraadhana</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>. <em>Yajnyaas</em> and other <em>karmaas</em> are also included in this. These are all *Vishnu *<em>Aaraadhana</em> only. Everything told in the <em>Poorva Kaanda</em> of <em>Vedaas</em> is said to be <em>aaraadhana</em> of <em>Bhagavaan</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 10:  ****Yajan yajnyaan yajanti enam japati enam japan nrupa | ****Nighnan anyaan hinasti enam sarvabhooto yato harih || **Why is everything <em>Vishnu&rsquo;s aaraadhana</em> only? Whoever performs <em>yajnya, yajnya</em> is &quot; <em>yaja devapoojaayaam</em>&quot;; whichever god he worships, he will be worshipping <em>Vishnu</em> only, because &quot; <em>Sarvabhooto yato harih</em>&quot;. <em>Hari</em> is only everything, means that he is present as <em>antaryaami</em> of everything; everything is His <em>shareera</em>; He is <em>shareeri</em>. Everything is <em>Vishnu aatmaka, Bhagavadaatmaka</em>. Whoever worships any god ultimately worships <em>Bhagavaan</em> only, who is <em>antaryaami</em>. Any <em>japa</em> one does, he will be doing <em>japa</em> of <em>Vishnu</em> only. If one is killing others, he will be injuring Vishnu only. Therefore, one should not cause injury to others. Everything is <em>Vishnu</em> only. If he is worshipping through <em>yajnyaas</em>, he will only be worshipping *Sri Mahaa *<em>Vishnu</em>. Any <em>japa</em> he is doing, ultimately, he will be only doing <em>japa</em> of *Sri Mahaa *<em>Vishnu</em>. If he hurts someone also, he knows that he is hurting <em>Mahaa Vishnu</em> only. Because <em>Bhagavaan</em> is there everywhere, in every being, in every <em>devataa</em>. He is <em>antaryaami</em> of everyone. Because of this idea, a <em>mumukshu</em> is performing all the <em>karmaas</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Nanu varna aashrama dharmo yadi devataa vishayah katham asya bhagavat ****aaraadhanatvam iti atra aaha yajan iti | iti smruteh | **In <em>yajnyaas</em>, we see other deity&rsquo;s names only like *Soorya, Indra, Varuna, Agni, *<em>Soma</em>, etc. If it is all about <em>devataas</em>, how can it be <em>bhagavat aaraadhana</em>? This is explained in the commentary. <em>Varna aashrama dharma</em> is to do with <em>devataas</em>. How can it be <em>bhagavat aaraadhana</em>? **Sarva bhootah sarva aatma bhootah * ye yajanti pitruun devaan braahmanaan **<strong>sa hutaashanaan | Sarva bhoota antaraatmaanam vishnum eva yajanti te |</strong> He is inner self of everything.

If it is <em>vidhi poorvaka</em>, they will be worshipping directly the <em>antaryaami Paramaatman</em> only; and will get the ultimate benefit. But, even if they are worshipping other gods, they will be indirectly worshipping Me only. Everything is <em>Bhagavaan</em> is clearly told in many <em>pramaanaas</em>. If they are doing <em>yajnyaas</em> also, that will all become <em>Bhagavaan&rsquo;s aaraadhane</em> only, as He is <em>antaryaami</em> to everyone, <em>sarva bhoota antaraatmaa</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 11: ****Tasmaat sadaachaaravataa purushena janaardanah | ****Aaraadhyate sva varna ukta dharma anushthaana kaarinaa || **Just because it is told in the <em>Vedaas</em>, every <em>karma</em> one cannot perform.

One who is following the <em>shaastraas</em>, whatever is told for his <em>varna-aashrama</em>, that only he has to perform. <em>Sadaachaara</em> is the most important one.

To start with, in this <em>adhyaaya</em>, he is going to talk about the <em>varna dharmaas</em>. The <em>aashrama dharmaas</em> are going to be told in detail in the next chapter. <em>Sri Paraasharar</em> tells <em>Maitreyar</em> what he heard <em>Ourva rishi</em> telling <em>Sagara</em>. In the very beginning, <em>Ourva rishi</em> gives importance to practice of *varna aashrama *<em>dharma</em>, the duties of one&rsquo;s station in life. The four classes are told - <em>Braahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya</em> and <em>Shoodra</em>.

Being fully established in the <em>dharmaas</em>, the practices that are told - according to what is prescribed for their <em>dharmaas</em>, one should be following that only, and only then he has to worship <em>Vishnu</em>. Through all these <em>dharmaas</em>, he worships with the idea that this is all worship of <em>Vishnu</em> only.

Paaka</em> has meaning of <em>alpa</em>, little, small, as told in <em>Vaijayanti kosha</em>, means minor <em>yajnyaas</em>. **Vaishva devaadyaih namaskaara eka mantraih loukikaanaam paaka yajnya ****shabda iti aapastambah | * Namaskaarena mantrena pancha yajnyaat na ****haapayet * iti yaajnyavalkyah | **Like <em>Vaishvedeva</em>, and the mantra is only <em>&ldquo;namaha&rdquo;, namaskaara</em> only. It is told clearly in <em>Aapastamba Sutra</em> like this. That is why this is *paaka yajnya, alpa *<em>yajnya. Yaajnyavalkya</em> has told that even <em>Shoodraas</em> should not give up the *Pancha *<em>Mahaa yajnyaas</em>, they have to do only &quot; <em>namaha</em>&quot;. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 35:  ****Bhrutya aadi bharanaarthaaya sarveshaam cha parigrahah | **<strong>Rutu kaale abhigamanam sva daareshu maheepate ||</strong> From all the other <em>varnaas</em>, to support family and others, other dependents, he can receive from others. For <em>Shoodraas</em> also, <em>rutu kaala patni abhigamana</em> is told, as it <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[96]] of 219</p>

This is common to all the <em>varnaas</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 36: ****Dayaa samasta bhooteshu titikshaa naatimaanitaa | ****Satyam shoucham anaayaaso mangalam priyavaaditaa || **These are some <em>aatma gunaas</em> told for everybody. Compassion towards all beings, forbearance / tolerance, not being too proud, truthfulness, *shaastrokta shuddhi *- cleanliness as told in the <em>shaastraas</em>, not straining too much, establishing auspicious work, talking good always, &hellip; **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 37:  ****Maitree aspruhaa tathaa tadvat akaarpanyam nareshvara | **<strong>Anasooyaam cha saamaanyaa varnaanaam kathitaa gunaah ||</strong> &hellip; friendly disposition, not desiring others property, not being a miser, not finding fault in others, these are all the <em>aatma gunaas</em> very important for all the *varnaas - *<em>Braahmanaas, Kshatriyaas, Vaishyaas</em> and <em>Shoodraas</em>. <em>Asooyaa</em> is *gune doshatva buddhih *- finding fault in good quality in others.</p>

<p>**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 38: ****Aashramaanaam cha serveshaam ete saamaanya lakshanaah | ****Gunaan tathaa aapat dharmaan cha vipraadeenaam imaam shrunu || **These are all the <em>saamaanya lakshanaas</em> of the various <em>aashramaas</em>. Listen to me about the <em>Braahmana, Kshatriya</em> and other *varnaas *- what are the <em>aapat dharmaas</em>. In case they are not able to practice their own <em>varna dharmaas</em>, for various reasons, what they should do. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Aashramaanaam iti | Sarveshaam varnaanaam saadhaaranaah ||</strong> Though it is told as <em>aashramaanaam</em> here, it means <em>varna dharma</em> only. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 39:  ****Kshaatram karma dvijasyoktam vaishyakarma tathaa aapadi | **<strong>Raajanyasya cha vaishyoktam shoodra karma na cha etayoh ||</strong> So far, I have told you the general <em>dharmaas</em> prescribed for all the <em>varnaas</em>. In case they are not able to practice what is prescribed for their <em>varnaas</em>, those I will tell you now. A <em>Brahmin</em> can take up a <em>Kshatriya&rsquo;s dharmaas</em>. A <em>Kshatriya</em> can take a <em>Vaishya dharma</em>. A <em>Vaishya</em> can take up a <em>Shoodra dharma</em>.

<p>In case of difficulties, a <em>Braahmana</em> can take up a <em>Kshaastra karma</em>. A <em>Kshatriya</em> can take up a <em>Vaishya karma</em>. A <em>Vaishya</em> can take a <em>Shoodra karma</em>. A <em>Braahmana</em> and <em>Kshatriya</em> should never take a <em>Shoodra karma</em>.; this is not prescribed for them even in <em>aapat</em>, it is told. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 40: ****Saamarthye sati tat tyaajyam ubhaabhyaam api paarthiva | **<strong>Tat eva aapadi kartavyam na kuryaat karma sankaram ||</strong> Whatever is told as <em>aapat dharma</em>, is to be done only when <em>saamarthya</em> is not there. Whenever there is <em>saamarthya</em>, this <em>aapat dharma</em> is to be given up. When there is <em>aapat</em>, he has to do the other <em>dharmaas</em> only. When a <em>Brahmin</em> is in trouble and is not able to do <em>Braahmana dharma</em>, he can do <em>Kshatriya dharma</em>. But, again, if he gets back the capability, and is able to do <em>Braahmana dharma</em>, he has to give up the <em>aapat dharma</em>, and take up his *varna *<em>dharma</em>. Otherwise there will be <em>karma sankara</em>, it is told. When <em>saamarthya</em> is not there, then also if he does <em>Braahmana dharma</em>, then also it is <em>karma sankara</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Saamarthya iti | Ubhaabhyaam braahmana raajanyaabhyaam, saamarthye sati ****shaktou satyaam, tat - aapatkarma, tyaajyam | **For <em>Brahmins</em> and <em>Kshatriyaas</em>, when they are capable, then the <em>aapat karma</em> is to be given up; and he has to do his <em>mukhya kalpa</em> only. **Shaktasya anukalpa aashrayah, ashaktasya mukhya kalpa nibandhah cha karma **<strong>sankarah, vruttyoh vyatikaro vaa |</strong> For a <em>Brahmin, Braahmana dharma</em> is <em>mukhya kalpa</em>, and *Kshatriya *<em>dharma</em> is <em>anukalpa</em>. Only in <em>aapat</em>, he has to take up <em>Kshatriya dharma</em>; this is when he does not have the <em>saamarthya</em>. If he has <em>saamarthya</em>, then he should do <em>mukhya kalpa</em> only. When he has <em>saamarthya</em>, if he does <em>Kshatriya karma</em>; or when he does not have <em>saamarthya</em>, if he tries to do <em>mukha kalpa</em>, then both lead to <em>karma sankara</em>, it is told; it will be the wrong thing to do. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 41:  ****Iti ete kathitaa raajan varna dharmaa mayaa tava | **<strong>Dharmaan aashraminaam samyak bruvato me nishaamaya ||</strong> <em>Ourva Rishi</em> is telling *Sagara Raaja *- O King, I have told you now all the *varna <em><em>dharmaas</em>. Now, I will tell you <em>aashrama dharmaas</em>. Listen to me.
