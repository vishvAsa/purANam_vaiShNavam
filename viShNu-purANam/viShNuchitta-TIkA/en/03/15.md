In the same way, those who are not eligible is also going to be told. We will see this next. We are studying *Amsha* 3, Chapter 15, where *Ourva Rishi* is telling *Sagara* about *shraaddha karma*. To start with, he tells about who are the people who are to be invited for *nimantrana*, in *shraaddhaas*. A lot of options are given - *mukhya kalpa*, and *anukalpaas. Trinaachiketah, Trimadhu, Trisuparna, **Shadangavit, Vedavit, Shrotriyah, Yogee, Jyestha saamaga, Ritwik, Svastriya, **Douhitra, Jaamaatru, Shvashura, Maatula, Taponishtha, Panchaagni abhirata, **Shishyaa, Sambandhi*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 15, Shloka 5: ****Mitradhruk kunakhee kleebah shaavadantah tathaa dvija | ****Kanyaa dooshayitaa vanhi vedojjhah somavikrayee ||** These are all the people who are not to be invited for *shraaddha*. One who has cheated a friend, who has done droha to a mitra. One who is having twisted or crooked nails by birth itself. One who is a *napumsaka*. One who has black teeth, by nature - these kind of *Brahmins*. A *Brahmin* who has spoiled a girl. One who has given up *Agni*, or one who has given up *Vedaas*, without reason. One who sells soma *rasa*. An *Agnihotri* daily protects the *Agni*. But, if he takes *Sannyaasaashrama*, then he has to give up *Agnihotra*. In one place in the *Vedaas*, it says that it is not good to give up *Agni*. But, in another place, because *Sannyaasa* is also ordained, this is alright. But, without any reason, if one gives up *Agni*, or one gives up *Vedaas*, such a person should not be invited for *shraaddha*. *Soma lathe* has to be bought in exchange for a one-year old cow. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Mitradhruk iti | Nisargaat kunakhee krushnadantah cha | **By birth, one who has crooked nails. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 15, Shloka 6:  ****Abhishastah tathaa stenah pishunaa graamayaajakah | ****Bhrutakaadhyaapakah tadvat bhrutakaadhyaapitah cha yah ||** One who is rejected by society.
