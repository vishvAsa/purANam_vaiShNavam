pleased. Otherwise, He will not be pleased. And the *mumukshus * see *Bhagavaan * only everywhere, with this understanding. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Varna aashrama iti | Aachaaravata iti atra aachaaragrahanam yajnyaadeh ****karmano api upalakshanam | ***Yajnyaas * and other *karmaas * are also included in this. These are all *Vishnu **Aaraadhana * only. Everything told in the *Poorva Kaanda * of *Vedaas * is said to be *aaraadhana * of *Bhagavaan*. *Yajnyaas * and other *karmaas * are also included in this. These are all *Vishnu **Aaraadhana * only. Everything told in the *Poorva Kaanda * of *Vedaas * is said to be *aaraadhana * of *Bhagavaan*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 10:  ****Yajan yajnyaan yajanti enam japati enam japan nrupa | ****Nighnan anyaan hinasti enam sarvabhooto yato harih || **Why is everything *Vishnu's aaraadhana * only? Whoever performs *yajnya, yajnya * is " *yaja devapoojaayaam*"; whichever god he worships, he will be worshipping *Vishnu * only, because " *Sarvabhooto yato harih*". *Hari * is only everything, means that he is present as *antaryaami * of everything; everything is His *shareera*; He is *shareeri*. Everything is *Vishnu aatmaka, Bhagavadaatmaka*. Whoever worships any god ultimately worships *Bhagavaan * only, who is *antaryaami*. Any *japa * one does, he will be doing *japa * of *Vishnu * only. If one is killing others, he will be injuring Vishnu only. Therefore, one should not cause injury to others. Everything is *Vishnu * only. If he is worshipping through *yajnyaas*, he will only be worshipping *Sri Mahaa **Vishnu*. Any *japa * he is doing, ultimately, he will be only doing *japa * of *Sri Mahaa **Vishnu*. If he hurts someone also, he knows that he is hurting *Mahaa Vishnu * only. Because *Bhagavaan * is there everywhere, in every being, in every *devataa*. He is *antaryaami * of everyone. Because of this idea, a *mumukshu * is performing all the *karmaas*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Nanu varna aashrama dharmo yadi devataa vishayah katham asya bhagavat ****aaraadhanatvam iti atra aaha yajan iti | iti smruteh | **In *yajnyaas*, we see other deity's names only like *Soorya, Indra, Varuna, Agni, **Soma*, etc. If it is all about *devataas*, how can it be *bhagavat aaraadhana*?

How can it be *bhagavat aaraadhana*? **Sarva bhootah sarva aatma bhootah \* ye yajanti pitruun devaan braahmanaan ****sa hutaashanaan | Sarva bhoota antaraatmaanam vishnum eva yajanti te |** He is inner self of everything.

**eva kounteya yajanti avidhipoorvakam | iti \* gaavo hi dvija mukhyaah cha \* ****ityaadi cha |** Those who are devoted to other deities, like they want to worship only *Agni, **Varuna, Indra, Soma*, worshipping them with great *shraddhe*, they will also be worshipping Me only, indirectly. If it is *vidhi poorvaka*, they will be worshipping directly the *antaryaami Paramaatman * only; and will get the ultimate benefit. But, even if they are worshipping other gods, they will be indirectly worshipping Me only. Everything is *Bhagavaan * is clearly told in many *pramaanaas*. If they are doing *yajnyaas * also, that will all become *Bhagavaan's aaraadhane * only, as He is *antaryaami * to everyone, *sarva bhoota antaraatmaa*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 11: ****Tasmaat sadaachaaravataa purushena janaardanah | ****Aaraadhyate sva varna ukta dharma anushthaana kaarinaa || **Just because it is told in the *Vedaas*, every *karma * one cannot perform. Whatever is in their *varna * and *aashrama*, that only one has to perform. For each *varna * and *aashrama, karmaas * are told. Because something is *vaidika karma*, one cannot do, if it does not belong to his *varna * and *aashrama*. One who is following the *shaastraas*, whatever is told for his *varna-aashrama*, that only he has to perform. *Sadaachaara * is the most important one. One who is established in *sadaachaara*, he will be performing the worship of *Mahaavishnu*, according to following his *varna * and *aashrama dharmaas*. Many things are told in the *Vedaas*, but he has to follow what is told for his *varna * and his dharma. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 12:  ****Braahmanah kshatriyo vaishyah shoodrah cha pruthiveepate | ****Sva dharma tatparo vishnum aaraadhayati na anyathaa ||** *Braahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya * and *Shoodra*, being engaged in their *sva dharma*, that which belongs to their *varna * and *aashrama*, that is how they have to worship *Vishnu*, and not in any other way. Such a person should have all good qualities, they should give up all the bad qualities. This is going to be told in further *shlokaas*. We will see them next. Here onwards, the qualities which one should cultivate, and which one should give up, are going to be told. Further, the *varna aashrama dharmaas * are going to be told. We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 8, where *Paraasharar * is telling *Maitreyar * about the *Varna Aashrama dharmaas*. To start with, in this *adhyaaya*, he is going to talk about the *varna dharmaas*. The *aashrama dharmaas * are going to be told in detail in the next chapter. *Sri Paraasharar * tells *Maitreyar * what he heard *Ourva rishi * telling *Sagara*. In the very beginning, *Ourva rishi * gives importance to practice of *varna aashrama **dharma*, the duties of one's station in life. The four classes are told - *Braahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya * and *Shoodra*. Their *dharmaas*, whatever is told for their classes - the *Braahmana * has to follow the *Braahmana dharma, Kshatriya * has to follow the *Kshatriya dharma, *www.sadagopan.org  [[89]] of 219

*Vaishyaas * and *Shoodraas * also like this. Being fully established in the *dharmaas*, the practices that are told - according to what is prescribed for their *dharmaas*, one should be following that only, and only then he has to worship *Vishnu*. Through all these *dharmaas*, he worships with the idea that this is all worship of *Vishnu * only. These are some of the qualities that one has to inculcate, these are very important. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 13: ****Paraapavaadam paishunyam anrutam cha na bhaashate | ****Anya udvegakaram vaapi toshyate tena keshavah ||** Not abusing others, no calumny, no untruthfulness, nothing which creates stress for others, if one follows this, then only *Keshava * will be pleased. These are all the qualities that one has to do, and the *saamaanya dharmaas * that one has to practice. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 14: ****Paradaara paradravya parahimsaasu yo ratim | ****Na karoti pumaan bhoopa toshyate tena keshavah ||** He will not be interested in other's wives, or in other's possessions, or in hurting others, such a person only pleases Keshava. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 15: ****Na taadayati no hanti praanino na asat eehate | ****Yo manushyo manushyendra toshyate tena keshavah ||** He does not hurt others, he does not kill others, he does not desire or wish bad for others. Whoever such a person is there, he pleases *Keshava*, and *Keshava * is pleased by such a person.

Such a person treats all beings as he treats his own son or himself. He should always wish, desire good for them. One will not do bad, or hurt oneself; one will always do good for oneself; in a similar way, a person is also attached to one's son; he will do all good for his son; in the same way, he should treat every other being also. He should wish and do good for everyone, just as he does for his own son or himself. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 8, Shloka 18:  ****Yasya raaga aadi doshena na dushtam nrupa maanasam | ****Vishuddha chetasaa vishnuh toshyate tena sarvadaa ||** www.sadagopan.org  [[90]] of 219

One should not follow that which is outside the *shaastraas*, even if he has utmost *shraddhe*. This question is also answered by *Krishna * in *Bhagavad-Geeta*, when *Arjuna * asks - If a person has great *shraddhaa*, but does not do what is told in the *shaastraas*, what happens to him; *Krishna * says that this is not allowed, this is *ashaastram aasuram*, He says.
