Maayaamoha</em> went there and saw all the <em>asuraas</em> engaged in <em>tapas</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 2: ****Tato digambaro mundo barhipicchadharo dvija | ****Maayaamoho asuraan shlakshnam idam vachanam abraveet || **<em>Maayaamoha</em>, going as a <em>digambara</em>, not wearing any cloth, and shaving off his head, was wearing a peacock feather. He saw the <em>asuraas</em> and told them in a soft polished way, thus. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 3: ****Maayaamohah - ****He daityapatayo broota yadartham tapyate tapah | ****Ehikaartham nu paaratryam tapasah phalamicchatha || ***Maayaamoha *- O great leaders of the <em>daityaas</em>. Do tell me for what purpose are you doing this tapas. Are you interested in <em>aihika phalaas</em>, or *aamushmika **phalaas *(benefits of the world, or in liberation)? For what purpose are you doing this <em>tapas</em>? **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 4: ****Asuraah - ****Paaratra phala laabhyaaya tapashcharyaa mahaamate | **<strong>Asmaabhiriyamaarabdhaa him vaa te atra vivakshitam ||</strong> *Asuraas *- We are not interested in this <em>aihika phala</em>, we are interested in moksha itself. We want to get liberated. That is why we are doing this <em>tapas</em>. We have started the <em>tapas</em> for this purpose. What do you have to say in this matter. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 5:  ****Maayaamoha uvaachaa - ****Kurudhvam mama vaakyaani yadi muktim abheepsatha | **<strong>Arhadhvamenam dharmam cha mukti dvaaram asamvrutam ||</strong> <em>Maayaamoha</em> says - If you are desirous of attaining <em>moksha</em>, follow me, what I am going to say.

There is nothing which is superior to this. Being established in this <em>dharma</em>, that I am going to teach you, you can get liberated very easily. If you want to get <em>svarga</em> also, you can get. Or also, you can get <em>moksha</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Dharma iti | Atra eva - dharme | ****Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 7: ****Arhadhvam dharmetam cha sarve yooyam mahaabalaah || **Become worthy of this <em>dharma</em>, all of you, O powerful <em>asuraas</em>.

They leave the <em>Veda maarga</em>, and go away from what is told in the <em>Vedaas</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: ****Evam iti | Evam prakaaraih na etat yukti saham ityaadina vivarishyamaanaih | ****Yukti chodana charchitaih tarka aagama kruta vichaaraih | Yukti darshana ****tarkitaih iti paathe, yuktih yogyataa, darshanam pratyaksham, tarkitam tarkah **<strong>|</strong> There is another <em>paatha - yukti chodana charchitaih.

There is another *paatha yukti darshana *<em>tarkitaih</em>, where he discusses, explains to them, and completely overpowers them, and they start to believe him. They leave the path of <em>Vedaas</em> which they were following so far. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 9:  ****Dharmaaya etat adharmaaya sat etat na sat iti api | **<strong>Vimuktaye tu idam na etat vimuktim samprayacchati ||</strong> This is the <em>Arhata siddhaanta, Jaina siddhaanta</em> which is going to be told here.

This is also the dharma for those who wear many clothes. These are the seven *nayaas *- we can say it is there; in some other state, we cannot say that it is in this state only, because it undergoes modifications, keeps changing states; we cannot say that it is undergoing modification or not; we can say that it is there and not there also; or that it is there and we cannot say that it is there; or it is not there, and we cannot say that it is not there; they argue like this. These are also discussed in the <em>Brahma Sutraas</em>, and are refuted by the <em>Sootrakaara</em>. This is what is *anekaanta *<em>vaada</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 12: ****Iti anekaantavaadam cha maayaamohena naikadhaa | **<strong>Tena darshayataa daitaah svadharmam tyaajitaa dvija ||</strong> This is called <em>anekaanta vaada</em>.

Those who are not worshipping the gods, and those who are not serving the <em>atithis</em>, as told in the <em>shaastraas</em>, such persons company should be totally avoided by <em>saadhus</em>. They should not even talk to such people, should not spend time in their company, should not sit with them or anything. They are called <em>nagnaas</em>, and this is what *Sri *<em>Paraasharar</em> is explaining. Especially during <em>shraaddha</em>, when one is performing the <em>pitru karma</em>, with great devotion, one should be very careful and take all care to make sure that such a person called <em>nagna</em>, as explained in this chapter, should not be seen by the <em>Brahmins</em> who have been invited there by <em>nimantrana</em>, while they are having food; this is very harmful. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 50:  ****Anabhyarchya rusheen devaan pitru bhoota atitheen tathaa | ****Yo bhunkte tasya sallaapaat patanti narake naraah || **One who does not worship the <em>rishis, devaas, pitrus, bhootaas</em>, and also <em>atithis</em>, and offer them food and other things, and show respect, one who eats his food, or has conversation with him, they go to hell. <a href="https://www.sadagopan.org">www.sadagopan.org</a>  [[208]] of 219</p>

Talking with them, conversing with them, touching them, should never be done, should be given up completely. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 52:  ****Shraddhaavadbhih krutam yatnaat devaan pitru pitaamahaan | **<strong>Na preenayati tat shraadham yat ebhih avalokitam ||</strong> Even those who are having <em>shraddha</em> and all this, if a <em>Brahmin</em> or someone else looks at such a <em>nagna</em>, a person who has given up the <em>Vedic dharmaas</em>, during <em>shraaddha</em>, then the <em>pitru pitaamahaas, devaas</em>, they will never be pleased with what is offered to them in the <em>shraaddha</em>. If a person who is called a <em>nagna</em> comes in sight of them, then it will not please <em>pitrus</em> and <em>devaas</em> in <em>shraaddha</em>. So, <em>Paraasharar</em> is telling about who is a <em>nagna</em>, and related to this, there is a story coming next. We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 3, Chapter 18, where <em>Paraasharar</em> is explaining to <em>Maitreyar</em> the characteristics of one who is called a <em>nagna</em>, one who has given up the <em>varna aashrama dharmaas</em>, and is not following what is told in the <em>shaastraas</em>.</p>
