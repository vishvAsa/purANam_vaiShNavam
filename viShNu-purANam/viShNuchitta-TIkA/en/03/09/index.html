He has to follow all the aachaaraas as told by his varna dharma, and aashrama dharma for a Brahmachaari. He has to be established in pure aachaara. He has to do seva of Guru.

He has to live in the <em>Guru&rsquo;s</em> house, <em>aashrama</em>. Or <em>Guru</em> will do <em>upanayana</em> and teach him the <em>Vedaas</em>. A <em>Brahmachaari</em> has to be engaged in studying the <em>Vedaas</em> with a proper mind, in a focussed way. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 2: ****Shouchaachaaravataa tatra kaaryam shushrooshanam guroh | ****Vrataani charataa graahyo vedah cha krutabuddhinaa || **A <em>Brahmachaari</em> when he is living with a <em>Guru</em>, learning the <em>Vedaas</em>, has to do all kinds of service to the <em>Guru</em>. He has to follow all the <em>aachaaraas</em> as told by his <em>varna dharma</em>, and <em>aashrama dharma</em> for a <em>Brahmachaari</em>. He has to be established in pure <em>aachaara</em>.

<p>**Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Sthita iti | Aasati - aaseene gurou |</strong> When <em>Guru</em> is sitting, is <em>aasati</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 5: ****Tena eva uktah pathet vedam na anyachittah purasthitah | **<strong>Anujnyaatah cha bhikshaannam ashniyaat gurunaa tatah ||</strong> Sitting in front of the <em>Guru</em>, he has to listen to the <em>Guru</em>, do *aachaarya *<em>anuucchaarana. Aachaarya ucchaarana anu ucchaarana poorvaka</em>. Whatever <em>Guru</em> says, he has to repeat that. Sitting in front of him, and completely being focussed, he has to learn the <em>Vedaas</em>, not thinking of anything else. Taking the permission of Guru only, he has to get food and take that.; with Guru&rsquo;s permission only, he has to eat the food got through <em>bhikshaa</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 6: ****Avagaahet apah poorvam aachaaryena avagaahitaah | ****Samit jala aadikam cha asya kaalyam kaalyam upaanayet || **After the <em>Aachaarya</em> takes bath, in that same waters, he has to take bath. <em>Samit</em>, water, <em>darbha, pushpa</em> and others, he has to go everyday morning and collect these, and bring and give to his <em>Aachaarya</em>. **Sri Engal Aalwaan&rsquo;s Commentary: **<strong>Avagaahet iti | Kaalyam praatah |</strong> **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 7:  ****Gruheeta graahya vedah cha tato anujyaam avaapya cha | ****Gaarhastyam aavishet praajnyo nishpanna guru nishkrutih || **Whatever is to be learnt, after having learnt it, the <em>Vedaas</em> which are ordained to be learnt, and having taken the permission of the <em>Aachaarya</em>, he has to enter into <em>gruhasta aashrama</em>.

With meanings, it has more value. He has to learn with respect to his <em>shaakhaa</em>, this is <em>svaadhyaaya</em>. There is a <em>vidhi</em> in <em>Taittiriya</em>. If he simply learnt the <em>Vedaas</em> without knowing the meaning, then he is only carrying a big burden on his head just like a weight kept on a pillar. One who has learnt with the meanings, he will get all good. He will go to <em>svarga</em>, having got rid of all the sins. <em>Nishkruti</em> is <em>guru dakshinaa</em>.</p>

<p>These are the <em>dharmaas</em> for <em>Brahmachaari aashrama</em>. Next the *Gruhasta aashrama *<em>dharmaas</em>, which we see next. We are studying <em>Amsha</em> 3, Chapter 9, where <em>Ourva Rishi</em> is teaching <em>Sagara</em>, and this is being told by <em>Paraasharar</em> to <em>Maitreyar</em>. After knowing about *varna *<em>dharmaas</em>, King <em>Sagara</em> asks about <em>Aashrama dharmaas</em>. We had seen how a <em>Brahmachaari</em> should lead his life. After doing <em>upanayana</em>, he has to stay with a <em>Guru</em> and learn the <em>Vedaas</em>, and he has to follow all the <em>vidhis</em> and <em>nishedhaas</em> which are told, as per the <em>shaastraas</em>. He has to do all kinds of service to his <em>Guru</em>. He has to study whenever he has time. He has to do his <em>nitya karmaas</em>, and has to follow his <em>aachaarya</em> in every possible way, and should not do anything negative. First the <em>aachaarya</em> takes bath, and in the same waters, the <em>Brahmachaari</em> should take bath. He has to go to the forest nearby, and get the <em>samit, jala, kusha</em>, etc., whatever is required by the <em>aachaarya</em> for his daily duties. After having completed his studies, he should take the permission of his <em>Guru</em> and enter <em>gruhasta aashrama</em>, having given the <em>Gurudakshinaa</em>. Now, <em>Ourva Rishi</em> continues to tell about the <em>gruhasta aashrama</em>. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 8: ****Vidhinaa avaapta daarah tu dhanam praapya sva karmanaa | ****Gruhastha kaaryam akhilam kuryaat bhoopaala shaktitah || **As per the <em>vidhi</em> told in the <em>Shrutis</em> and <em>Smrutis</em>, one has to accept a wife and get married.
