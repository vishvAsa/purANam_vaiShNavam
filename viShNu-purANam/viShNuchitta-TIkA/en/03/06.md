Kaashyapa* and others created three *samhitaas, *. The fourth one *Vyaasa* condensed it based on the three samhitaas created by kaashapa and other, into another one called *Romaharshanikaa*. It is so called becaus it was studied by Romaharshana and taught to his shishyas. Romaharshana and Ugrashravas, by both of them it was told to Shaunaka and others. As told in Maatsya purana – ‘Consisting of four lakh slokas this was taught by Vyaasa who has achieved wonders. It was taught to my father and my father taught it to me and I am telling you’. Thus The Puranas are divided into four in Kali Yuga and all of them have the rools in them. They are having different paathaas just like veda shaakhaas as told in Vayu Purana. In Kaurma Purana, this division of kaurma purana itself is told by itself thus – ‘this is the sacred Kaurma Purana which is the 15th one. Divided into four based on the division of samhitas’.

In all the *Puraanaas, Vishnu* is said to be the Creator. Not only Creation, but also dissolution. None other than *Vishnu* does the creation and dissolution. *Puraanaas* are *upabrahmanaas* of the *Shrutis*; they explain in more detail the meanings established in the *Shrutis*; they do *vishadeekarana, upabrahmana*. In the *Vedaas*, it is established that one who does creation, sustenance and dissolution, is none other than *Mahaavishnu. **Yato vaa imaani bhootaani jaayante, yena jaataani jeevanti, yah prayanti **abhisamvishanti* is from *Taittiriyopanishad.

All these culminate in the specific term *Naaraayana*, as told in *Subaalopanishad*. He is the sole creator, and is responsible for sustenance and dissolution of all the worlds.

Rishis* and others who have studied and understood all the *Vedaas*, have directly perceived the meanings established in those *Vedaas*, and have told in their own words - these are the *Puraanaas*. One who studies the *Vedaas* without the support of *Upabrahmanaas, Vedaas* are scared of them because it is said that *Vedaas* say that this person is going to cheat me; he has not understood the meanings of the *Vedaas*, has studied without the support of *Upabrahmanaas. Upabrahmanaas* have to be used in order to understand the meanings of the *Vedaas*. In these, *Itihaasaas* and *Puraanaas* are told. *Itihaasaas* are combined inside the *Puraanaas*, as in the 14 *Vidyaasthaanaas, Itihaasaas* are not mentioned. These 14 are called *Dharma vidyaa sthaanaas*. 



*Puraanaas* are *upabrahmana* to *Vedaas*, and are responsible for establishing *dharmaas*. One can know the *dharmaas*, understand the *dharmaas* by studying the *Puraanaas*. These 14 are called *Dharma Vidyaa sthaanaas*. These are all accessories to studying *Vedaas*. 



*Bhaashyakaarar* has given definition of *upabrahmana* in *Sribhaashya. **Upabrahmanam naama vidita sakala veda tat arthaanaam sva yoga mahima **saakshaatkruta veda tattvaarthaanaam sva vaakyaih sva avagata vedaartha **vyakteekaranam |* Those who have studied all the *Vedaas*, and their meanings in totality, and who have done the *saakshaatkaara* through their own *yoga*, who have perceived directly the *tattvaas* which are established in the *Vedaas*, in their own words, sentences, they have actually seen, done *saakshaatkaara*, and have told in their own words, this is called *Upabrahmana*, This is according to the *Vedaas* only. One has to understand the meanings of the *Vedaas* along with www.sadagopan.org  [[64]] of 219

the *Upapuraanaas* only. 



*Meemaamsaa* is one *shaastra*. This is where *Bhaashyakaarar* establishes the *aikashaastrya* of *Meemaamsaa. Meemaamsa* is a *vyaakhyaana* on the *Vedaas. **Vedaas* have got two parts -*Poorvakaanda/Karmakaanda* and *Uttarakaanda/Jnyanaakaanda. Jaimini rishi* has written the meanings of the *Poorvakaanda* in the form of *Sootraas; Jaimini* is also a student of *Baadaraayanar. Baadaraayanar* teaches *Jaimini* the *Saamaveda* and he continues to teach to his students. The meanings of the *Uttarakaanda* are explained in the form of *Sootraas* by *Krishnadvaipaayanar / Vyaasar / **Baadaraayanar*, who is also the creator of these 18 *Puraanaas*. This is told as *aikashaastrya*, one *shaastra* only, that there are 2 chapters of the same book. This is told as one word *Meemaamsa*, and not as two words, as they are same *shaastra*. 



*Nyaayavistara* is by *Goutama Rishi*. 



The *Dharmashaastraas* establish the meaning of the *Karmakaanda. **Puraanaas* establish the meanings of the *Uttarakaanda. Itihaasa* is also embedded in *Puraana* itself.

Gaandharva* is about *geetha shaastra. **Arthashaastra* is about *dandaneeti, Dhanurveda* is about *astraas*. These are said to be *Upavedaas. Vyjayanti grantha* is telling about this. 



Whereas *Vedaas* and others talk about creation and other things which we cannot see here, and what we attain at a later time, in another birth.

One unit of eternal *Veda* was there, but all these branches were created, which are divided, subdivided, etc. It became a huge forest like a tree with innumerable branches. I have so far told you how it happened. 



**Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Iti iti | Bheda hetuh manushyaanaam balaadi alpatvam | **What is the reason why these branches were created?

Now, whatever is being studied, are studied with a different version, in various *Dvaapara yugaas*, and gives a feeling that they are *anitya*. If they are *nitya*, how can there be *paathaantaraas, **shaakhaantaraas*, etc. In one it says *Vijnyaane tishthan*, in another it says *Aatmani **tishthan*.

they are eternal. But there are so many branches with so many variations in the *paathaas*. They look like *anitya*, but in totality there are one only. There may be a difference in which portion of which *shaakhaa* is being studied, because people may be studying different *shaakhaas*. In each *manvantara*, different *shrutis* are being studied. Based on that, in various parts itself, different *shrutis* are being practiced, this does not make *Vedaas* as *anitya*, because in totality, it is eternal.
