Aachaarya ucchaarana anu ucchaarana poorvaka*. Whatever *Guru* says, he has to repeat that.

Taking the permission of Guru only, he has to get food and take that.; with Guru's permission only, he has to eat the food got through *bhikshaa*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 6: ****Avagaahet apah poorvam aachaaryena avagaahitaah | ****Samit jala aadikam cha asya kaalyam kaalyam upaanayet || **After the *Aachaarya* takes bath, in that same waters, he has to take bath. *Samit*, water, *darbha, pushpa* and others, he has to go everyday morning and collect these, and bring and give to his *Aachaarya*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Avagaahet iti | Kaalyam praatah |** **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 7:  ****Gruheeta graahya vedah cha tato anujyaam avaapya cha | ****Gaarhastyam aavishet praajnyo nishpanna guru nishkrutih || **Whatever is to be learnt, after having learnt it, the *Vedaas* which are ordained to be learnt, and having taken the permission of the *Aachaarya*, he has to enter into *gruhasta aashrama*.

If he simply learnt the *Vedaas* without knowing the meaning, then he is only carrying a big burden on his head just like a weight kept on a pillar.

These are the *dharmaas* for *Brahmachaari aashrama*. Next the *Gruhasta aashrama **dharmaas*, which we see next. We are studying *Amsha* 3, Chapter 9, where *Ourva Rishi* is teaching *Sagara*, and this is being told by *Paraasharar* to *Maitreyar*. After knowing about *varna **dharmaas*, King *Sagara* asks about *Aashrama dharmaas*. We had seen how a *Brahmachaari* should lead his life. After doing *upanayana*, he has to stay with a *Guru* and learn the *Vedaas*, and he has to follow all the *vidhis* and *nishedhaas* which are told, as per the *shaastraas*. He has to do all kinds of service to his *Guru*. He has to study whenever he has time. He has to do his *nitya karmaas*, and has to follow his *aachaarya* in every possible way, and should not do anything negative. First the *aachaarya* takes bath, and in the same waters, the *Brahmachaari* should take bath. He has to go to the forest nearby, and get the *samit, jala, kusha*, etc., whatever is required by the *aachaarya* for his daily duties. After having completed his studies, he should take the permission of his *Guru* and enter *gruhasta aashrama*, having given the *Gurudakshinaa*. Now, *Ourva Rishi* continues to tell about the *gruhasta aashrama*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 8: ****Vidhinaa avaapta daarah tu dhanam praapya sva karmanaa | ****Gruhastha kaaryam akhilam kuryaat bhoopaala shaktitah || **As per the *vidhi* told in the *Shrutis* and *Smrutis*, one has to accept a wife and get married.

the *bhoota ganaas*. These are all told in the *shaastraas*. One who is following all of these, with his own duties which are told as per the *shaastras*, performing all of this regularly, he will get all good benefits, and will enjoy in all the *lokaas*, as the *phala*. *Vaatsalya* is *dosha adarshitva*, not looking at the defects in others. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Bhootaani iti | Nija karma samaarjitaan sveeya karma saadhitaan ****praajaapatyaadeen | \* Sarva ete punya lokaah bhavanti \* iti shrutou, \* ya etaan ****avyagro yathaa upadesham kurute nitya svargah prushtah cha \* iti smrutou cha ****nityaanaam pratyavaaya vyatirekam phalaantarasya cha ukteh |** He will take *praajaapatya loka* and the *phalaas* are told for these *karmaas* also. Those who do all these get *punya lokaas*, and enjoy there, it is told. He will get *svarga*. He will avoid *pratyavaaya* if he does *nitya naimittika karmaas*. He will not be punished by *Bhagavaan* for not doing these. *Vedaas* prescribe the *nitya **naimittika karmaas*, which if one does not do, they will be subjected to punishment, they will have to suffer because of transgressing the *shaastraas*. Some of them, if done, there are some benefits also. If someone is interested in doing that, they can get those *lokaas* and enjoy there. This is also told. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 11: ****Bhikshaa bhujah cha ye kechit parivraat brahmachaarinah | ****Te api atra eva pratishthante gaarhastyam tena vai param || **There are some *Brahmins* who live only by taking alms from others, *bhikshe*; some of them are *Brahmachaaris* and they also have *gruhasthaashrama* as the *aashraya **\(Gruhasthaas* provide them all the support, as they are always depending on *bhikshaa* for living; they go from place to place, supported by *gruhasthaas*\). This is why *gruhasthaashrama* is said to be a good *aashrama*, where they support the other *aashramaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 12: ****Vedaaharana kaaryaaya teertha snaanaaya cha prabho | ****Atanti vasudhaam vipraah pruthivee darshanaaya cha ||** These *Brahmins*, in order to learn the *Vedaas*, go from place to place, from one *aachaarya* to another *aachaarya*, to learn. To perform *teertha snaana*, they visit all *teertha kshetraas*. They go around all places on the earth. They go around to see the *punya kshetraas*. They don't stay in one place. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 13:  ****Aniketaa hi anaahaaraa yatra saayam gruhaah cha ye | ****Teshaam gruhasthah sarveshaam pratishthaa yonireva cha ||** They don't have a house, a place to live.

They may move the next day, or after two days. The *gruhasthaas* who are in those places, they provide the food and shelter to such people. *Gruhasthaas* are the ones who support, they are called as *pratishthaa*. Because they provide food, they are said to be *yoni*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 14: ****Teshaam svaagata daanaadi vaktavyam madhuram nrupa | ****Gruha aagataanaam dadyaat cha shayana aasana bhojanam ||** Whenever a *gruhastha* sees such a person, a *parivraat* or *Brahmachaari*, roaming around like this, with the objective of learning the *Vedaas, teertha snaanaas*, when such people come, they have to be well treated and respected. They have to be looked after very well by *gruhasthaas*. They have to welcome the *Brahmachaaris* with nice words. Whoever comes, they have to be given a good place to rest, stay, and food has to be provided by the *gruhasthaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 15: ****Atithih yasya bhagnaasho gruhaat pratinivartate | ****Sa dattvaa dushkrutam tasmai punyam aadaaya gacchati ||** If an *atithi* is not happy with the service provided by a *gruhastha*, it will be very bad for the *gruhastha*. All the *paapaas* will come to this *gruhastha*, and all the *punyaas* which the *gruhastha* had accumulated will go to that *atithi*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 16: ****Avajnyaanam ahamkaaro dambhah cha eva gruhe satah | ****Paritaapa upaghaatou cha paarushyam cha na shasyate || **Disrespecting them, being too proud with respect to them, showing off that they are doing something great, having given something and then repenting, hurting them, telling harsh words towards them - all these things if they do in front of an *atithi*, these are all not *shaasana*, not *vidhi*.

Whatever is told for each *varna*, that, *nitya karmaas* and such things if one does not do, they will get *pratyavaaya*, undergo some punishment by *Bhagavaan* because of transgressing the *vidhis* of the *Vedaas*. By following all of these, they will avoid all such *pratyavaayaas*. If *pratyavaaya* comes, they cannot attain those *lokaas *- these *pratibandhaas* will not be there when one follows all these things. *Vaanaprastha aashrama* is going to be told now. *Brahmacharya* was told. *Gruhastha aashrama* was told where *atithi satkaara* was told in detail, and the *nitya naimittika karmaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 18: ****Vayah parinatou raajan krutakrutyo gruhaashramee | ****Putreshu bhaaryaam nikshipya vanam gacchet sahaiva vaa || **One who is a *gruhasta*, when he becomes old, having done all the *gruhasta **dharmaas* properly, he has to make his sons take care of his wife, and has to go to the forest; or he can also take his wife along with him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 19: ****Parna moola phala aahaarah keshashmashru jataadharah | ****Bhoomishaayee bhavet tatra munih sarvaartha nispruhah ||** Having gone to the forest, he has to live on what is available there - the leaves of the plant, the roots, fruits. This itself is the food for him in the forest. He has to grow the hair and moustache and beard. He has to sleep on the ground itself.

*Atithi* means there is no specific *tithi* on which he comes. He can come any time, any day, uninvited guest. One who comes for a *dharma kaarya*, one who is a new *atithi*, who has not come earlier - all others are *abhyaagataas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 22: ****Vanya snehena gaatraanaam abhyangah cha asya shasyate | ****Tapah cha tasya raajendra sheeta ushna aadi sahishnutaa || **He has to live with the material and other things available there only in the forest - his food, clothes, sleeping on the ground. In the same way, oil used for bath, is also what is grown in the forest. He has to do tapas of the form of tolerating the cold and heat. This itself becomes tapas for him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 23: ****Yah tu etaam niyatah charyaam vaanaprasthah charet munih | ****Sa dahati agnivat doshaan jayet lokaan cha shaashvataan || **A *muni* who performs all these things, regularly without breaking, as described in the *shaastraas*, he will burn all his defects, as though the fire burns everything.

A *brahmavit* is told in the next *shloka*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 9, Shloka 33:  ****Mokshaashramam yah charate yathaa uktam shuchih susankalpita buddhi ****yuktah | ****Anindhanam jyotiriva prashaantah sa brahma lokam shrayate dvijaatih || **This is *vidvat vishaya*, about a *brahmavit*. *Mokshaashrama* is the *sannyaasa **aashrama*, as it is the path for attaining *moksha*. Being calm, *shaanta* like the *jyoti* which is without any firewood, he is also *shaanta* like that. He is most peaceful and established in *Brahman*. He will get *moksha*. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Moksha aashramam iti | Mokshaashramam paarivraajyam, su sankalpita buddhi ****yuktah samyak sampaadita buddhi yoga yuktah | Lokyate iti lokah, brahma eva ****loko brahma lokah, brahmano loka iti vaa vigrahah |** Having got that kind of a b *uddhi yoga*. This is also explained in the *Brhuadaaranyaka Upanishad - "Brahma loka samraat iti yaajnyavalkyah", **Brahman* itself is told as *Brahma loka*. Or it can be *Paramapada* itself. **Dvijaatih iti viprasya eva samnyaase adhikaara uktih |** *Brahmin* only has *adhikaara* for *sannyaasa*. **\* Gatih turya aashrame naasti baahuja oorujayoh kachit | Turyaashrame gatih ****proktaa mukhajaanaam svayambhuvaa | iti dattaatreya ukteh |** *Sri Engal Aalwaan* quotes from *Dattaatreya Puraana. Turiya aashrama* is the fourth *aashrama*, the *sannyaasa aashrama*. This is not there for one who is born of arms, and one born of thighs. Those who are born of *mukha*, only for them *sannyaasa aashrama* is told - only for *Brahmins. Braahmano asya mukham **aaseet, baahoo raajanyah krutah, ooro tat asya yat vaishyah, padbhyaam shoodro **ajaayata. Mukhaja* is *Braahmana. Baahuja* is *Kshatriya. Ooruja* is *Vaishya. Tureeya **aashrama* is not told for Kshatriya and Vaishya. This concludes Chapter Nine of *Amsha* 3.** ****|| Iti Sri Vishnu Puraane Truteeye Amshe Navamo Adhyaayah || ****|| Iti Sri Vishnu Chitteeye Vishnu Puraana Vyaakhyaane Truteeye Amshe ****Navamo Adhyaayah || **www.sadagopan.org  [[108]] of 219
