It cannot be said that it is like this, and it can be very clearly said to be like this also. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 11: ****Dik vaasa saamayam dharmo dharmo ayam bahuvaasasam ||** This is the *dharma * of those who don't wear any clothes, *digambaraas*. This is also the dharma for those who wear many clothes. These are the seven *nayaas *- we can say it is there; in some other state, we cannot say that it is in this state only, because it undergoes modifications, keeps changing states; we cannot say that it is undergoing modification or not; we can say that it is there and not there also; or that it is there and we cannot say that it is there; or it is not there, and we cannot say that it is not there; they argue like this. These are also discussed in the *Brahma Sutraas*, and are refuted by the *Sootrakaara*. This is what is *anekaanta **vaada*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 12: ****Iti anekaantavaadam cha maayaamohena naikadhaa | ****Tena darshayataa daitaah svadharmam tyaajitaa dvija ||** This is called *anekaanta vaada*.

He teaches *Aarhata mata, Bouddha mata*, and also *Chaarvaaka mata * to all the *asuraas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 17: ****Svargaartham yadi vo vaanchaa nirvaanaartham atha asuraah | ****Tat alam pashu ghaata aadi dushta dharmaih nibodhata ||** O *daityaas*, if you have desire to attain *svarga*, or you want to attain *moksha*, get proper knowledge and be enlightened, and give up these *Veda **dharmaas * where *pashu ghaata * are told, which are all full of *himsaa*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 18: ****Vijnyaanamayam eva etat ashesham avagacchata | ****Ghudhyadhvam me vachah samyak budhiah evam iha uditam ||** This is called *aatma khyaati paksha*, there are many *khyaati vaadaas*. They are called *yogaachaaraas*. One of the four groups of *Bouddhaas * say that everything is *vijnyaana * only. In a dream, there are no objects really there, but knowledge itself takes the form of all the objects we see in the dream; in the same way, what we see in this world also, everything is not real, and is only knowledge that is taking this form of consciousness, or *vijnyaana*, and is appearing in various forms that we see. Everything that we see outside is all *vijnyaana * only, it has taken form like that, is what they argue. Think properly and understand, and get proper knowledge, from what I am teaching you. This is what is taught by enlightened people. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Vijnyaanamayam iti | Tatra vijnyaanamayam iti yogaachaaraanam aatma ****khyaati paksha uktih | ****Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 19:  ****Jagat etat anaadhaaram bhraanti jnyaana artha tatparam | ****Raagaadi dushtam atyartham bhraamyate bhava sankate || **This is another group of *maadhyamikaas*, who propose *shoonya khyaati*, everything is *shoonya*. Like when we say *rajju sarpa jnyaana*, we get knowledge of *sarpa * in *rajju*, a serpent is seen in a rope. The serpent is not really there, but the rope appears like a serpent, and we get scared. When someone comes and says that it is not a serpent, but a rope, the fear goes off, and we get the right knowledge. The rope is there, and on the rope, we get the serpent knowledge; the imagination of serpent happens. Serpent is not really there. Rope is the *adhishthaana* on which the appearance of the serpent happens. But, what www.sadagopan.org  [[201]] of 219

the *maadhyamikaas*, *shoonyavaadis, shoonya khyaati paksha * persons say is that the rope is also not there, rope is also *bhrame*; this is called *niradhishthaana **bhrame; adhishthaana * is also not real, it is also *bhrame*. They say that there is no *aadhaara, adhishthaana * for this world. Having the defects of desire, hatred, the beings of the world are roaming around \(coming and going again and again\) in this *samsaara that * is most painful. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Jagat iti | Jagat etat anaadhaaram iti niradhishthaanou bhraanti jnyaana tat ****arthou iti maadhmaikaanaam shoonyakhyaati paksha uktih |** Knowledge that appears as objects, and also the knowledge - both are *bhrame * only, is what they say. This is the *shoonya khyaati*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 20: ****Evam budhyata budhyadhvam budhyata evam ateerayan | ****Maayaamohah sa daiteyaan dharmam atyaajan nijam ||** He keeps telling - Be enlightened, get the right knowledge, *samyak jnyaana*. He makes those *asuraas * also give up their real *dharma*, which they were following. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Evam iti | Budhyateh aavruttih bouddhatva niruktatyarthaa |** The *bouddha mata * is what is being told. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 21: ****Naanaaprakaara vachanam sa teshaam yukti yojitam | ****Tathaa tathaa avadat dharmam tatyajuh te yathaa yathaa || **He told the same thing in many many ways, using different different logic, various kinds of logic. In such ways that they gave up everything. He taught dharma in different ways, so that they gave up everything. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 22: ****Te api anyeshaam tathaa eva oochuh anyaih anye tathaa uditaah | ****Maitreya tat yajurdharmam veda smruti uditam param || **This also spread.

He taught everything that is opposed to what is taught in the *Vedaas*. He started to delude them with this kind of teaching. His words and logic were so pleasing, so convincing, that everyone started to follow him. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 24:  ****Svalpena eva hi kaalena maayaamohena te asuraah | **www.sadagopan.org  [[202]] of 219

What is told in the *Veda * elsewhere is that "You should not cause *himsaa * to any being" - *Na **himsyaat sarvaa bhootaani*. When it is told like this, what they are doing is all *himsaa*, it is against the *Vedaas*; the logic is not reasonable, he said. The *Vedaas* also say that offering a *pashu * as *bali * in *yajnya*, leads to *dharma *- how can this be reasonable, he started arguing. It is also said that if you offer *havis * through *Agni*, and *aajyaa*, ghee, it will all get burnt in the fire - how can it give some *phala * at a later time - this is all childish talk, he said. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Na iti | Adharmamayee himsaa dharmaaya cheshyate iti vaakyam niryuktikam | ****Neshyate iti paathe etat agnishomeeya pashu himsaa vidhi vaakyam na yukti ****saham | Yato \* Na himsyaat sarvaa\(ni\) bhootaani \* iti shrutyaa eva himsaa ****dharmaaya neshyate | ***Himsaa * will lead to *dharma*, is told in the *Vedaas *- this is not reasonable.

In another place, it says we have to offer a *pashu*, that is *dharma*. *Maayaamoha * started arguing like this. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 27:  ****Yajnyaih anekaih devatvam avaapya indrena bhujyate | ****Shamyaadi yadi chet kaashtham tat varam patrabhuk pashuh || **One who performed a lot of *yajnyaas*, and became a god, attained *devatva*. Becoming a god, *Indra * enjoys all the pleasures in his *svarga*, because he has done lot of *yajnyaas*, and has attained that position. What does he eat? *Samit * and other dry sticks that are offered. If that is what he eats after doing all the *yajnyaas*, after attaining that position, then the animals which eat the fresh leaves, they are much better compared to Indra. This is what he said. So, *Indratva* is of no use. **Sri Engal Aalwaan's Commentary: ****Yajnyaih iti | Shamyaadi iti | Tadvaram svargam gatvaa api sankataka ****shamyaadi kaashtha bhakshakaat tasmaat indraat mrudu tat patram iha eva **www.sadagopan.org  [[203]] of 219

If you offer *pashu * as *bali * in *yajnya*, it is said that it goes and attains *svarga phala*. If that *pashu * which is offered as *bali * in *yajnya*, attains higher and superior worlds, why can't the *yajamaana * offer his father himself as *pashu * in the *yajnya*? Does he not want his father to attain *svarga*, to enjoy superior worlds?

If he leaves *nitya karma * for one paksha, he has to do some great *praayaschitta*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 41: ****Samvatsaram kriyaa heenah yasya pumso abhijaayate | ****Tasya avalokanaat sooryo nireekshyah saadhubhih sadaa ||** If one gives up *nitya karmaas * for a full year; a *saadhu*, who is properly established in *Veda dharmaas*, if he sees a person who has given up *nitya karmaas * for one full year, then that person has to see the Sun to become pure again, because by seeing such a person itself, he will become a sinner. By seeing the Sun, he can get rid of that *paapa*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 42: ****Sprushte snaanam sachelam syaat shuddheh hetuh mahaamate | ****Pumso bhavati tasya uktaa na shuddhih paapa karmanah ||** If anyone touches such a person who has given up *nitya karma * for a year, he has to do a *sachela snaana, snaana * with the clothes that he is wearing, in order to become pure.

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 46: ****Atha bhunkte gruhe tasya karoti aasyaam tathaa aasane | ****Shete chaapi eka shayane sa sadyah sah tamo bhavet ||** If he sits along with him in the same seat, and eats along with him in his house, who does not follow the *nitya karmaas*, and sleeps along with him, he will immediately become a sinner equal to the other person. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 47: ****Devataa pitru bhootaani tathaa anabhyarchya yah atitheen | ****Bhunkte sa paatakam bhunkte nishkrutih tasya neshyate ||** One who has food without offering and without worshipping the *devataas, pitrus, **bhootaas*, or also *atithis*, he eats sin itself. There is no *praayaschitta * for such a person. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 48: ****Braahmanaadyaah tu ye varnaah svadharmaat anyato mukhaah | ****Yaanti te nagna sanjyaam tu heena karmasu avasthitaah || ***Braahmanaas * and others who are not following their *varna dharmaas*, according to their *varna * and *aashrama*, and have turned away from the *dharmaas * that are ordained for their *varnaas*, they will also be called as *nagnaas * only. Because they are established in doing *karmaas * which are against what is taught in the *Vedaas*. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 49: ****Chaturnaam yatra varnaanaam maitreya atyanta sankarah | ****Tatra asyaa saadhu vrutteenaam upaghaataaya jaayate ||** Where there is *varna saankarya*, mixing up of one *varna * with another, by marriage, etc., those who are doing such things, they destroy the *saadhu vruttis*, establishment in the righteous path. A person who is following the *shaastraas*, who is a *saadhu * should totally avoid such company and places where *varna saankarya * happens. Those who are not worshipping the gods, and those who are not serving the *atithis*, as told in the *shaastraas*, such persons company should be totally avoided by *saadhus*. They should not even talk to such people, should not spend time in their company, should not sit with them or anything. They are called *nagnaas*, and this is what *Sri **Paraasharar * is explaining. Especially during *shraaddha*, when one is performing the *pitru karma*, with great devotion, one should be very careful and take all care to make sure that such a person called *nagna*, as explained in this chapter, should not be seen by the *Brahmins * who have been invited there by *nimantrana*, while they are having food; this is very harmful. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 50:  ****Anabhyarchya rusheen devaan pitru bhoota atitheen tathaa | ****Yo bhunkte tasya sallaapaat patanti narake naraah || **One who does not worship the *rishis, devaas, pitrus, bhootaas*, and also *atithis*, and offer them food and other things, and show respect, one who eats his food, or has conversation with him, they go to hell. www.sadagopan.org  [[208]] of 219

**Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 51: ****Tasmaat etaan naro nagnaan trayeen santyaaga dooshitaan | ****Sarvadaa varjayet praajnyah aalaapah sparshanaadishu || **One has to always not converse with such a person, a *nagna * who is against the *Vedaas*, not following the *Vedic dharmaas*, doing everything against what is taught in the *Vedaas*, they have the defect of the form of giving up the *Vedic **dharmaas*; one should always never mix with them at all. Talking with them, conversing with them, touching them, should never be done, should be given up completely. **Sri Vishnu Puraana, Amsha 3, Chapter 18, Shloka 52:  ****Shraddhaavadbhih krutam yatnaat devaan pitru pitaamahaan | ****Na preenayati tat shraadham yat ebhih avalokitam ||** Even those who are having *shraddha * and all this, if a *Brahmin * or someone else looks at such a *nagna*, a person who has given up the *Vedic dharmaas*, during *shraaddha*, then the *pitru pitaamahaas, devaas*, they will never be pleased with what is offered to them in the *shraaddha*. If a person who is called a *nagna * comes in sight of them, then it will not please *pitrus * and *devaas * in *shraaddha*. So, *Paraasharar * is telling about who is a *nagna*, and related to this, there is a story coming next. We are studying *Amsha * 3, Chapter 18, where *Paraasharar * is explaining to *Maitreyar * the characteristics of one who is called a *nagna*, one who has given up the *varna aashrama dharmaas*, and is not following what is told in the *shaastraas*. 



In order to show how harmful it can be, *Paraasharar * starts to relate a story.

This king had a *Dhanurveda aachaarya*, who was teaching him the *dhanurveda*. That person, the *paashandi * who was approaching them, was this *aachaarya's * friend.

Because they were observing the *upavaasa vrata*, the *vrata * of fasting, she did not speak to him, though the king spoke to him. After seeing him, she saw the Sun.
