 [[1]] Sri Krishnaya Parabrahmane Namaha Sreemathe Ramanujaya Namaha 



**Sri Vishnu Puraana** 



Offering our *pranaamams* to Mahamahopaadhyaya Dr. N S Anantharangacharya Swamin, and to Maha Vidwaan Sri V T Tirunaarayana Iyengar Swamin, and all the *Aachaaryaas*, with whose grace we are blessed to be part of such *kainkaryam*. Offering our *pranaamams * to all the *Bhaagavataas * in this *Satsanga*. 



***Sri vishnu chitta pada pankaja sangamaaya cheto mama spruhayate kim   
atah parena |*** ***No chet mamaapi yatishekhara bhaarateenaam bhaavah katham   
bhavitum arhati vaagvidheyah |*** 



Sri Vishnu Puraanam is a very great work. Mere *paaraayanam * of this work itself bestows all good. It propounds the loftiest of thoughts, and established the nature of all the realities, *tattva, hita, purushaartha*, as established in the *Vedaas*. This is one *Puraana*, which is referred to by all commentators, and is well known as *Puraana Ratnam*, as told by Sri Aalavandaar, who in his *Stotra Ratnam*, offers *pranaamams * to *Paraasharar * who has graced us this *Puraana Ratnam*. 



*Vedeshu pourusham sooktam puraaneshu cha vaishnavam |* *Bhaarate bhagavad geethaa dharma shaastreshu maanavam ||* 



 [[2]] This *Vishnu Puraana * is very well known and accepted. This is said to be *Puraana Ratna*, like *Stotra Ratna * and *Mantra Ratna*. The ten qualities of a *ratna*, a gem are all to be found in this *Puraana*, says Swami Deshikan in his *Stotra Ratna Bhaashya*. It is 1. *Atraasam*, faultless. *Traasa * is a defect found in gemstones, and stones which do not have it are *atraasa*. The *Vishnu Puraana * is like that. 2. *Maanadam*, brings respectability to those who study it, 3. *Sthiram Ratnam*, very stable, lasts for a long time, 4. *Bhogyam*, most enjoyable, because it is all about the *svaroopa, roopa, **vibhava*, of *Paramaatman*, 5. *Prakaashakam*, causes delightful experiences to one who studies, 6. *Mahaargham*, highly valuable, priceless, 7. *Mangalam*, considered most auspicious, 8. *Maanyam*, deserves to be handled with great respect, 9. *Suraksham*, worthy of being protected, with great care, 10. *Sugraham*, can be handled easily also. All these are qualities of a *ratna*, found in Vishnu Puraana, and so is rightly told as *Puraana Ratna * by Sri Aalavandaar. 



Among all the *vidyaa sthaanaas * that one has to study, fourteen in number, *Angaani vedaah chatvaaro meemaamsaa nyaaya vistarah |* *Puraanam dharma shaastram cha vidyaah hi etaah chaturdashaah ||* *Puraana * is one of the fourteen, essentially to be studied by all. One has to understand the meanings of the *shrutis * only with the help of *itihaasaas, **puraanaas*, etc. which are called *upabrahmanaas. Upabrahmana * is that which details the meanings of the *shrutis*, because the *shrutis * are most difficult to understand. *Upabrahmanaas * are written by great sages.  [[3]] 



There is a famous statement: *Itihaasa puraanaabhyaam vedam samupabrahmayet | * *Bibheti alpashrutaat vedo maamayam pratarediti ||* *Veda * is scared of those who study the *shrutis * without the help of *upabrahmanaas * like Srimad Raamaayana, Srimad Bhaagavatha, Sri Vishnu Puraana, etc. One has to take the help of these *upabrahmanaas * to understand the teachings of the Vedaas. Bhaashyakaarar says in Sri Bhaashya, quoting this *shloka*, that ' *Iti shaastrena arthasya itihaasa **puraanaanaam upabrahmanam kaaryam*', one has to take the help of these *upabrahmanaas*. Bhaashyakaarar gives a wonderful definition of *upabrahmana, 'Upabrahmanam naama vidita sakala veda sadarthaanaam **prayoga mahima saakshaatkruta veda tattvaarthaanaam vaakyaih **svaavagata veda vaakyaartha vyakteekaranam*', meaning that those who have understood all the meanings of the Vedaas, and the purport of the Vedaas, extolling the greatness of *Paramaatman*, establishing the *svaroopa*, *roopa, vibhava * of *Paramaatman*, having realized those meanings, having perceived directly the realities, putting in words very clearly and vividly the meanings of the Veda Vaakyaas. This is the importance of *Upabrahmana*. Here, the meaning of Veda is said to be Vedaanta, because dharma *shaastraas * do *upabrahmana * of the *poorva **bhaaga \(karma kaanda\)* of the Vedaas; whereas *itihaasaas * and *puraanaas * do *upabrahmana * of the latter part \( *jnyaana kaanda * or *brahma kaanda*\) of the Vedaas. In *dharma **shaastraas* also, *brahma pratipaadana * is found; the purpose is establishing the fact that *karmaas * are all *aaraadhana roopa * of *Bhagavaan*. Whereas in the *uttara kaanda*, they are established very clearly. In *itihaasaas * and *puraanaas * also, we see *karma pratipaadana*, which is meant for establishing the *karma * as accessories to *brahma upaasana*. The main purpose of *itihaasa * and *puraana * are for *vishadeekarana * of the meanings of *Vedaanta*. *Dharma shaastraas * are meant mainly to explain the meanings of the *poorva bhaaga*. This is as explained by Sri Sudarshana Suri. 



 [[4]] These works given to us by the Rishis and Aachaaryaas are most valid. They are the ultimate *pramaana * for us. Aapastambhar says *Dharmajnya samayah **pramaanam*, and *Vedaascha*. First he gave importance to the works of those who have understood the meanings of the Vedaas - what they practice and do *anusthaana*. Gautama Rishi says *Vedo akhilo dharma moolam tadvidaam **cha smruti sheele*. 



It is necessary to understand the greatness of this work Sri Vishnu Puraana, and the *praamaanya*, validity of this work, which is established in great detail by Sri Sudarshana Suri in the celebrated work Shrutaprakaashikaa. He explains why Vishnu Puraana is *parama pramaana. Prasiddhi atishaya labdha **sajaateeya prabandha prakarshatvaat*. Sri Vishnu Puraana is *sattva moola*, a *saatvika puraana. Saatvika puraanaas * are those which are in line with *shrutis*. Though the number of *puraanaas * where *Shiva paaramya * is seen are more, they are all said to be *raajasa * and *taamasa puraanaas*. Even though there are thousands of statements made out of *bhraanti*, one *vaakya * which is established without *bhraanti * would be more valid, says Shrutaprakaashikaachaarya. He gives many quotations, *Agneh shivasya **maahaatmyam taamaseshu prakeertyate | Raajaseshu cha maahaatmyam **adhikam brahmano viduh | Saatvikeshu atha kalpeshu maahaatmyam **adhikam hareh | Teshu eva yoga samsiddhaah samishyanti paraam gatim |* 



By this, it is known that Vishnu Puraana is *samyak jnyaana nishpaadaka **sattva moola. Anyathaa jnyaana vipareetajnyaana hetu bhoota tamo **moolatva abhaavaat |* This *puraana * establishes the realities without any doubt, and there is no defect of the form of *anyathaa jnyaana*, thinking of the *dharmaas * of one as different, like thinking that *deha * is *nitya. Vipareeta **jnyaana * is *sarvaarthaan vipareetaan cha buddhih saa paartha taamasi*, perceiving differently the *dharmi * itself, thinking that *deha * itself is *aatman*. None of these are found in Vishnu Puraana's *upadeshaas*. This is one reason why it is more valid, *pramaana * for us. 



 [[5]] In Moksha Dharma it is said that through *Bhagavat kataaksha, sattva guna **moola samyak jnyaana nischaya * is told. This also establishes that Vishnu *Puraana * is *saatvika puraana*. There is no *kaarana dosha * for this *puraana*. 



The next aspect is *prasiddhi*; this is a very well known *puraana. **Shankaraachaarya * quotes hundreds of *shlokaas * from Vishnu Puraana in the Bhaashyaas. He says ' *Tat uktam puraane*' without qualifying the word *puraana * as Sri Vishnu Puraana. This shows the *prasiddhi * of Sri Vishnu *Puraana*. 



Another aspect told by Sri Sudarshana Suri is that there is no *baadhaka **pratyaya * like other *puraanaas*. Everywhere in this *puraana, Sriman **Naaraayana * is only established as the sole cause of creation, etc. The very first question asked by Maitreya Rishi was a very generic question - from whom did this universe arise, and questions like that. The reply was very specific pointing out Vishnu as the cause. This is different from other *puraanaas * like *Lainga puraana*, where the question at the beginning uses the word *linga*; when the question is like that, the answer is also like that, and there is no *atishaya * in this. But when the question is generic and the reply is pointing specifically that Vishnu is cause. This shows the *atishaya * of the *puraana*. It is well known in the *shrutis * that *Sriman **Naaraayana * is the sole cause, in general and specific terms also. They clearly declare that others are not the cause. By this, we can know that other *puraanaas * which are declaring the *kaaranatva * of Brahma or Rudra, are opposed to the *shrutis*. Sri Sudarshana Suri notes that even in *Lainga **Puraana, Naaraayana kaaranatva* is declared clearly. We also see this in *Manu * and other *dharma shaastraas*. This establishes the *praamaanya * of Vishnu Puraana. 



Sri Sudarshana Suri says *Vaktru vailakshanya*, as *Paraashara Muni * is telling this; *paraan aashrunaati iti paraasharah*, one who torments the disputants  [[6]] with unassailable logic. *Shruti * declares the greatness of *Paraashara*. This is also told in *Lainga Puraana*. 



One more is *Pulastya Vasishta varadaana labdha vara devataa **paaramaarthya jnyaanavattvam*. This is going to come in Sri Vishnu Puraana itself. Paraashara Muni tells about this *vruttaanta*, when Maitreya reminds him of that. In Lainga Puraana also, it is extolled that Paraashara had *devataa paaramaarthya jnyaana*. This is another greatness of this Puraana. 



Sri Vishnu Puraana has all the *Vedaarthaas*. It is told that Vishnu Puraana is *sarva vedaartha samyutam*. This is why it bestows the knowledge to attain all the *Purushaarthaas. Prabandha vailakshanya * and *vakrtu vailakshanya * are clearly established. And Vishnu's paaramya is told in other *puraanaas*. 



With respect to these *puraanaas*, some parts may be lost. There may be some objections that the last part may have something else. Since this is a well known *puraana * quoted by many, and told everywhere, there cannot be some parts lost in this *puraana*. And it is not like Mahaabhaarata where a hundred thousand *shlokaas * are there. This has got six thousand *shlokaas*. This is *anati vistrutatayaa*, there is no *prakshepa shankaa*. 



Sri Sudarshana Suri quotes a *praakruta shloka*, which establishes the *prasiddhi * about one person who had gone astray, and with another woman, and that person says that 'Now I have heard Vishnu Puraana, and will not do anything wrong, will do all *praayischittaas * and go back to my wife'. He teaches the other woman to also do the same. This shows the *prasiddhi * of this *puraana*, how it can transform people. 



 [[7]] To establish *Vishnu paaramya*, this is not the purpose with which this *puraana * was told. Because the question is a very generic question, but the answer is very specific. This also establishes the authenticity of this work. 



Like other *puraanaas * there are no self contradicting statements in this *puraana*. This is completely dedicated the greatness of *Bhagavaan **Vishnu*. Sri Sudarshana Suri establishes the validity of this *puraana * in great detail. He establishes that this is the most authentic work which we can accept for understanding the meanings of the Vedaas. 



A *puraana * generally has *Sargascha pratisargascha vamsho manvantaraani cha |* *Vamshaanucharitam cha iti puraanam pancha lakshanam ||* There are five aspects - *sarga *\(about *srushti*\), *pratisarga *\(about *pralaya*\), the various *vamshaas*, the *manvantaraas*, the *vamsha anucharitaas*. 



Srimad Raamaayana is telling a story. Is the story more important there? It is not, because it is told in the beginning as *veda upabrahmanaarthataaya*, that Valmiki taught Lava and Kusha who were well versed in the Vedaas, he chose them to spread this Raamaayana. It is well known that that is the purpose. 



The author of this Puraana is Sri Paraasharar, who taught this to Maitreya. Swami Deshikan says that this *puraana * is like a Gangaa river, we get immersed in that so that we get purified. Sages like Paraashara are doing their effort like Bhageeratha, he did not give up till his *poorvajaas * attained *punya loka*. 



 [[8]] The teachings of this *puraana * is told by Sri Aalavandaar. *Tattvena yah chit achit eeshvara sat svabhaava bhogaapavarga tat upaaya **gateeh udaarah |* *Sandarshayan niramimeeta puraana ratnam tasmai namo munivaraaya **paraasharaaya ||* The first half of this *shloka * summarizes the contents of this *puraana*. Sri Paraashara is most benevolent, most compassionate. There are three realities in our *siddhaanta, chit, achit * and *eeshvara. Chit * is all the *jeevaatmans, achit * is all the inert matter, and *Eeshvara * is the supreme Lord. Their *svabhaavaas*, along with *bhoga *\(all *iha, aamushmika **sukhaas*\), *apavarga *\( *moksha upaaya*\), the means to attain them are also told here. The *purushaartha * which one attains are told here, various *gatis*, including the various *narakaas*. This is all the teachings of this *puraana*, is the conclusion of Aalavandaar. 



This *puraana * has got one commentary by Sri Engal Aalwaan. Sri Engal Aalwaan was *aachaarya * of Nadadur Ammaal. Sri Sudarshana Suri is well known author of Shrutaprakaashikaa, which is *prakaashana * of what he heard through *kaalakshepaas*, taught by Nadadur Ammaal. It is the teachings of Sri Nadadur Ammaal, on the Sri Bhaashya. Sri Nadadur Ammaal went to Tiruvallarai kshetra where Sri Engal Aalwaan was there. Sri Engal Aalwaan has written a wonderful commentary and this has been published by Prativaadi Bhayankaram Annangaaraachaarya Swami; there is also a very old book not easily available. This is called Vishnu Chittiya. This is in Sanskrit. 



Sri Vishnu Puraana has 6000 *shlokaas*, in six *amshaas*. Sri Engal Aalwaan gives *mangala shlokaas * in the beginning. He offers his *pranaamams * to *Purushottama*, from whom everything is created, in whom everything exists, and in whom everything goes and merges. This is what is told in the Brahma Sutra, Janmaadyasya yatah. He is *antaryaami*, Purushottama, I offer my *pranaamams*. I offer my *pranaamans * to Paraashara Muni who has given us this Vishnu Puraana.  [[9]] 



***Yasmaat idam jagat ajaayata yatra tishati ante samastam idam astam   
upaiti yatra |*** ***Tasmai namah sat asat aadi vikalpa shoonyah chaitanyamaatra   
vapushe purushottamaaya ||*** 



Veda has got six *angaas*; one has to study the *angaas * to understand the *Vedaas - Shikshaa, Vyaakaranam, Chandas, Niruktam, Jyoutisham, **Kalpa. * Just like this, Vishnu Puraana is like Vedaa itself, having six *amshaas*. All the *Vedaarthaas * can be found here in these six *amshaas*. 



For Namaalwaar's Tiruvoimoli, there is a *vyaakhyaana * by Thirukurai Pillan Piraan called *Aaraaryirappadi*. It is said that he wrote this like Vishnu Puraana, with 6000 *padis*. 



We shall take up study of the *shlokaas * and also the *vyaakhyaana*. In the beginning Sri Engal Aalwaan gives an introduction.
