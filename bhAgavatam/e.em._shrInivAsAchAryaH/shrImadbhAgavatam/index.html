<p>[TABLE]</p>
<p><strong>FOREWORD</strong></p>
<p><strong>______</strong></p>
<p><strong>T</strong> has been the ambition of Mr. G. A. Natesan to popularise the three most important poems in the sacred literature of India by bringing out abridgments of the original Sanskrit texts with an English translation. He first brought out an abridgment of Valmiki&rsquo;s Ramayana, the most famous Kavya in the classical literature of India. This was immediately followed by the abridgment of the Mahabharata, the greatest Itihasa. His latest venture is the abridgment of the Srimad Bhagavata which may be justly described as the greatest and most popular of the Puranas. Every Purana has necessarily to deal with a certain number of topics according to traditional conventions, and the manner of treatment of these topics is more or less on similar lines. But each Purana is further intended to serve a special purpose. The Puranas generally contain a strange medley of fables and fairy tales, philosophy and religion, myth and legend. It is not easy for a Western reader to appreciate to appreciate the teaching and value of our Puranas without a knowledge of the methods employed by the ancient</p>
<p>Indian sages for inculcating the principles of ethics or the tenets of religion. The Bhagavata shares the defects of Puranas generally. It is full of incredible stories and miracles, and embodies divergent philosophical doctrines, divers cults, stories intended to exalt some particular incarnation or manifestation of the Deity and stories which do not hesitate to attribute faults of character to God or which may appear to the reader to have an immoral tendency. It is not free from the bias of sectarianism. Its literary merit is not uniform and is so uneven in substance and in style that we may reasonably suspect many interpolations and the work of more hands than one. The style is often harsh and rugged, involving highly artificial combinations of words. It has got its peculiar terminology. In this respect it compares unfavourably with the Ramayana. In spite of these defects, the Bhagavata has acquired a wonderful hold upon the minds of Hindus. It has a fascination even for the minds of those who. like myself, are keenly alive to its defects.</p>
<p>What is the secret of the appeal that the Bhagavata makes even to the mind of the educated Hindu? The main theme of the Bhagavata is the importance of Haribhakti or devotion to God, especially in His manifestation as Krishna. It is generally said that the Bhagavata is par excellence the Purana which emphasises the value of Bhakti</p>
<p>(devotion) and Virakti (detachment). Attractive stories are a vehicle employed by the Hindu sages for teaching morality and religion. The author of the Bhagavata has largely availed himself of this method.</p>
<p>The sage Vyasa who had edited the Vedas and composed composed the Mahabharata did not attain serenity or happiness in spite of the completion of his labours and his immersion in philosophy and religion. If there was any philosopher who could have appreciated the truth of the Vedanta philosophy and enjoyed intimacy with the formless Absolute (Nirguna Brahman), it was Vyasa. He Was told by Narada that he could attain peace of mind and happiness only by dwelling upon the incarnations of Lord Vasudeva and singing his glory.</p>
<p>The stories of the Deity and His miraculous intervention to help His votaries often read like fairy tales. They are not, however, accepted by the thoughful at their face value. It is pointed out by Sri Sankaracharya that the object of myth and legend in the Vedas is merely to lure the mind to the truths of religion. The stories are treated AS mere Arthavada (eulogistic) and not as facts. If, notwithstanding the progress of knowledge. educated people still listen with delight to these stories, it is because even they have not outgrown the credulity of childhood. What appeals</p>
<p>to the childhood of the human race appeals even to grown-up individuals in civilised societies. Bernard Shaw has remarked that there is evidence for a law of conservation of credulity. Our appetite for the marvellous still persists in the hiddenrecesses of the mind. Stories of miracles are to be found in the Bible and in the literature of most religions. It is these defects which first strike the superficial observer who is unable to separate the pearls of truth and wisdom from the shells in which they are imbedded. Macaulay made fun of the history and geography of the Hindus, history abounding with kings thirty feet high and reigns thirty thousand years long, and geography made up of seas of treacle and seas of butter&quot;. But no educated Hindu takes these descriptions for history or geography.</p>
<p>Dismissing these stories as intended for the entertainment of undeveloped minds, we find in the Bhagavata the highest truths of religion and philosophy and the highest principles of ethics expounded in appropriate language. The lilt of the verse in the Bhagavata has apeculiar charm of its own; it varieswith the occasion as it is gay or grave, from the lighter and swift moving measure of the madrigal and the pastoral song to the slow and solemn measureof the hymn. There</p>
<p>is a solemnity and grandeur in the devotional songs which attunes the mind to the high theme. It is a poem to suit different modes and emotions, the mood of adoration or worship, of sorrow or joy, of peace and tranquillity, of discontent with the things of the world and a desire for freedom from its trammels, of humility and regret over wasted opportunities for salvation, of perplexity about the mysteries of the universe and the ways of God or of passionate yearning for union with God. with God. While the Western mind prefers to contemplate God in the role of a law-giver, a judge or a friend, the Hindu mind prefers to dwell upon the conception of God in His incarnation as a child, a son, a lover, a hero, a guide and counsellor, a protector of the oppressed and the humble and the pure in heart. and a saviour. This is the secret of the special charm of the Krishna Avatara.</p>
<p>The virtues ascribed by the author to the Deity may sometimes appear to be carried to extremes. Like the God of the Israelites, the God of the Hindus is described as partial to the Devas or Suras who are His chosen people. This favouritism is unaccountable in view of the fact that the Gods or Suras are, like the Gods of Greek antiquity, not patterns of morality, and the Asuras or Titans are very often superior to the Gods in courage, chivalry,</p>
<p>character and religious devotion. The moral superiority of the Asuras is conspicuous in the case of Vritra, Prahlada and Bali, whose character stands out in shining contrast to that of Indra, the ruler of the Devas. One plausible explanation which occurs to me is that God has been often depicted in the Puranas as a tribal God, and the partiality shown towards the Devas is consistent with this character. The unwilling testimony borne by the Puranas to the character of some of the Asuras is strange and calls for an explanation. The Asuras and Suras were agnatic relations, and the Asuras, who were the Gods of the ancient Iranians, represented the heroes of the Iranian branch of the Indo-Aryan family from which the Aryans of India separated when they trekked towards India.</p>
<p>The protection of servants, dependants and votaries is an obligation and a virtue. Krishna exhibits a most touching solicitude for the inviolability of the troth of his Bhaktas even at the sacrifice sometimes of his own. One circumstance which must never be lost sight of sight of in our appraisal of the characters and events depicted in the Puranas or, for the matter of that, any work of past history, is that they reflect the conditions of the society in which the authors lived and</p>
<p>the beliefs and ethical standards current at the time.</p>
<p>The scale of ethical and religious values is no doubt liable to change in in course of time, but the development of morality and religion had attained such a height in ancient India that it is doubtful whether humanity has made any great progress in these spheres.</p>
<p>It is often popularly supposed that idolatry is favoured or enjoined by the Hindu religion. While Hinduism permits the worship of idols, it is only a concession to the ignorant who are incapable of rising to abstract conceptions and the higher forms of religious belief. It is recognised and allowed only as the lowest rung of the devotional ladder. But when the mind is educated and becomes capable of concentration, abstraction and meditation, the worshipper is gradually led on to the highest truths of religion. The Bhagavata recognises the principle of relativity and its spiritual prescriptions are adjusted to the different stages of individual development.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the tendency of our moralists and religious teachers to emphasise the value of the particular truths which they wish to impress on the mind by recourse to exaggeration. The importance of obedience to the father is illustrated by the story of Parasurama who killed</p>
<p>even his mother at thebidding of his father. The banishmentof Sita to the forest is intended to illustrate the obligation of the sovereign to sacrifice his own personal happiness for the purpose of avoiding even the slightest breath of scandal against the throne. The value of the invocation of the Deity and the repetition of His name as a means of leading the mind to the thought of God and concentration upon the idea of God is illustrated by the extravagant story of Ajamila who was saved after a life of libertinism by pronouncing the name of Narayana. The human wish for longevity which often expresses itself in the longing for eternity is illustrated in the story of an ancient king Bharata who is said to have lived for ten million years. The slaughter of Kshatriyas by Parasurama must be interpreted not as a wanton act of revenge, but as an attempt to crush the growing militarism and aggressiveness of the warrior caste.</p>
<p>The amours of Krishna have often proved a stumbling-block to the faithful and have furnished a handle to the critics of Hinduism. Several explanations have been attempted and the author of the Bhagavata himself raises the question and suggests an explanation that super-menare not to be judged by the standards of ordinary humanity. Many interesting</p>
<p>questions are raised by this riddle. Are the incidents historical facts or were they merely the outcome of the luxuriance of the poet&rsquo;s voluptuous imagination? One circumstance which may throw light in forming an opinion upon this question is that Krishna has always been depicted in the Bhagavata as an incarnation in which he asserted and manifested his omnipotence and other divine attributes from time to time. He oftendeclared himself to be divine and was believed by his kinsmen and followers to be divine. When the sage Narada wished to find out how Krishna could lead could lead a happy married lifewith his 16,000 wives, he visited their mansions and found Krishna in every one of their homes. We must interpret the story and judge of the characters with due regard to the setting of the story and its milieu. Even the Gopis who ardently loved him addressed him as being not the son of a Gopi, but as the divinity residing in the hearts of all persons, who had taken a human form for the protection of the world. They idolised him as the Paramatman in the flesh.</p>
<p>Hinduism often depicts God as the creator, preserver and destroyerof the universe. He is often identified with relentless time or fate. He is represented in the Bhagavata as having become incarnate as Krishna to reduce</p>
<p>the over—population of the world. War was one of the well—known means by which the evil of over—population was rectifiedBhagavata describes Krishna as assuming in the world. When the authorof the responsibility for the drunken brawls and mutual slaughter of the turbulent Yadavas, he is simply identified with the evolutionary process of the world. The story is also intended to emphasise the evils of addiction to liquor.</p>
<p>The value ofthe Bhagavata to the devout consists not so much in the stories and legends with which it abounds or in the charming lyrics or in the beauty of its poetic descriptions or in the portrayal of human nature with its intense human interest, but in its exposition of the main theme of the book. The essential truths which it emphasises again and again are the imperishability of the soul, the goodness, power and helpfulness of God and the attainment of salvation by the method of Bhakti. The path of Bhakti or devotion has sometimes been misrepresented by hostile critics. The true spirit of religion implies the adoration and love of God and the desire for unionwith God. The highest conception of bliss is not, according to the Hindu mind, mere prostration and service at the foot of the Almighty, but a loving union with Him. The salvation may take the shape of Salokya,</p>
<p>Sarupya or Sayujya. In emphasising Bhakti as a method of salvation, the Bhagavata does not fail to lay stress on theneed for the service and love of humanity, nay of all living beings. There are beings. There are innumerable passages dwelling upon the importance of identifying oneself with all humanity. It is sufficient to quote one of the many passages in which goodness is defined:</p>
<p><strong>कृपालुरकृतद्रोहः तितिक्षुः सर्वदेहिनाम्।<br>
सत्यसारोऽनवद्यात्मा समः सर्वोपकारकः॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>कामैरहतधीदान्तां मृदुः शुचिरकिञ्चनः।<br>
अमानो मानदः कल्पः मैत्रः कारुणिकः कविः॥<br>
धर्मान् संत्यज्य यः सर्वान् मां भजेत स सत्तमः॥</strong></p>
<p>No other work in the Hindu religious literature has made a more careful study of the psychology of Bhakti. The man who truly loves God cannot possibly go astray.</p>
<p>Mr. Natesan&rsquo;s object in publishing this abridgment of the Bhagavata is laudable. In making the selections from such a voluminous work, he has followed a principle of his own. His purpose is evidently to give some idea of all the Avataras described in the Bhagavata. To keep his book within the limits of space he has prescribed for himself he has cut out many passages of</p>
<p>great beauty, especially the hymns. Opinions may differ as to the portions of the original which should have been included or excluded. But this is to a great extent amatter for individual judgment and taste. I understand that it is his intention to follow upthis book with an anthology of hymns in which I hope several of the hymns of the Bhagavata will find a place. Mr. Natesan has been fortunate in securing the services of Pandit A. M. Srinivasachari for the task of condensation and of Dr. V. Raghavan, a competentSanskrit scholar, for the translationofthe original text.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S NOTE</strong></p>
<p><strong>______</strong></p>
<p>THE Srimad Bhagavata was composed by Sage Vyasa at the instance of Sage Narada. This Purana, singing exclusively of the Lord&rsquo;sglories and of the greatness of Devotion to Him, Vyasa taught to his son, Suka. Suka recited the Bhagavata to King Parikshit, the grandson of the Pandavas, who had been cursed to death. Subsequently the Suta, or minstrel, named Ugrasravas, of Romaharshana, recited this Bhagavata, as done by Vyasa to Suka and Suka to Parikshit, to Saunaka and other Brahmins and the sages assembled in the Naimisa forest during the session of the Sacrifice performed by Saunaka. The text proper, as narrated by Suka to Parikshit, is not given directly as Suka&rsquo;s narration. Almost every section is a narrative by some different person and this has made the structure of the Purana very involved. The text presented in this condensation is given as if it were all recited directly by Suka himself. The names of different persons to whom the different narratives are addressedare enclosed in square brackets as well as the addresses, by name by name or attribute, to King</p>
<p>Parikshit, made by Suka. These are left untranslated. In all these respects, the plan of the earlier publication, the Mahabharata, is followed.</p>
<p>As in the case of the Bharata, an index to the proper names occurring in the condensed text has been added. The reader is requested to refer to the index at the end of the Mahabharata also, since there are names common to these two works.</p>
<p>In preparing this English Translation, I have been, as before, helped by Professors K. A. Nilakanta Sastri and K. Swaminathan, and Mr. K. Balasubrahmania Ayyar, to whom Itake this opportunity to render thanks.</p>

<p><strong>PUBLISHER&rsquo;S NOTE</strong></p>
<p><strong>_____</strong></p>
<p>FEW books in Sanskrit sacred literature appeal so much to the hearts of millions of Indians as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata. I feel most thankful that it has been given to me to present to thePublic in rapid succession these precious compilations of the great triad wherein lie embedded all that is noble and inspiring in Hindu religion, philosophy and culture. Carefully compiled and translated into simple, readable English, these books will, in the words of a great Orientalist, “ form a source of joy to the thorough knower of the epics as well as to the person who reads them for the first time, to the orthodox as much as to the modern, for youth as well as for riper age, for the Western reader as much As for the Eastern&quot;</p>
<p>It only remains for me to express my profound gratitude to Sir Sivaswamy Aiyer—the finest embodiment of Eastern and Western culture—for his great kindness in writing the Foreword to this work.</p>

<p>In the divine region of (the forest of) Naimisa, Saunaka and other sages eagerly enquired this of Suta<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, the minstrel, who was seated there (duly) honoured.</p>

<p>&quot; By you, O sinless soul, the Puranas with the legends of yore as well as the Institutes of Dharma have been studied and recited. In those various texts, O long-lived Suta, what has been determined by you, in straight interpretation, as the invariable good for men, that you must tell us.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यस्यावतारो भूतानां क्षेमाय च भवाय च।<br>

<p>Rejoicing at this excellent inquiry, the Suta began to speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sages! well have I been asked by you that which is for the well-being of the world; for, of Krishna has this great enquiry been made, an enquiry by which the soul gets completely composed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that is the greatest Dharma for men, by which there shall be devotion for Hari. Therefore, single—minded, one must listen to (the story of) Lord Hari, sing of Him, contemplate and worship Him always.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is Hari who is the import of the Vedas; it is Hari for whom all rituals are intended; it is Hari who is the object of all Dharmas; it is Hari who is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is that great Lord, who, by his own mystic power, created this universe at the beginning.</p>

<p>That Vyasa whose vision was never barren sat all alone and contemplated what was beneficial.</p>

<p>&quot; Under the name of Bharata, I have also laid bare the meaning of the Vedas.</p>

<p>To the hermitage of that Vyasa, who was thus pondering over the waste his soul had been, Narada came, lute in hand, and spoke, smiling a little :</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;कृतवान् भारतं यस्त्वं सर्वार्थपरिबृंहितम्।<br>

<p>&quot; You have composedthe Bharata, enriched with every idea. That eternal thing, the Brahman, you have desired to comprehend and you have comprehended. And still, my Lord, you sorrow for your-Self as if you have not achieved your purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vyasa :</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do have all this you have said; still, my soul is not satisfied; its imperceptible cause that is too deep for me for me to understand, I ask of you. the son of theself—born Brahman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>नारदः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;भवताऽनुदितप्रायं यशो भगवतोऽमलम्।<br>

<p>Narada :</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pure glory of the Lord has almost not been sung by you. Ithink, that philosophy whereby the Lord would not be satisfied, is a waste .</p>
<p><strong>यथा धर्मादयश्चार्था मुनिवर्यानुकीर्तिताः।<br>

<p>&ldquo;In the manner in which, Obest of sages, Dharma and other ideas have been described by you, the greatness of Vasudeva has not been described.</p>

<p>&quot; That outpour of the Lord&rsquo;s story washes away the sins of all humanity; though there are flaws in it in every verse, there are in it the names of the</p>
<p>imperishable Lord, marked with his fame; and for this reason do good men listen to, sing and proclaim it to others.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;अथो महाभाग भवानमोघदृक्<br>

<p>&ldquo;Hence, you blessed Vyasa of unerring insight, you who are of pure fame, truthful and austere, recapitulate with concentration for the release of all from bondage, the doings of the Lord who pervades the whole universe with His great strides.</p>

यदीश्वरे भगवति कर्म ब्रह्मणि भावितम्॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; This, O Brahmin, has been indicated as the cure for the threefold miseries, namely, the offering of action to the Lord, the Master and Supreme Being.</p>
<p><strong>&rsquo; आमयो यश्च भूतानां जायते येन सुव्रत।<br>

<p>“O Vyasa of excellent vows, that which produces malady to beings does not itself cure if administered as medicine. Thus are all actions of men, cause only of transmigration but, offered to the Supreme, they become capable of destroying themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>एवं संभाष्य भगवान्ययौ यादृच्छिको मुनिः॥</strong></p>
<p>Having spoken thus, the blessed sage, Narada, who had come there accidentally, went away.</p>

<p>Exceptionally righteous, that king, Parikshit, lord and teacher of the world, restored to Dharma its three lost feet, penance, purity and compassion, soothed (the suffering) Earth and made her prosper.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1Parikshit was the son of Abhimanyu and Uttara; Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna, Yudhishthira&rsquo;s younger brother. Parikshit was born a corpse as a result of the deadly missile aimed at his mother&rsquo;s womb by Asvatthaman. Krishna brought him to life by His power. He succeeded the Pandavas on the throne. See The Mahabharata (G. A. Natesan &amp; Co.) pp. 375-383 and 445 seq.</p>

<p>The son of that sage,a man of exceeding spiritual power, heard ( of this )and said this there: &ldquo;Now that Lord Krishna, the chastiser of the erring, is gone, I shall chastise the transgressors; witness my prowess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king is the guardian of Dharma and that that Parikshit is an emperor of great renown, a great devotee of the Lord, a sage among kings and and a performer of horse-sacrifices. Pitiable with fatigue, hunger and thirst, he hardly deserves a curse from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>इति पुत्रकृताघेन सोऽनुतप्तो महामुनिः।<br>
स्वयं विप्रकृतो राज्ञा नैवाधं तदचिन्तयत्॥</strong></p>
<p>Thus did the great sage repent for the sin committed by his son; himself wronged by the king, he did not think at all of that wrong.</p>
<p><strong>महीपतिस्त्वथ तत्कर्म गर्ह्यं<br>
विचिन्तयन्नात्मकृतं सुदुर्मनाः।<br>
स साधु मेने नचिरेण तक्षका—<br>
नलं प्रसक्तस्य विरक्तिकारणम्॥</strong></p>
<p>And the king then brooded over, with a very depressed heart, that despicable act committed by him and considered welcome the fire of (the serpent) Takshaka as a means to dispassion, for him who had much attachment.</p>
<p><strong>अथो विहायेमममुं च लोकं<br>

कृष्णङ्घ्रिसेवामधिमन्यमानः<br>

<p>Then, leaving aside this world as well as the other, both of which he had already judged as things that must be cast away, he regarded service at the feetof Krishna as greater and sat on banks of the celestial river (the Ganges), vowing to fast unto death.</p>
<p><strong>दध्यौ मुकुन्दाङ्घ्रिमनन्यभावो<br>
मुनिव्रतो मुक्तसमस्तसङ्गः॥</strong></p>
<p>He meditated, with with no other thought, on the feet of Lord Hari, taking to a sage&rsquo;s austerities, and leaving all attachments.</p>
<p><strong>तत्रोपजग्मुर्भुवनं पुनानाः<br>
महानुभावा मुनयस्सशिष्याः।<br>
अभ्यर्च्य राजा स्वचिकीर्षितं यत्<br>

<p>There came, along with pupils, great sages who sanctified the world. Honouring them, the king, with his pure mind, announced what he desired to do.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;द्विजोपसृष्टः कुहकस्तक्षको वा<br>

<p>&ldquo;Let the wily Takshaka urged by the Brahmin bite me by all means; sing you lays of the Lord. Let me have devotion to the imperishableLord and communion with His devotees.Whatever birth I take,let me have good—will towards all great men ; obeisance to the Brahmins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There the divine son of Vyasa, Suka, arrived accidentally, wandering as he was all over the world, looking forward to nothing. The royaldevotee of God, Parikshit, approached him, bowed to him and enquired of him in pleasing words:</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;पुरुषस्येह यत् कार्यंम्रियमाणस्य सर्वथा।<br>
श्रोतव्यं भजनीयं वा ब्रूहि यद्वा विपर्ययम्॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dying person should, at any cost, do, listen to or worship, or what he should not, tell me. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>एवमाभाषितः पृष्टः स राज्ञा प्रत्यभाषत॥</strong></p>
<p>Thus addressed and requested by the king, Suka replied.</p>
<p><strong>श्रीशुकः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘वरीयानेष ते प्रश्नः कृतो लोकहितं नृप॥</strong></p>
<p>Suka—</p>
<p>“Most excellent is this enquiry of yours; for, O King, this is for the good of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great King, to those householders who, attached to their families, do not realise the Truth of Self, things that should be listened to, thought of and worshipped exist in thousands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, Oscion of Bharata, he who desires That en realising which fear ceases to exist, must listen to the glories of Lord Hari, the master and the soul of everything, must sing of Him and think of Him.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;जन्मलाभः परः पुंसामन्ते नारायणस्मृतिः॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest fruit of men having taken a body, is the memory of Narayana during their last moments.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this universe, there was the Lord alone, the all—pervasive soul of all beings. There was also the mystic power of this Lord, the spectator, the power known as Maya which is of the form of cause and effect and with which the allpervading Lord created this universe.</p>

<p>This universe was flooded with water at that time (of creation); and lying on those waters, on the bed of the great serpent, the one Being of never-closing eyes, closed His eyes (in mystic sleep), bereft of any yearning and choosing to revel in the bliss of His own self.</p>

<p>Enwombing the subtle essence of all things within His body, He dwelt on those waters which formed His abode. The very subtle principle within Him, desiring to evolve as a result of the active quality, burst forth at that time through his navel.</p>
<p><strong>स पद्मकोशस्सहसोदतिष्ठत्<br>

<p>It suddenly shot up as a lotus-bud. In it was born of himself the creator who is of the form of the Vedas and who is called Svayambhu, the self—born. Entering on concentration, he sat (on the lotus there).</p>

<p>After a time, that creator beheld that one Being who was lying (asleep) shining in his own heart. Desiring heart. Desiring to create, he fastened his mind on that Being in the inscrutable realm and praised that praise-worthy Lord :</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;रूपं यदेतदवतारशतैकबीजं<br>

May you infuse my mind with the knowledge and the power with which you, this Lord, friend and one soul of the universe, make (the universe) happy, so that I shall create and yet avoid the stain attending that act.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>

<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>“What you pray of me, I have already secured for you; your soul shall not be lost in this (act of creation) of yours; for, profuse have been my blessings to you.</p>

<p><strong>‘प्रजास्सृज यथापूर्वंयाश्च मय्यनुशेरते॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>“ (Now,) create, as you did in the previous cycle, the beings that are imbedded in Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>विरिञ्चोऽपि तथा चक्रे यथाऽऽह भगवानजः।<br>
तपसा विद्यया लोकान्प्राग्लीनान् लीलयाऽसृजत्॥</strong></p>
<p>The creator did as the unborn Lord told him. With his penance and knowledge, he sportfully created the worlds that had previously dissolved (into the Lord).</p>
<p><strong>परमेष्ठी त्वपां मध्ये तदा सन्नामवेक्ष्य गाम्।<br>

<p>But seeing the earth lost at that time in the midst of waters, the creator creator thought for a long time of how he could lift her up.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यस्याहं हृदयादासं स ईशो विदधातु मे॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;May that Master from whose heart I had my being do me (what is needful). &quot;</p>

<p>From the nostril of the creator who was thus meditating, there issued out, of a sudden, a little Boar, of the size of the thumb.</p>
<p><strong>तस्याभिपश्यतः स्वस्थः क्षणेन किल [भारत]।<br>

<p>Even as the creator was looking on, that Boar which was standing in the skies. grew as big as an elephant within a moment; looking like a great mountain, it roared.</p>
<p><strong>विनद्य भूयो जलमाविवेश क्रोडापदेशस्स्वयमध्वराङ्गः॥</strong></p>
<p>Roaring again, the Lord Himself who embodied the sacrifice and had taken the guise of the Boar, dived into the waters.</p>

<p>Lifting with His tusk the earth which was submerged, He rose up from the nether world and looked resplendent. There, (in the nether world) the Lord, whose prowess none can withstand, killed the prime demon (Hiranyaksha)¹ who attacked Him with his mace and obstructed Him.</p>
<p><strong>क्ष्मामुत्क्षिपन्तं गजलीलयाऽङ्गविरिञ्चिमुख्या उपतस्थुरीशम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The creator and other (sages and gods) extolled the Master who was lifting up the earth, with the ease of an elephant (lifting a little object).</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>1THE STORY OF HIRANYAKSHA : Once Sanaka and other sons of Brahma went to Vishnu&rsquo;s abode in Vaikuntha to worship Him and they were prevented from entering the sanctum by Jaya and Vijaya, the door-keepers of Vishnu. For this rudeness, Jaya and Vijaya were cursed to be born as demons. They are first born as the primo domon-twins, Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksha, in the womb of Diti. The latter is slain by the Lord in the Varaha avatara and the former in the Narasimha avatara. They are again born as Ravana and Kumbhakarna to be slain in the Rama avatara and once again as Sisupala and Dantavaktra to be slain in the Krishna avatara. These successive encounters with the Lord and death at His handspurify them and they ultimately regain the divinestate which was theirs before their fall.</p>

<p>THE STORY OF THE INCARNATION AS KAPILA</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p><strong>प्रजास्सृजेति भगवान् कर्दमो ब्रह्मणोदितः।<br>
सम्प्रपेदे हरि भक्त्या प्रपन्नवरदाशुषम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Being told by (the Creator) Brahmato procreate human beings, the divine with devotion Kardama* sought with devotion (Lord) Hari who liberally bestows boons on those who seek Him.</p>
<p><strong>तावत्प्रसन्नो भगवान् दर्शयामास तं वपुः॥</strong></p>
<p>Becoming gracious (towards Kardama), the Lord showed him His ferm.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Kardama: The creator Brahma who was born of the navel-lotus of the Lord created the elements, the world of animals and trees and then the sages and divine beings. Among the last were Daksha, Kardama and others who were the progenitors of the human race (Prajapatis).</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘प्रजापतिसुतस्सम्राण्महिष्या शतरूपया।<br>
आयास्यत्यात्मजां दास्यत्यनुरूपाय ते प्रभो॥</strong></p>
<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great sage! the Emperor (Manu)*, the son of the Creator, will go (here) with his queen Satarupa and will give in marriage his daughter (Devahuti) to you who are a<br>
meet husband for her.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;सहाहं स्वांशकलया त्वद्वीर्येण महामुने।<br>
तव क्षेत्रे देवहूत्यां प्रणेष्ये तत्त्वसंहिताम्॥’</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Sage, partially manifesting myself through your energy in thy wife Devahuti, I shall found a system of philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>* Manu is the first man. After creating the sages and divine boings, Brahma felt that he could not yet bring into being the human species and as he was feeling thus, his form divided into two, a male and a female. The male is Manu, the first man and emperor; he is called Svayambhuva Manu, i.e., Manu born of the Creator, Svayambhu. The female was Satarupa who became Manu&rsquo;s queen and from this prime-couple, the human species began to develop. Two sons, Priyavrata and Uttanapada, and three daughters, Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti, were born to Manu and Satarupa. Manu gives Devahuti in marriage to Kardama Prajapati and of those two is born sage Kapila, an incarnation of the Lord to bless the world with spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>अथ संप्रस्थिते शुक्ले कर्दमो भगवानृषिः।<br>
आस्ते स्म बिन्दुसरसि तं कालं प्रातेपालय।<br>
उपायादाश्रमपदमादिराजस्सहात्मजः॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, after the Lord (the pure Being) had disappeared, the divine sage Kardama was staying at (lake) Bindusaras, awaiting the time (of Manu&rsquo;s arrival). (Manu,) the first of Kings, along with his daughter, came to (Kardama&rsquo;s) hermitage.</p>
<p><strong>मनुः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;प्रियव्रतोत्तानपदोस्स्वसेयं दुहिता मम।<br>
अन्विच्छति पतिं युक्तं प्रत्तां प्रतिगृहाण मे॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Manu—</p>
<p>“This daughter of mine, the sister of Priyavrata and Uttanapada, seeks a suitable husband; accept her whom whom I give marriage to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>कर्दमः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>बाढमुद्वोढुकामोऽहमप्रत्ता च तवात्मजा&rsquo;॥</strong></p>
<p>Kardama—</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely I am desirous of marrying and your daughter has not yet been given in marriage to anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>सोऽनुज्ञात्वा व्यवसितं महिष्या दुहितुस्स्फुटम्।<br>
तस्मै गुणगणाढ्याय ददौ तुल्यां प्रहर्षितः॥</strong></p>
<p>After learning clearly the resolve of his queen and of his daughter, Manu with great delight gave in marriage to the sage, who was rich with a multitude of virtues, his daughter who was equal to the sage in her qualities ).</p>
<p><strong>तस्यां बहुतिथे काले भगवान्मधुसूदनः।<br>
कार्दमं तीर्यमापन्नो जज्ञेऽग्निरिव दारुणि॥</strong></p>
<p>After a long time, Lord Hari entered the energy of Kardama and was born of Devahuti, like fire of wood.</p>
<p><strong>स चावतीर्णं त्रियुगमाज्ञाय समभाषत॥</strong></p>
<p>And Kardama, understanding his son as God incarnate, spoke.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;स्वच्छन्दशक्तिं कपिलं प्रपद्ये<br>

<p>&ldquo;I take refuge in Kapila whose power is dependent on Himself alone. I now take leave of you (Kapila), the Lord of all beings. Taking to the path of the Sannyasin, I shall move about, fixing you in my heart and bereft of all sorrow.”</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&rsquo; एष आत्मपथोऽव्यक्तो नष्टः कालेन भूयसा।<br>
तं प्रवर्तयितुं देहमिमं विद्धि मया धृतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&ldquo;This secret path for realising the self has been lost for a long time. Know that this body has been taken by me to restore it.</p>
<p><strong>गच्छ कामं मया पृष्टो मयि सन्न्यस्तकर्मणा।<br>
जित्वा सुदुर्जयं मृत्युममृतत्वाय मां भज॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Go as you please; you are permitted by me; with your action offered up to Me, conquer the very invincible Death and seek Me for Immortality.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;मात्रे आध्यात्मिकीं विद्यां शमनीं सर्वकर्मणाम्।<br>
वितरिष्ये यया चासौ भयं चातितरिष्यति॥</strong></p>
<p>“I shall impart to my mother(also) the spiritual knowledge that puts an end to all action, whereby she too shall overcome Fear. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>एवं समुदितस्तेन वनमेव जगाम ह॥</strong></p>
<p>So told by Kapila, Kardama went away to the forests.</p>
<p><strong>पितरि प्रस्थितेऽरण्यं मातुः प्रियचिकीर्षया।<br>
तस्मिन्बिन्दुसरेऽवात्सीद्भगवान्कपिलः किल॥</strong></p>
<p>On the retirement of His father to the forests, Lord Kapila, desiring to do what was dear to His mother, took His mother, took his abode near the lake Bindusara.</p>
<p><strong>स्वसुतं देवहूत्याह &lsquo;प्रपन्नाऽन्धं तमः प्रभो।<br>

लोकस्य तमसाऽन्धस्य चक्षुस्सूर्य इवादितः।<br>
अथ मे देव संमोहमपाक्रष्टुं त्वमर्हसि॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Devahuti told her son: &ldquo;Lord, I am in the utter darkness (of nescience). You are that prime Being, the Lord and Master</p>
<p>of all men, risen like the sun who is the eye of this world, which is blinded with darkness. Therefore, O God! you must remove my gross ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;योग आध्यात्मिकः पुंसां मतो निःश्रेयसाय मे।<br>
तमिमं ते प्रवक्ष्यामि योगं सर्वाङ्गनैपुणम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>“The Yoga of self-knowledge is considered by me as the means of attaining the eternal weal; and that yoga which is efficiency itself in every respect, I shall expound to you.</p>
<p><strong>&rsquo; चेतः खल्वस्य बन्धाय मुक्तये चात्मनो मतम्।<br>
गुणेषु सक्तं बन्धाय रतं वा पुंसि मुक्तये॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The mind it is that is held as the cause of the soul&rsquo;s bondage as well as of its release; engrossed in material objects of enjoyment, it makes for bondage; if it revels in the spirit, it makes for emancipation.</p>
<p><strong>&rsquo; प्रसङ्गमजरं पाशमात्मनः कवयो विदुः।<br>
स एव साधुषु कृतो मोक्षद्वारमपावृतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Attachment to evil, men of vision consider as the never—slackening bondage of the soul; the same attachment, if it is with the good souls, becomes the open entrance to deliverance.</p>
<p><strong>तितिक्षवः कारुणिकाः सुहृदस्सर्वदेहिनाम्।<br>
अजातशत्रवः शान्तास्साधवः साधुभूषणाः॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men are they who are forbearing and and compassionate, who are friends to all beings and for whom there has never been any foe, who are mild and<br>
for whom their character is the ornament.</p>
<p><strong>‘ नैकात्मतां मे स्पृहयन्ति केचिन्<br>

<p>“Some desire not oneness with Me, delighting as they do in service at My feet and yearning for Me,— those for whom I am the object of love, the soul, son, companion, teacher, friends and the deity beloved.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;एतावानेव लोकेऽस्मिन् पुंसां निःश्रेयसोदयः।<br>
तीव्रेण भक्तियोगेन मनो मय्यर्पितं स्थिरम्॥</strong></p>
<p>“Only this much is the fulfilment of everlasting welfare in this world for men, namely, the firm offering of the mind to Me with intense devotion.</p>

<p>eating pure food in moderation, frequently resorting to the security of solitude, non-injury, truthfulness, non-stealing, taking no more than the necessary amount of material possession, restraint in sexual enjoyment, penance, personal purity, study of scriptures, worship of God,— by these and other ways mind casts off its impurity.</p>

<p>Priyavrata and Uttanapada, the sons of Manu, the husband of Satarupa, imbued with an element of God Vasudeva, were engaged in protecting the world.</p>
<p><strong>जाये उत्तानपादस्य सुनीतिस्सुरुचिस्तयोः।<br>

<p>** **There were two wives to Uttanapada, Suniti and Suruchi; of the two, Suruchi was the beloved of her lord, and not the other, whose son was Dhruva.</p>

<p>Once, taking Uttama, the son of Suruchi, on his lap and fondling him, the king did not like Dhruva who also desired to get on his lap.</p>
<p><strong>तथा चिकीर्षमाणं तं सपत्न्यास्तनयं ध्रुवम्।<br>

<p>As the king was listening, the exceedingly haughty Suruchi told Dhruva, her co-wife&rsquo;s son, who was desiring to get upon the lap of his father:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child, you do not deserve to get upon the king&rsquo;s throne; for, though the son of the king, you were not born of my womb. If you desire to be seated with the king contrive to be born of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pierced by these very sharp words of his step-mother, Dhruva approached his own mother, weeping bitterly. Youthful Suniti took her boy on her lap, heard of what had taken place and told him:</p>
<p><strong>‘माऽमङ्गलं तात परेष्वमंस्था<br>

<p>“ Child, do not think ill of others; for man but reaps the misery he has caused to others. Suruchi hath spoken but truth ; for you have been borne in the womb of an unfortunate woman. Worship the desire the lotus-feet of God Hari if you desire high seat like Uttama. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>एवं सञ्जल्पितं मातुराकयर्थागमं वचः।<br>

<p>Hearing his mother&rsquo;s words thusblabbered (in grief), words which were (destined) to accomplish his object, Dhruva controlled his mind himself and went out of his father&rsquo;s city.</p>

<p>Hearing of that (Ceparture of Dhruva) and understanding what he desired to do, Narada (who met him) touched him on his head with his sin-destroying palm and wondering (at him), said:</p>
<p><strong>‘नाधुनाऽप्यवमानं ते संमानं वाऽपि पुत्रक।<br>

<p>&ldquo;Child, to you who are yet a boy engrossed with your toys and the like, I do not see how any insult or honour is possible.</p>

<p>“Though there is the difference of insult and honour, there are (really) nocauses for discontent for a man except his ignorance; for, in (this) world, men aredifferent because of their own actions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, may you turn back; this tenacity of thine is futile; thou is futile; thou shouldst make (all these) efforts when the propitious time comes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man should desire to be pleased with one who is superior to him in endowments; to be sympathetic to one who is inferior in endowments; and should seek friendliness with one who is equal in in endowments ; (doing thus), he is not heart-burnings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;(Therefore), O, Brahmin sage! tell the successful path to me who am desirous of winning that place which would be the highest in (all) the three worlds, a place which neither our ancestors nor others ever occupied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Narada—</p>
<p>&ldquo;The path which your mother told you of is for your salvation. Therefore, my child,may welfare attend you; go to the pure bankof the Yamuna, the forest of Madhuvanawhere there is the eternalpresence ofGod Hari.

<p>According to sage Narada&rsquo;s instruction, he attentively worshipped the Supreme Being. Contemplating the Brahman, he stood on one leg, motionless like the trunk of a tree. As he was holding his mind on the Brahman, the three worlds shook.</p>

<p>Suddenly losing sight of Him who was flashing like a lightning within the lotusbud of his heart, as a result of his intellect becoming keen by the keen by the fruition of the Yoga, Dhruva (opened his eyes) and saw Him standing outside in the same manner.</p>

<p>With fear coming upon him on seeing the Lord, the boy (Dhruva) prostrated himself on the ground, throwing his body down like a stick, looking at Him intently as if he were drinking Him in with his eyes, appearing to kiss Him with his mouth and embrace Him with numerous arms.</p>
<p><strong>स तंविवक्षन्तमतद्विदं हरि—<br>

<p>Lord Hari, who is established in his as well as all all others&rsquo; hearts, finding him desirous of speaking but innocent of speech, kindly touched on the on the cheek, with his conch which embodies the Vedas, the boy who was was (standing) with folded hands.</p>
<p><strong>स वै तदैव प्रतिपद्य तां गिरं<br>
तं भक्तिभावोऽभ्यगृणाद् ध्रुवक्षितिः॥</strong></p>
<p>Obtaining the power of speech at that very moment, Dhruva for whom God had already reserved a permanent place, sang of Him in his devotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obeisance unto you, the Lord and Supreme Being who holds within Him all powers and who, entering me, kindles to life with His power this speech of mine that was dormant, as also my hands, feet, ears, the senses of touch and the rest, and my very life-breaths.</p>

<p>* After Dhruva, his eldest son Utkala having become desireless of kingdom, his next son Vatsara became king. Vatsara&rsquo;s wife gave birth to six sons; the eldest of these, Pushparna begot six sons on his two wives. The last of these, Vyushta, had a son named Sarvatejas by his wife named Pushkarini. Of Sarvatejas and Akuti was born the Manu named Chakshus. Chakshusha Manu had twelve sons, the last of whom, Ulmuka begot six sons, the eldest of whom was Anga.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, from thieves and from the tyrant, from both the sides, is the world faced with great calamity, like a log of wood burning at both ends. Out of fear for anarchy, this undeserving Vena was made king and from him also has fear come now. How can there be welfare for the people? Vena is wicked by nature and he desires to destroy the subjects. Still we shall pacify him so that the sin of having made him king shall not attach to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord is pleased with that King in whose country and city, Oblessed king ! the Lord is worshipped by the people; and what is unattainable when that King of kings is pleased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>“As a man carrying a heavy burden on his head bears it (now) on his shoulder, even so are all remedies. Action by itself can never be the final remedy for Actions; for both proceed from nescience; O sinless soul ! it is like a dream within a dream!</p>

<p>That (other) son of the king (Manu), Priyavrata¹, a very great devotee of the Lord, who had learnt the Truth by service at the feet of Narada, was called upon by his father (Manu) to protect the world, but for the sake of uninterrupted contemplation of Lord Vasudeva, (he) did not relish (that duty).</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________</p>

<li>Priyavrata was brother of Uttanapada, father of Dhruva. The mapping out of the globe into the seven oceans and seven continents is said to date from the time of this Priyavrata who is described as having gone round the world many times.</li>

<p><strong>तस्य एणकुणक उच्चैरेतस्मिन् कृतनिजाभिमानस्याहरहः तत्पोषणपालनलालनप्रीणनानुध्यानेनात्मनियमा एकैकशः कतिपयेनाहर्गणेन सर्व रवोदवसन्।</strong></p>
<p>Towards this little deer, Bharata formed the strong attachment that it was his own, and as a result of his daily nourishing it, protecting it (from wild beasts), fondling it, satisfying its wants and continuous thinking of it, all his austerities, one by one, became extinct in a few days.</p>
<p>** तस्यैवमन्तरायविहतयोगारम्भणस्य भरतस्य दुरतिक्रमः काल आपद्यत।**</p>
<p>To that Bharata whose Yoga was thus destroyed by the obstacle (of the young deer), there came the inescapable time of death.</p>
<p><strong>मृग एवाभिनिवेशितमना विसृज्य लोकमिमं मृगशरीरमवाप। तत्राप्यात्मनो मृगत्वकारणमनुस्मृत्य भृशमनुतप्यमानो विसृज्य मृगीं मातरं पुनर्भगवत्क्षेत्रं पुलस्त्य पुलहाश्रमं प्रत्याजगाम॥</strong></p>
<p>Passing away with a mind mind absorbed in the deer only, he was born (again) as a deer. (But) even in that deer-body, he thought of the cause for his becoming a deer and repenting very much, left his mother-doe, and again returned to the Lord&rsquo;s own realm, the hermitage of (sages) Pulastya and Pulaha.</p>
<p><strong>तस्मिन्नपि शुष्कपर्णरणवीरुधा वर्तमानो मृगत्वनिमित्तावसानमेव गणयन् मृगशरीरमुत्ससर्ज।</strong></p>
<p>There, he lived lived on dried leaves, grass and creepers, counting the time for the expiry of the Karma that caused him to be born as a deer and (then) left his deer-body.</p>
<p>** अथ कस्यचिद् द्विजवरस्य नवसोदर्या अङ्गजा बभूवुः, मिथुनं च यवीयस्यां भार्यायाम्। यस्तु तत्र पुमान् तं परमभागवतं भरतमुत्सृष्टमृगशरीरं चरमशरीरेण विप्रत्वं गतमाहुः॥**</p>
<p>Then, there were born to an excellent Brahmin nine sons by one wife, and by the younger wife twins, a son and a</p>
<p>daughter. The male-child of the twins, they say, was the great devotee Bharata who had left the deer-body and had become a Brahmin in his last birth.</p>
<p><strong>तत्रापि स्वजनसङ्गाद् भृशमुद्विजमानो भगवदनुग्रहेणानुस्मृतस्वपूर्वजन्मावलिरात्मानमत्त जडान्धबधिरस्वरूपेण दर्शयामास लोकस्य। शीतोष्णवातवर्षेष्वनावृताविचचार॥</strong></p>
<p>In that birth also, he was terribly afraid of attachment to his kith and kin and remembering, by God&rsquo;s grace, the series of his previous births, he exhibited himself to the world as a man mad, insensate, blind, and deaf. With an uncovered body, he wandered about in cold, heat, storm and rain.</p>
<p><strong>अथ कदाचित्कश्चिद्वृषलपतिर्भद्रकाल्यै पुरुषपशुमालभतापत्यकामः। तदनुचरा निशि एनं बद्ध्वारशनया चण्डिकागृहमुपनिन्दुः। अथ वृषलराजपणिः पुरुषपशोरसृगासवेन देवीं यक्ष्यमाणोऽसिमुपाददे॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, on an occasion, a certain banditchief, desiring issue, decided to offer a human sacrifice to Goddess Bhadrakali. His followers bound Bharata with a rope in the night and brought him to the temple of Chandika (Bhadrakali). Then, the bandit who was officiating as the priest of the banditchief took the sword for propitiating the Goddess with the wine of the blood of that human offering.</p>
<p><strong>इति तेषां वृषलानां रजस्तमःप्रकृतीनां हिंसाविहाराणां कर्मातिदारुणं यद्ब्रह्मभूतस्य निर्वैरस्य सर्वभूतसुहृदोऽननुमतमालम्भनं तदुपलभ्य सहसोच्चचाट सैव देवी।</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that highly heinous act of those low men of passion and delusion, delighting in violence, namely, the bad impermissible become the killing of one who Brahman, one from whom enmity had completely departed and one who was a friend of all beings, the Goddess Herself suddenly burst out of the image.</p>
<p>** महाट्टहासं विमुञ्चन्त्युत्पत्य पापीयसां तेनैवासिना विवृक्णशीर्ष्णामसृगासवं निपीय जगौ ननर्त च। एवमेव महदभिचारातिक्रमः कार्त्स्न्येनात्मने फलति॥**</p>
<p>Laughing a terrific laugh, she jumped and with the same sword cut off the heads of those evil men, drank the wine of their blood, and sang, and danced. Thus indeed does the sin of torturing the great completely turnagainst the sinner (himself).</p>
<p><strong>न वा एतन्महदद्भुतं यदसंभ्रमः स्वशिरश्छेदन आपतितेऽपि विमुक्तदेहाद्यात्मभाव-सुदृढहृदयग्रन्थीनाम्।</strong></p>
<p>Nor is this composure even when one&rsquo;s decapitation is imminent any great wonder in those who have cast away that strong knot of the heart, the mistaken sense of soul in body and other material objects.</p>
<p><strong>अथ सिन्धुसौवीरपते रहूगणस्य व्रजत इक्षुमत्यास्तटे शिबिकावहपुरुषान्वेषणसमये स द्विजवर</strong></p>
<p><strong>उपलब्ध एष पीवा युवा धुरं वोढुमलमिति पूर्वविष्टिगृहीतैस्सह गृहीतः प्रसभमतदर्द्धमुवाह शिबिकां स महानुभावः।</strong></p>
<p>Then, while Rahugana, king of the Sindhus and the Sauviras, was on a journey along the bank of the Ikshumati, and a search was made for palanquin–bearers, this eminent Brahmin, Jadabharata, was found. “Stout and youthful, this man is capable of bearing the burden”—thus was he forcibly caught hold of, along with others previously conscribed, and that great man undeservingly carried the palanquin.</p>
<p><strong>यदा हि न समाहिता पुरुषगतिः, तदा विषमगतां स्वशिबिकां रहूगण उपधार्याह किं विषममुह्यते यानमिति।</strong></p>
<p>When the movement of the bearers was not uniform, Rahugana found his palanquin moving irregularly and said: “Why is the vehicle carried unevenly?”<br>
<strong>पुरुषाः—</strong></p>
<p>** ‘वयं नरदेव साध्वेव वहामः। अयमधुनैव नियुक्तो न द्रुतं व्रजति, नानेन सह वोढुं पारयाम इति।’**</p>
<p>(The bearers said:) “King, we are carrying (the palanquin) aright but this recently recruited person does not proceed fast and we are not able to carry it along with him.”</p>
<p><strong>राजा रहुगण उपासितवृद्धोऽपि ईषदुत्थितमन्युरविस्पष्टब्रह्मतेजसं रजसावृतमतिराह—</strong></p>
<p>King Rahugana, though he was one who had sat at the feet of the great, became a little angry and with mind sullied thereby, told Bharata whose Brahminic effulgence was not apparent:</p>
<p>** ‘अहो कष्टं भ्रातः! व्यक्तमुरु परिश्रान्तो,दीर्घमध्वानमेक एव ऊहिवान् सुचिरम्, नातिपीवा, न संहननाङ्गो, जरसा चोपद्रुतो भवान् !’**</p>
<p>“Alas brother, what a misery! Clearly, you are very tired! Singly and for long, you have been carrying (the palanquin) a long way! You are not very stout or sturdy in limbs and you are decrepit !”</p>
<p><strong>इति विप्रलब्धोऽपि ब्रह्मभूतस्तूष्णीं शिबिकां पूर्ववदुवाद।</strong></p>
<p>Though scolded ironically in this manner, Bharata, who had become the Brahran, silently bore the palanquin as before.</p>
<p><strong>अथ प्रकुपित उवाच रहूगणः ‘किं भर्तृशासनमतिचरसि, प्रमत्तस्य च ते करोमि चिकित्साम्’ इति।</strong></p>
<p>Then Rahugana, becoming very angry, told him: “Why do you disobey the order of the master? I will give the (proper) remedy (of punishment) to you who are negligent.”</p>
<p><strong>एवमबद्धं भाषमाणं नरदेवाभिमानं स भगवान् ब्राह्मणो ब्रह्मभूतस्सर्वःभूतसुहृदात्मा स्मयमान इदमाह।</strong></p>
<p>That blessed Brahmin, who had become the Brahman and whose soul had become the friend of all beings, said this with a smile to that Rahugana who was prattling in that manner and was proud of being a king:</p>
<p><strong>‘स्थौल्यं कार्श्यं व्याधय आधयश्च<br>

देहेन जातस्य हि मे न सन्ति।</strong></p>
<p>Stoutness, leanness, physical ills, mental anguish, the fear of hunger and thirst, quarrel, desire, old age, sleep, enjoyment, anger, the intoxicating sense of I, sorrows,―these exist for him who is born in the flesh, not for me (who am born in spirit).</p>
<p><strong>‘स्वस्वाम्यभावो ध्रुव ईड्य यत्र<br>
तर्ह्युच्यतेऽसौ विधिकृत्ययोगः॥</strong></p>
<p>“O praiseworthy king! if the relation of servant and master is eternal, then there shall be this relation betweenorder and service.</p>
<p><strong>‘विशेषबुद्धेर्विवरं मनाक् च<br>
पश्याम यन्न व्यवहारतोऽन्यत्।<br>
क इश्वरस्तत्र किमीशितव्यं<br>

<p>“Except in words, we do not see any occasion for the sense of difference (of master and servant). When the fact is such, who is the lord and what is there to be lorded over? Still, O king, what shall we do for you?</p>
<p><strong>‘उन्मत्तमत्तजडवत्स्वसंस्थां<br>
गतस्य मे वीर चिकित्सितेन।<br>
अर्थः कियान्भवता शिक्षितेन<br>

<p>“O heroic king! of what avail is the remedy of your punishment to me who, though looking like one mad, intoxicated or insensate, am really one who has attained selfhood? And if I were really stupid or mad, your punishment would be (all the more ) futile.”</p>
<p><strong>तावत्प्रत्युदीर्य मुनिवर उपभोगेन कर्मारब्धंव्यपनयन् राजयानमुवाह।</strong></p>
<p>Having replied this much, that eminent sage, who was living out the fruits of those past actions which had begun to<br>
bear fruit, carried the royal vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>स चापि तद्हृदयग्रन्थिमोचनं द्विजवच आश्रुत्य, त्वरयाऽवरुह्य शिरसा पादमूलमुपसृतः क्षमापयन् विगतनृपदेवस्मय उवाच।</strong></p>
<p>And Rahugana, on hearing those words of the eminent Brahmin which cut the knot of nescience, got down (from his</p>
<p>palanquin) in haste, bowed at his feet, and with his pride of kingship gone, begged pardon of him and said:</p>
<p><strong>‘कस्त्वं निगूढश्चरसीह कस्मात्<br>

<p>“Who are you that move about here in disguise, and wherefore? If you are here for my welfare, may you not be the pure Lord Himself? I am on my way to enquire (what my refuge is) of Kapila, the first preceptor of all sages. May it be that thou art Himself?</p>
<p><strong>‘तन्मे भवान्नरदेवाभिमान-<br>

<p>“Therefore, O, you friend of the suffering, you must grace with a look of friendliness me who have, in the intoxication of my pride of kingship, slighted the noblest of men; so only may I escape escape the sin of insulting the good.”</p>
<p>** जडभरतः—**</p>
<p><strong>‘गुणानुरक्तं व्यसनाय जन्तोः<br>
क्षेमाय नैर्गुण्यमथो मनस्स्यात्॥</strong></p>
<p>** Jadabharata— **</p>
<p>“Attached to material objects of enjoyment, the mind of beings makes for their misery, but if it is freed of such objects, it makes for welfare.</p>
<p><strong>‘न यावदेतां तनुभृनरेन्द्र<br>

<p><strong>न यावदेतन्मन आत्मलिङ्गं<br>

<p>“King! so long as man does not shake off this nescience as a result of the rise of knowledge, and leaving off (all) attachments and conquering the six enemies (Desire, Anger, Avarice, Delusion, Pride and Malice), does not realise the Truth of Self, so long as he does not understand this</p>
<p>mind which conditions the (unconditioned) soul as the soil that produces the agonies of births and deaths of man, so long does man wander here (in the world of birth and death).</p>
<p><strong>‘भ्रातृव्यमेनं तददभ्रवीर्यम्<br>

<p>“Therefore, lay aside your carelessness, and with the sword of the worship at the feet of your preceptor and the Lord, slay this very powerful enemy of yours, which has grown powerful by (sheer) negligence, this mind which is unreal in itself but has deprived you of your soul.</p>
<p><strong>‘अयं जनो नाम चलन्पृथिव्यां<br>

<p>“King! this something of earth, if it moves about in the world for some reason, comes to</p>
<p>be known as man; and to that earthen form, there are, above its feet, the ankles, the shanks, the thighs, the hip, the chest, the neck and the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>‘असेऽधिदार्वी शिबिका च यस्यां<br>

<p>“And on the shoulder, there is is the wooden palanquin and in it there is the name ‘King of the Sauviras’; and with the sense of mine grown strong in that name, you imagine yourself to be the king of the Sindhus and become blinded by that false pride.</p>

<p>“Forcibly conscribing these pitiable people rendered miserable by the great toil (of carrying you ), you are indeed merciless.</p>
<p>Boasting that you are the protector of the people, you, who are audacious, do not shine in the assemblies of the learned.</p>

<p>“Pure knowledge is the one Truth, and that, the men of vision say, is Lord Vasudeva. Rahugana, this man does not attain to by penance, sacrificial rite, libation, or household life; not by recitation of the Veda, never by worship of Water, Fire or Sun. It cannot be attained except by bathing oneself in the dust of the feet of the great.</p>
<p><strong>‘तस्मान्नरोऽसङ्गसुसङ्गजात-<br>

<p>“Therefore cutting here itself his delusion with the sword of knowledge born of the association with those who have no attachments, and acquiring the constant thought (of the Lord) by speaking of and listening to His acts, acts, man reaches Hari, crossing the end of the road of this world.</p>
<p><strong>‘रहूगण त्वमपि ह्यध्वनोऽस्य<br>

<p>“Rahugana, laying aside aside the role of punishing (others) and making friends with all beings, with your soul untouched by (objects of enjoyment) and arming yourself with the sword of knowledge, sharp with the service of Lord Hari, you also cross over the other end of this highway.”</p>
<p><strong>इत्येवं स सिन्धुपतय आत्मसतत्त्वं परमकारुणिकतया उपदिश्य आपूर्णार्णव इव निभृतकरणोर्म्याशयो धरणिमिमां विचचार।</strong></p>
<p>Having thus, out of his great compassion, imparted the Truth of Self to the king of the Sindhus, Jadabharata wandered over this earth, looking like the full ocean, the waves of action in his mind having become still.</p>
<p>** सौवीरपतिरपि आत्मन्यविद्ययाऽध्यारोपितां देहात्ममतिंविससर्ज। एवं हि भगवदाश्रिताश्रितानुभावः।**<br>
And the king of the Sauviras also cast away the sense of soul in the body, which has been superimposed on the self by nescience. Such is the greatness of those that resort to God&rsquo;s devotees.</p>

<p>**King Parikshit— **</p>
<p>“Though knowing sin to be harmful to oneself from (both) the visible (society,elders and state) and the ethical Institutes one learns, one ( still) commits sin, unable to control oneself; and of what avail are expiatory rites then ?”</p>

<p><strong>Suka—</strong></p>
<p>The annihilation of sin by expiatory rites is not considered as final; for the expiatory rites are prescribed for those who are notmen of knowledge. Knowledge is expiation.</p>
<p><strong>नाश्नतः पथ्यमेवान्नं व्याधयोऽभिभवन्ति हि।<br>

<p>Diseases assail not him who eats only wholesome food; even so, the person of disciplined life gradually qualifies himself for ( ultimate) welfare.</p>

<p><strong>अत्र चोदाहरन्तीममितिहासं पुरातनम्।<br>

<p>And on this subject they tell an old story also, a conversation between the messengers of God Vishnu and Yama (the God of Death):</p>
<p><strong>कन्यकुब्जे द्विजः कश्चिद्दासीपतिरजामिलः।<br>
नाम्ना नष्टसदाचारो दास्याः संसर्गदूषितः॥</strong></p>
<p>There was a Brahmin in Kanyakubja, Ajamila by name, the husband of a prostitute, with all his righteous conduct lost and polluted by association with the harlot.</p>
<p><strong>बन्द्यक्षकैतवैश्चौर्यैर्गर्हितां वृत्तिमाश्रितः।<br>
बिभ्रत्कुटुम्बमशुचिर्यातयामास देहिनः॥</strong></p>
<p>Adopting despicable means of livelihood, sycophancy, gambling and theft, and maintaining his family impurely, that Ajamila was torturing people.</p>
<p><strong>तस्य प्रवयसः पुत्रा दश तेषां तु योऽवमः।<br>

<p>To him, who had become very old, there were (born) ten sons, of whom the last was a boy named Narayana, a darling of the parents. Doting on that child, the old man was extremely happy.</p>
<p><strong>स एवं वर्तमानोऽज्ञो मृत्युकाल उपस्थिते।<br>
मतिंचकार तनये बाले नारायणाह्वये॥</strong></p>
<p>Living in this manner, the ignorant Ajamila, when the time of death approached, fixed his mind on that young son of his named Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>स पाशहस्तांस्त्रीन्दृष्ट्वा पुरुषान्भृशदारुणान्।<br>

<p>Seeing three terrific persons with nooses in their hands, Ajamila, with his senses bewildered, called out in a long-drawn voice for his son named Narayana who who was engrossed in his dolls at a distance.</p>
<p><strong>निशम्य म्रियमाणस्य ब्रुवतो हरिकीर्तनम्।<br>

<p>Hearing the name of their Lord from that dying person who was uttering the name of Hari, the attendants of the Lord rushed (to him) in haste.</p>
<p><strong>विकर्षतोऽन्तर्हृदयाद्दासीपतिमजामिलम्।<br>

<p>The messengers of Vishnu forcibly prevented the servants of Yama who were dragging from out of the heart, (the soul of) Ajamila, the husband of the prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>ऊचुर्निषेधितास्तांस्ते वैवस्वतपुरस्सराः॥</strong></p>
<p>Those forerunners of Yama, who were obstructed, told the messengers of Vishnu:</p>
<p><strong>‘वेदप्रणिहितो धर्मो ह्यधर्मस्तद्विपर्ययः।<br>
वेदो नारायणस्साक्षात्स्वयंभूरिति शुश्रुम॥</strong></p>
<p>“Dharma is that which is inculcated by the Veda; its opposite is Adharma; and we have heard that the Veda is the self-born God Narayana Himself.</p>
<p><strong>‘सर्वे कर्मानुरोधेन दण्डमर्हन्ति कारिणः॥</strong></p>
<p>“All those who commit sin deserve punishment in accordance with what they have done.</p>

<p>“This person (Ajamila) was a Brahmin, endowed with learning and the abode of character, conduct and other virtues; once, having gone to the forest to do the bidding of his father, he saw a lewd low-caste fellow in the company of a harlot, dallying, singing and laughing with her who was by his side.</p>
<p><strong>‘दृष्ट्वातां कामलिप्तेन बाहुना परिरम्भिताम्।<br>

<p>“Seeing her embraced by that lustful person with his arm, this Ajamila became infatuated at once once and a prey to passion.</p>
<p><strong>‘तामेव मनसा ध्यायन् स्वधर्माद्विरराम ह।<br>

<p>“Thinking of her alone, he stopped performing his Dharma; and with all his available patrimony, he satisfied her alone.</p>
<p><strong>‘विप्रां स्वभार्यामप्रौढां कुले महति लम्भिताम्।<br>

<p>“With his mind pierced by the side-long glances of the wanton woman, the sinner, Ajamila, soon abandoned his own wife, a Brahmin lady, not yet of age, and married out of a great family.</p>
<p><strong>‘यतस्ततश्चोपनिन्ये न्यायतोऽन्यायतो धनम्।<br>

<p><strong>The Lord&rsquo;s messengers—</strong></p>
<p>“This Ajamila has done the expiation for even the sins of a crore of births, since involuntarily he spoke the name of Hari, the path to welfare.</p>

<p>“The name of God uttered consciously or unconsciously will burn away the sin of man, even as fire would burn fuel. Like very effective medicine taken in accidentally, a Mantra uttered does its good even to him who knows not its effect.</p>

<p>Released from the noose (of death), the Brahmin, with his fear gone, regained his normal state and as a result of listening to the greatness of the Lord (from his messengers), quickly became a devotee of God.</p>

<p>Recapitulating his sins, he repented intensely: Alas!

Fie upon me, accursed by the good, the sinner and blot on my family, who abandoned a young and faithful wife and went over to the drunkard-harlot! Alas! ungratefully and like a low person, I have now neglected my poor parents, who are old, helpless and have no kin besides myself!</p>

<p>Thus, with complete disgust for worldly enjoyment, born in him as a result of a moment&rsquo;s association with the good, Ajamila came to the head of the Ganges, casting away all attachments.</p>

<p>The servants of Yama whose efforts were set at naught by the servants of the Lord, submitted to their master Yama, the lord of Samyamini (the city of justice)ः</p>

<p>Transgressing the righteous path in the pride of the sovereignty of the three worlds, Indra (once) failed to rise, offer a seat and do similar honour to the eminent sage Vachaspati, revered by both gods and demons, on his arrival.</p>
<p><strong>ततो निर्गत्य सहसा विद्वान् श्रीमदविक्रियाम्।<br>

<p>Going out of Indra’s court all of a sudden, and knowing as he did the evil effect of the pride of prosperity, Brihaspati became invisible by his spiritual power.</p>
<p><strong>तच्छ्रुत्वैवासुरास्सर्व आश्रित्यौशनसं मतम्।<br>

<p>As soon as they heard of that disappearance of the preceptor of the gods, the maddened demons resorted to the advice of (their preceptor) Sukra and, determined to kill the gods, attacked them.</p>
<p><strong>ब्रह्माणं शरणं जग्मुस्सहेन्द्रा नतकन्धराः।<br>
तांस्तथाऽभ्यर्दितान्देव उवाच परिसान्त्वयन्॥</strong></p>
<p>With heads bent in reverence, the gods, with Indra, sought refuge in Brahma. God Brahma consoled the gods who were put to severe distress in that manner and told them:</p>
<p><strong>‘अहो बत सुरश्रेष्ठा ह्यभद्रं वः कृतं महत्।<br>
ब्रह्मिष्ठं ब्राह्मणं दान्तमैश्वर्यान्नाभ्यनन्दत॥</strong></p>
<p>“Alas! you eminent gods! a great wrong has been committed by you, you who in your power did not honour the Brahmin (Brihaspati), a person of self-realisation and self-control.</p>
<p><strong>‘तद्विश्वरूपं भजताशु विप्रं<br>

<p>“Therefore, quick, seek seek the Brahmin Visvarupa, a man of penance and self- possession, the son of Tvashta. Honoured (by you), he will do for you the things (you want), if only you tolerate his action (his partiality for the demons).”</p>
<p><strong>त एवमुदितास्त्वाष्ट्रमुपव्रज्येदमब्रुदन्॥</strong></p>
<p>So told, the gods approached Visvarupa, the son of Tvashta, and said this:</p>
<p><strong>‘वृणीमहे त्वोपाध्यायं ब्रह्मिष्ठं ब्राह्मणं गुरुम्।<br>
यथाऽञ्जसा विजेष्यामस्सपत्नांस्तव तेजसा॥’</strong></p>
<p>“We beseech you, you, a Brahmin of selfrealisation and one fit to be a preceptor, to become our preceptor so that, with your power, we shall conquer our enemies with ease.”</p>
<p><strong>विश्वरूपः</strong>—</p>
<p><strong>‘कथं विगर्ह्यं नु करोम्यधीश्वराः<br>
पौरोधसं हृष्यति येन दुर्मतिः॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Visvarupa—</strong></p>
<p>“Masters! how shall I undertake priestcraft, a despicable act which only a low mind delights in?</p>
<p><strong>‘तथाऽपि प्रार्थितं सर्वं प्राणैरर्थैश्च साधये॥’</strong></p>
<p>“Still, I shall accomplish (for you), with all my life and resources, all that you have requested (of me).”</p>

<p>Having thus promised to the gods, the powerful Visvarupa of great penance snatched and gave to Indra, by (the power)</p>
<p>of the Mantra of Lord Vishnu, the fortune of the enemies of the gods, though it was<br>
protected by the power of Sukra&rsquo;s magic-lore.</p>
<p><strong>तस्यासन् विश्वरूपस्य शिरांसि त्रीणि [भारत]।<br>

<p>That Visvarupa had three heads.In his sacrifice, he pronounced loudly, in sight of all and with modesty, the share of the offering due to the gods, who were his kin on his father&rsquo;s side; and the same person gave the demons their share, secretly; performing his sacrifice, Visvarupa gave their share (to the demons), impelled by his love for his mother.*</p>
<p><strong>तद्देवहेलनं तस्य धर्मालीकं सुरेश्वरः।<br>

<p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p>* Aditi, a wife of Kasyapa, produced many sons, one of whom was Tvashta. Tvashta married Racana, the sister of a demon and of the two was Visvarupa born. Thus, through his father, Visvarupa is a grandson of the gods and through his mother, a nephew of the demons.</p>
<p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that insult of the gods and pretended Dharma of Visvarupa, Indra, the king of the gods, afraid (of Visvarupa&rsquo;s attachment to the demons) quickly cut offhis heads in anger.</p>
<p><strong>हतपुत्रस्ततस्त्वष्टा जुहावेन्द्राय शत्रवे।<br>

<p>Then, Tvashta whose son (Visvarupa) had been killed, made offerings in fire to create an enemy of Indra. And then, there arose out of the fire at the southern end, a terrible being; that very frightful evil spirit was called Vritra.</p>
<p><strong>तं निजघ्नुरभिद्रुत्य सगणा विबुधर्षभाः।<br>
स्वैस्स्वैर्दिव्यास्त्रशस्त्रौघैस्सोऽग्रसत्तानि कृत्स्नशः॥</strong></p>
<p>The great gods attacked Vritra with their followers and struck him with their respective divine missiles and weapons. And Vritra swallowed them completely.</p>
<p><strong>ततस्त आदिपुरुषमुपतस्थुस्समाहिताः॥</strong></p>
<p>Then the gods praised the Prime Being with concentrated minds.</p>
<p><strong>अभूदाविर्हरिः प्राह &lsquo;प्रीतोऽहं विबुधर्षभाः।<br>

<p><strong>ततस्तैरायुधश्रेष्ठोविश्वकर्मविनिर्मितः।<br>
येन वृत्रशिरोहर्ता मत्तेजउपबृंहितः॥’</strong></p>
<p>Lord Hari manifested Himself and told: “Great gods! I am pleased (with your prayer). Indra, may welfare attend you all; go to that eminent sage Dadhichi and beg of him his body, strong with his Mantra, austerities and penances; tarry not. Sought by you, that sage who knows the Dharma will give his limbs (to you) andthen, there shall be an excellent weapon made out of those limbs by Visvakarman, by which, you shall, reinforced by my power, take off the head of Vritra.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>इन्द्रमेवं समादिश्य तत्रैवान्तर्दधे हरिः॥</strong></p>
<p>Having directed Indra thus, Hari disappeared at that very place.</p>
<p><strong>तथाऽभियाचितो देवैर्ऋषिराथर्वणो महान्।<br>
‘किन्नु तद्दुस्त्यजं ब्रह्मन्पुंसां भूतानुकम्पिनाम्॥’</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Dadhichi was accordingly besought by the gods (for his limbs): “O Brahmin! for men who are compassionate towards beings, what is there that is too hard to part with?”</p>
<p>** ऋषिः—**</p>
<p><strong>“योऽध्रुवेणात्मना नाथा न धर्मं न यशः पुमान्।<br>
ईहेत भूतदयया स शोच्यः स्थावरैरपि॥”</strong></p>
<p>The sage—</p>
<p>“Masters! he is to be pitied even by inanimate things who, with kindness to beings, desires not (to secure) through his impermanent body Dharma or fame.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>एवं कृतव्यवसितो दध्यङ्ङाथर्वणस्तनुम्।<br>
परे भगवति ब्रह्मण्यात्मानं संनयञ्जहौ॥</strong></p>
<p>Having determined thus, Dadhichi offered his soul to the Supreme Lord, the Brahman, and gave up his body.</p>
<p><strong>अथेन्द्रो वज्रमुद्यम्य निर्मितं विश्वकर्मणा।<br>

<p>Then, taking up the thunderbolt made by Visvakarman with the bones of sage Dadhichi, elated Indra, backed up by the power of the Lord, attacked Vritra for cutting him (to pieces), like angry Rudra attacking the god of death himself.</p>
<p><strong>ततस्सुराणामसुरैरणः परमदारुणः॥</strong></p>
<p>Then there was a very terrific battle between the gods and the demons.</p>
<p><strong>सर्वे प्रयासा अभवन्विमोघाः<br>

पलायनायाजिमुखे विसृज्य<br>

<p>All the efforts the demons made against the gods were repeatedly rendered futile. Deprived of their strength, they made up their minds to forsake their master (Vritra) at the war-front, and flee.</p>
<p><strong>वृत्रोऽसुरांस्ताननुगान्मनस्वी<br>

लोको यशश्चाथ ततो यदि ह्यमुं<br>

<p>The firm-minded Vritra, seeing those Asura-followers of his fleeing, said this: &ldquo;Death is certain for everybody that is born, this death for which there is no remedy here. If through that death, there is going to be the heaven of the heroes and renown, who will not welcome it when it comes?</p>
<p><strong>त एवं शंसतो धर्मं वचः पत्युरचेतसः।<br>
नैवागृह्णन् भयत्रस्ताः पलायनपरा [नृप]॥</strong></p>
<p>Having lost their senses and intent on running away, the panic-stricken demons heeded not the words of their master who was thus speaking what was righteous.</p>
<p><strong>स इन्द्रशत्रुः कुपितो भृशं मृधे<br>

<p>Highly infuriated in that battle, the enemy of Indra (Vritra) beheld (Indra) the murderer of his own brother armed with the thunderbolt, and remembering that sinful and wicked act of his, became sorrowful and clouded in mind, and spoke laughing (derisively):</p>
<p><strong>‘दिष्ट्या भवान्मे समवस्थितो रिपुः<br>

<p>“Luckily you are standing before me as my enemy, you who are the murderer of a Brahmin, the murderer of a preceptor, the murderer of a brother! Luckily, O, you evil Indra, I shall now requite quickly by shattering your stone-heart with my trident.</p>
<p><strong>‘सुरेश कस्मान्न हिनोषि वज्रं<br>

<p>“King of the gods, why do you not aim your unfailing thunderbolt at me, your enemy standing in front of you? Indra, this thunderbolt is sharp not with your power, it is sharp by the power of God Hari and the penance of (sage) Dadhichi. Directed by Lord Vishnu, kill your enemy with that weapon itself. Where Lord Hari is, there victory, prosperity and all excellences are.</p>
<p><strong>‘अहं समाधाय मनो यथाऽऽह<br>

<p>“As God said, I shall concentrate my mind on His lotus-feet and with my ties of attachment to low things cut by the force of your thunderbolt, and casting off this body, I shall reach the sages goal.”</p>
<p><strong>एवं जिहासुः [नृप] देहमाजौ<br>

<p>Desiring thus to lay down his body in the battle, considering as he did death better than victory, Vritra ran at Indra, grasping his trident, and spoke in anger: “Sinner! you are killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>हनौ तताडेन्द्रमथामरेभं<br>
वज्रं च हस्तान्न्यपतन्मघोनः॥</strong></p>
<p>Vritra then struck Indra, the chief of the gods, on the chin; and the thunderbolt fell from the hand of Indra.</p>
<p><strong>इन्द्रो न वज्रं जगृहे विलज्जित-<br>

<p>Ashamed, Indra did not take up, in the presence of his enemy, the thunderbolt that had slipped down from his hand. Vritra told him: “Indra, take the thunderbolt and kill your enemy; this is no time for sorrow.”</p>
<p><strong>‘लोकास्सपाला यस्येमे श्वसन्ति विवशा वशे।<br>

<p>“Time is the cause (of everything) here, Time under whose control, these worlds with their guardians live helplessly, like birds caught in a net. Not understanding that Time is energy, power, strength, life, immortality and death, man regards his foolish self as the cause.</p>
<p><strong>‘भूतैस्सृजति भूतानि ग्रसते तानि तैस्स्वयम्।<br>

<p>“God creates beings with beings and Himself destroys beings with beings. Life, fortune, fame, lordship and all the blessings of man appear in the time propitious for them, even as their opposites appear (at other times) though man does not wish for them.</p>
<p><strong>‘तस्मादकीर्तियशसोर्जयापजययोरपि।<br>

<p>“Therefore one should be equanimous in infamy and fame, defeat and victory, miscry and happiness, and death and life.”</p>
<p>** इन्द्रः—**</p>
<p><strong>‘अहो दानव सिद्धोऽसि यस्य ते मतिरीदृशी।<br>

<p>** Indra—**</p>
<p>“Hail, you demon! you have attained salvation, you whose mind has become thus; for you have cast away your demoniac nature and become a great man.”</p>
<p><strong>इति ब्रुवाणावन्योन्यं युयुधाते युधांपती॥</strong></p>
<p>Thus speaking to each other, the two chiefs of the warriors fought.</p>

<p>Vritra got at Indra and swallowed him along with his elephant. The powerful Indra tore his stomach with his thunderbolt, and getting out, forcefully chopped off his head, like the summit of a mountain.</p>
<p><strong>वृत्रस्य देहानिष्क्रान्तमात्मज्योतिः [अरिन्दम]।<br>

<p>Even as all the worlds were looking on, the effulgence of the Spirit that emanated from out of Vritra&rsquo;s body attained the Lord who is beyond all worlds.</p>

<p>Then, when the Supreme Being, the embodiment of all gods, was worshipped with sacrifice, that accumulation of sin due to the killing of the (Brahmin) sons of Tvashta, though very great, was completely removed by the Lord Himself, as mist is by the sun.</p>

<p><strong>THE STORY OF PRAHLADA</strong></p>

<p><strong>यथा वैरानुबन्धेन मर्त्यम्तन्मयतामियात्।<br>
न तथा भक्तियोगेन इति मे निश्चिता मतिः।<br>
वैरेण पूतपाप्मानस्तमापुरनुचिन्तया॥</strong></p>
<p>It is my decided opinion that man cannot become so much absorbed in God even through devotion, as he can through persistent enmity. Purified of their sins by their enmity, (the enemies of God) have attained Him through their continuous thought of Him.</p>
<p><strong>कामाढ्द्वेषाद्भयात्स्नेहाद्यथा भक्त्येश्वरे मनः।<br>
आवेश्य तदघं हित्वा बहवस्तद्गतिं गताः।<br>
गोप्यः कामाद भयात्कंसो द्वेषाच्चैद्यादयो नृपाः॥</strong></p>
<p>As in devotion, so also in love, hate, fear and friendship, many have concentrated their minds on God, cast off their sin and attained to His goal,—the shepherd-women in love, Kamsa in fear, and kings like Sisupala in hate.</p>
<p><strong>एकदा ब्रह्मणः पुत्रा विष्णुलोकं यदृच्छया।<br>
सनन्दनादयो जग्मुर्द्वाःस्थौ तान्प्रत्यषेधताम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Once, Sanandana and others, the sons of Brahma, went by chance to the world<br>
of Vishnu; the two door-keepers (there) prevented them (from entering).</p>
<p><strong>अशपन् ‘आसुरीं योनिं बालिशौ यातमाश्वतः॥</strong></p>
<p>The sages cursed (the two door-keepers): “Childish (Jaya and Vijaya)! away from here and quickly take demoniac births.”</p>
<p><strong>जज्ञाते तौदितेः पुत्रौ दैत्यदानववन्दितौ।<br>
हिरण्यकशिपुर्ज्येष्ठाेहिरण्याक्षोऽनुजाे हतः।<br>
हिरण्याक्षोधरोद्धारे बिभ्रता सौकरं वपुः॥</strong></p>
<p>The two door-keepers of Vishnu were born as the two sons of Diti, respected by all the demons, Hiranyakasipu the elder,</p>
<p>and Hiranyaksha, the younger. Hiranyaksha was killed by the Lord who took the form of the Boar, when He lifted the earth out of the waters.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>भ्रातर्येवं विनिहते हरिणा क्रोडमूर्तिना।<br>
हिरण्यकशिपुः [राजन्] पर्यतप्यद्रुषा शुचा॥</strong></p>
<p>When his brother had been killed thus by Hari in the form of the Boar, Hiranyakasipu burnt with anger and grief.</p>
<p><strong>कोपोज्ज्वलद्भ्यां चक्षुर्भ्यांदानवानिदमब्रवीत्।<br>
‘यत्रयत्र द्विजा गावो वेदा वर्णाश्रमाः क्रियाः।<br>
तंतं जनपदं यात सन्दीपयत वृश्चत॥’</strong></p>
<p>With eyes blazing with anger, he told this to the demons: “Wherever there are Brahmins, cows, Vedas, the preservation of Varna and Asrama and the practice of the duties of these, proceed to those places, and burn and slaughter.”</p>
<p><strong>हिरण्यकशिपुः [राजन्] अजेयमजरामरम्।<br>
आत्मानमप्रतिद्वन्द्वमेकराजं व्यधित्सत।<br>
स तेपे मन्दरद्रोण्यां तपः परमदारुणम्॥</strong></p>
<p>And Hiranyakasipu desired to make himself an invincible person, free from old age and death, and the sole monarch without a foe. (To this end) he performed very terrible penance in a ravine of the Mandara mountain.</p>
<p><strong>तस्मिंस्तपस्तप्यमाने जज्वलुश्च दिशो दश॥</strong></p>
<p>When he was performing penance, all the ten quarters were ablaze.</p>
<p><strong>तपन्तं तपसा लोकान् प्राह तं हंसवाहनः।<br>
‘वरदोऽहमनुप्राप्तो वियतामीप्सितो वरः’॥</strong></p>
<p>Brahma told that Hiranyakasipu who was burning the worlds with (the fire) of his penance : “I have come (here), the bestower of boons; choose your desired boon.”</p>
<p>हिरण्यकशिपुः—</p>
<p><strong>‘भूतेभ्यस्त्वद्विसृष्टेभ्यो मृत्युर्माभून्मम प्रभो।<br>

व्यसुभिर्वाऽसुमद्भिर्वा सुरासुरमहोरगैः॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hiranyakasipu :</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! let me not have death from any of the beings created by you; let me not have death indoors or outside, by day or night, or from any other thing, or by any weapons; let me not have death on the ground or in the air, by men or by animals, by animate or inanimate things, or from gods, demons or the great serpents.</p>
<p><strong>‘अप्रतिद्वन्द्वतां युद्ध ऐकपत्यं च देहिनाम्।<br>
सर्वेषां लोकपालानां महिमानं यथाऽऽत्मनः॥’</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;(Also bestow on me) the state of being without an opponent in battle, the sole sovereignty over men and the power of all the gods, a power like that you possess.</p>
<p><strong>वृतश्शतधृतिः प्रादाद् वरांस्तस्य सुदुर्लभान्॥</strong></p>
<p>Asked for boons (in that manner), Brahma gave him those boons hard to be obtained.</p>
<p><strong>एवं लब्धवरो दैत्यो बिभ्रद्धेममयं वपुः।<br>
भगवत्यकरोद् द्वेषं भ्रातुर्वधमनुस्मरन्॥</strong></p>
<p>Having thus obtained the boons, the demon, endowed with a golden body, began to hate the Lord, constantly remembering the killing of his brother.</p>
<p><strong>स विजित्य दिशस्सर्वा लोकांश्च त्रीन्महासुरः।<br>
जहार लोकपालानां स्थानानि सह तेजसा॥</strong></p>
<p>Conquering all the quarters and the three worlds, the great demon deprived the gods of their places and power.</p>
<p><strong>महेन्द्रभवनं साक्षादध्युवासाखिलर्द्धिमत्॥</strong></p>
<p>He occupied the very abode of Indra, possessed of every kind of prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>तस्योग्रदण्डसंविग्नास्सर्वे लोकास्सपालकाः।<br>
अन्यत्रालब्धशरणाश्शरणं ययुरच्युतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Frightened at his tyranny, all the worlds with their guardians (the gods), failing to get refuge elsewhere, went to the imperishable Lord Hari, for refuge.</p>
<p><strong>तेषामाविरभूद्वाणी अरूपा मेघनिस्स्वना।<br>

<p>An incorporeal voice like the rumbling of the clouds manifested itself to them: “Great gods! fear not; let there be</p>
<p>welfare to you all. I have known the wickedness of this Hiranyakasipu. the worst of demons. I will put an end to him, but wait for a time.</p>
<p><strong>‘यदा देवेषु वेदेषु गोषु विप्रेषु साधुषु।<br>
धर्मे मयि च विद्वेषः स वा आशु विनश्यति॥</strong></p>
<p>“When one hates gods, Vedas, cows, Brahmins, good men, Dharma and Myself,<br>
he perishes soon.”</p>
<p><strong>‘निर्वैराय प्रशान्ताय स्वसुताय महात्मने।<br>
प्रह्लादाय यदा द्रुह्येद्धनिष्येऽपि वरोर्जितम्॥’</strong></p>
<p>“When however he turns inimical towards his own son Prahlada, a great soul, devoid of any feeling of enmity and completely tranquil, I will kill him, though he is strong with boons.”</p>
<p><strong>दिवौकसो गतोद्वेगा मेनिरे चासुरं हतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>The gods became rid of their mental distress and took the demon as killed.</p>
<p><strong>तस्य दैत्यपतेः पुत्राश्चत्वारः परमाद्भुताः।<br>
प्रहलादोऽभून्महांस्तेषां गुणैर्महदुपासकः॥</strong></p>
<p>The demon-king, Hiranyakasipu, had four marvellous sons; by (his) virtues, Prahlada, a worshipper of the great, was the greatest of them.</p>
<p><strong>ब्रह्मण्यः शीलसंपन्नस्सत्यसन्धो जितेन्द्रियः।<br>

<strong>विद्यार्थरूपजन्माढ्योमानस्तंभविवर्जितः॥</strong></p>
<p>Prahlada wasbeneficent to Brahmins, endowed with character, vowed to truthfulness, and one who had conquered his senses; like the soul, he was the one most beloved friend of all beings; at the feet of the noble, he was prostrate like a servant; and towards the suffering, he was affectionate like a father; he was attached like a brother towards his equals and had the regard of God for his elders; (though) endowed with birth, beauty, wealth and learning, he was devoid of the stiffness of pride.</p>
<p><strong>नोद्विग्नचित्तो व्यसनेषु निस्पृहः<br>

<p>His mind was unalarmed in calamities; he had no craving for the pleasures of this world or of the other heard of in sacrificial scripture, having found them unreal; with senses, breath, body and mind always under control, and with Desire completely extinct, Prahlada, though a demon by birth, was free from the demoniac nature.</p>
<p><strong>गुणैरलमसंख्येयैर्माहात्म्यं तस्य सूच्यते।<br>
वासुदेवे भगवति यस्य नैसर्गिकी रतिः॥</strong></p>
<p>Enough with innumerable virtues; sufficiently indicated is the greatness of one who delights in Lord Vasudeva by his very nature.</p>
<p><strong>तस्मिन्महाभागवते महाभागे महात्मनि।<br>
हिरण्यकशिपू [राजन्] अकरोद्धमात्मज॥</strong></p>
<p>Against that great devotee of the Lord, the blessed and great Prahlada, his own son, Hiranyakasipu sinned (by hating him).</p>
<p><strong>एकदाऽसुरराट् पुत्रमङ्कमारोप्य [पाण्डव]।<br>
पप्रच्छ कथ्यतां वत्स मन्यते साधु यद्भवान्॥</strong></p>
<p>Once, the demon-king took his son (Prahlada) on his lap, and asked him: “Tell me, child, that which you consider good.”</p>
<p>** प्रह्लादः—**</p>
<p><strong>‘तत्साधु मन्येऽसुरवर्य देहिनां<br>

<p>** Prahlada—**</p>
<p>“O eminent demon! That I consider good for men who are ever alarmed in mind in their false notion of I and Mine, namely, that man should abandon the house, the well hidden for his fall, and having gone to the forests, should seek Hari.”</p>
<p><strong>श्रुत्वा पुत्रगिरोदैत्यः परपक्षसमाहिताः।<br>

<p><strong>सम्यग्विधार्यतां बालो गुरुगेहेद्विजातिभिः।<br>

<p>Having heard his son&rsquo;s words in praise of his enemy, the demon laughed: “The minds of boys are liable to be changed by those of others. Let the boy be well watched over by Brahmins in our preceptor&rsquo;s residence so that his mind is not changed by the adherents of Vishnu, who move concealed.”</p>
<p><strong>गृहमानीतमाहूय प्रह्लादं दैत्ययाजकाः।<br>
प्रशस्य श्लक्ष्णया वाचा समपृच्छन्त सामभिः॥</strong></p>
<p>The priests of the demon called forth Prahlada, who had been brought to their<br>
residence, extolled him in fine words and asked of him in conciliatory terms:</p>
<p><strong>‘वत्स प्रह्लाद भद्रं ते सत्यं कथय मा मृषा।<br>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Prahlada, welfare unto you; speak truth and not falsehood: Wherefore</p>
<p>is this affection of your mind which is beyond the range of boys? Is this the work of another or do you have it yoursel?”</p>
<p>** प्रह्लादः—**</p>
<p><strong>‘स्वःपरश्चेत्यसद्ग्राहः पुंसांयन्मायया कृतः<br>

<p>** Prahlada—**</p>
<p>“Obeisance unto that Lord whose Maya it is that causes in men the false notion of ‘one’s own’ and ‘another’, a notion seen (only) in those of deluded minds. As a piece of iron, O Brahmin, moves of itself in the presence of a magnet, even so is my mind affected unaccountably by Lord Hari’s presence.”</p>
<p><strong>तं निर्भर्त्स्याथ कुपितस्स दीनो राजसेवकः।<br>
प्रह्लादं ग्राहयामास त्रिवर्गस्योपपादनम्‌॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, that wretched servant of the king (the Brahmin teacher) became angry, and threatening Prahlada, made him receive his teaching of Dharma, Artha and Kama.</p>
<p><strong>तत एनं गुरुर्ज्ञात्वा ज्ञातज्ञेयचतुष्टयम्।<br>

<p>Finding then that Prahlada had learnt the four subjects (of the kings,-conciliation, bribing, creating dissensions and punishment by war), the preceptor showed him to the demon-king. The demon hailed him with blessings, and embracing him with his arms for long, he said this:</p>
<p><strong>‘प्रह्लादानूच्यतां तात स्वधीतं किञ्चिदुत्तमम्॥</strong></p>
<p>“Prahlada, my child! recite something which you have learnt well, that which is best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>** प्रह्लादः—**</p>
<p><strong>‘श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।<br>

<p><strong>Prahlada—</strong></p>
<p>“Listening to and Singing of the glories of Vishnu, Thinking of Him, Service at His feet, Worshipping Him. Bowing to Him, Becoming a servant of His, Having a friend&rsquo;s love for Him, Offering up of oneself to Him,—if man practises this ninefold devotion to Lord Vishnu, well, that I consider as the greatest learning.”</p>
<p><strong>निशम्यैतत्सुतवचो हिरण्यकशिपुस्तदा।<br>
गुरुपुत्रमुवाचेदं रुषा प्रस्फुरिताधरः॥</strong></p>
<p>Hearing then these words of his son, Hiranyakasipu, with his lip quivering in fury, spoke this to the son of the preceptor:</p>
<p><strong>‘ब्रह्मबन्धो किमेतत्ते विपक्षं श्रयताऽसता।<br>
असारं ग्राहितो बालो मामनादृत्य दुर्मते॥’</strong></p>
<p>“You wretched Brahmin of evil mind! What is this? Ignoring me, you have vilely sided with the enemy and have taught this boy worthless things!”</p>
<p><strong>गुरुपुत्रः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘न मत्प्रणीतं न परप्रणीतं<br>

<p><strong>The teacher&rsquo;s son—</strong></p>
<p>“Enemy of Indra! this that your son speaks, was taught neither by me nor by anybody else. King! this state of mindhathcome to him by nature.Restrainyour ire and do not find fault with us.”</p>
<p><strong>हिरण्यकशिपुः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘न चेद्गुरुमुखीयं ते कुतोऽभद्राऽसती मतिः।’</strong></p>
<p>(Hiranyakasipu asked his son:) “If this your eviland unfortunate attitude of mind is not learnt from your preceptor, wherefrom did you learn it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>प्रह्लादः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘मतिर्न कृष्णे परतस्स्वतो वा<br>

<p><strong>Prahlada—</strong></p>
<p>“For those who are vowed to household life, and with unsubdued senses chew again and again the same cud and (thus) plunge into darkness, the thought of Krishna will be neither from another, nor of themselves, nor mutually.”</p>
<p><strong>इत्युक्त्वोपरतं पुत्रं हिरण्यकशिपूरुषा।<br>
अन्धीकृतात्मा स्वोत्सङ्गान्निरस्यत महीतले॥</strong></p>
<p>In his rage, the blinded Hiranyakasipu flung on the ground from his lap his son who had spoken thus andfinished.</p>
<p><strong>आहामर्षरुषाविष्टः कषायीभूतलोचनः।<br>

पितृव्यहन्तुर्यः पादौ विष्णोर्दासवदर्चति’॥</strong></p>
<p>Possessed by intolerant anger and with eyes turned red, Hiranyakasipu said: “Let this Prahlada be put to death, this Prahlada</p>
<p>who deserves to be killed; demons! take him away. This Vishnu is the person who killed my brother and this base Prahlada, leaving his own friends, does servile worship at the feet of him who killed his own uncle.”</p>
<p><strong>नैर्ऋतास्ते समादिष्टा भर्त्रा वै शूलपाणयः।<br>
तिग्मदंष्ट्रकरालास्याः छिन्धि भिन्धीति वादिनः।<br>

<p>Those demons ordered by their Lord, armed with tridents, their faces terrible with sharp fangs and shouting ‘cut him, tear him’, struck with their tridents Prahlada who was sitting, at all the vital parts of his body.</p>
<p><strong>परे ब्रह्मण्यनिर्देश्ये भगवत्यखिलात्मनि।<br>

<p>(Those tortures) were futile against Prahlada who had riveted his soul on the supreme Brahman, the inscrutable Lord, the soul of all. Fearing (the impossibility of killing him), the lord of the demons sough pertinaciously (several) means of killing him.</p>
<p><strong>दिग्गजैर्दन्दशूकैश्च अभिचारावपातनैः।<br>

<p>With the elephants at the quarters, with serpents, by evil incantations, by throwing him down from heights, by black-magic, burials, poisonings, repeated starving, with cold, storm, fire, water, by rolling boulders on him,—when by all these means the demon could not kill his sinless son, he sank into deep thought but did not find a way of killing him.</p>
<p><strong>‘अप्रमेयानुभावोऽयमकुतश्चिद्भयोऽमरः।<br>
नूनमेतद्विरोधेन मृत्युर्मे भविता नवा॥’</strong></p>
<p>(He said to himself:) “This Prahlada is of inscrutable power; he has fear from nothing; he is indeed immortal; surely by (this) enmity (of mine) with him, there is going to be death for me, a thing new to me.”</p>
<p><strong>वयस्यैरुपहूतोऽथ महाबुध उवाच तान्॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, when friends (in his class) called him, the great man of wisdom, Prahlada,<br>
told them:</p>
<p><strong>‘कौमार आचरेत्प्राज्ञो धर्मान्भागव्रतानिह।<br>
दुर्लभं मानुषं जन्म तदप्यध्रुवमर्थदम्॥</strong></p>
<p>“A wise man should practise here virtues of devotion for the Lord in boyhood (itself), for this birth as man which has to give us our salvation is hard to be attained and, when attained, is impermanent.</p>
<p><strong>‘यथा हि पुरुषस्येह विष्णोः पादोपसर्पणम्।<br>
यदेष सर्वभूतानां प्रिय आत्मेश्वरः सुहृत्॥</strong></p>
<p>“Resorting to the feet of Lord Vishnu is proper for man here; for He is the beloved of all beings, the Soul, the Master and the Friend.</p>
<p><strong>‘सुखमैन्द्रियकं दैत्या देहयोगेन देहिनाम्।<br>

<p>“Demons! as misery comes to men without their effort for it, so also the pleasure of the senses is available for all beings by destiny and by the mere reason of their having taken a body. (Therefore) one should not strain oneself for its sake; for, by doing so, only life ebbs away.</p>

<p>“A hundred years form a man&rsquo;s life; the man who has no self-possession has but<br>
half of that. Twenty years pass away for the fool in his sports of childhood and boyhood and a score (more) pass away as he remains inefficient for any work, his<br>

<p><strong>‘एतावानेव लोकेऽस्मिन्पुंसः स्वार्थः परस्स्मृतः।<br>

<p>Then, all the boys of the demons, having heard what Prahlada had described, imbibed it, since it was irreproachable, and they did not take at all the teaching of their preceptor.</p>
<p><strong>श्रुत्वा तदप्रियं दैत्यः पुत्रं हन्तुं मनो दधे॥</strong></p>
<p>Hearing of that unpleasant thing, the demon (Hiranyakasipu) made up his mind to put an end to his son.</p>
<p><strong>हिरण्यकशिपुः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘हे दुर्विनीत मे मूढ शासनं किंबलोऽत्यगाः॥’</strong></p>
<p>(Hiranyakasipu asked Prahlada:) “You ill-mannered fool, on whose strength did you transgress my bidding?”</p>

<p><strong>Prahlada—</strong></p>
<p>“Not only for me, not only for you, Oking, but for all others also who possess any strength, He is the strength. He is Master, Time and the Lord under whose (three) huge strides are all these worlds. He is the embodiment of energy, might, power, strength and the faculties.</p>

<p>“Leave off this demoniac nature of yours; keep your mind equanimous; (really) there are no foes, no foes except your own unsubdued self, that is on the wrong path. Verily, this is the greatest offering to the eternal Lord.”</p>
<p><strong>हिरण्यकशिपुः—</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hiranyakasipu—</strong></p>
<p>“Clearly you wish to die, you who brag too much. You unlucky (lad)! that other master of the universe besides myself whom you spoke of, where is he? If he<br>

<p>Tormenting his son repeatedly with such bad words, that Hiranyakasipu of exceeding strength struck a pillar with his fist.</p>

<p>Instantaneously there arose from that pillar a very terrific noise, by which the pot of the universe cracked.</p>

<p>To make true the words of his servant (Prahlada) and his own immanence in all things, the Lord manifested Himself in the pillar in the court-hall, taking a very wonderful form, neither animal nor human.</p>

<p>Hiranyakasipu saw all round that Being emerging from the heart of the pillar. “This is not an animal, nor even a man. Alack, what is this in the form of a manlion? Perhaps, the highly deceitful Hari has thought of this as my death. Of what avail is effort against this being?”So saying, that elephant of a demon, shouting and armed with the mace, rushed at the Man-lion.</p>

<p>Lord Hari seized that Hiranyakasipu who was attacking Him with his mace, even as Garuda seizes a python, and throwing him on His thigh at the door, the Lord tore him with ease, licking with His tongue the corners of His opened mouth.</p>

<p>Hearing that the prime-demon, Hiranyakasipu, who had given acutest pain to thethree worlds like some cerebral fever, had been killed in battle by Lord Hari, the celestial damsels again and again poured down showers of flowers, their faces bursting with rapture.</p>

<p>Seeing the lad prostrate at His feet, the Lord, overflowing with compassion, raised him and placed on his head His lotuspalm which affords security to those whose minds are frightened at the serpent of death.</p>
<p><strong>अस्तौषीद्धरिमेकाग्रमनसा सुसमाहितः॥</strong></p>
<p>Prahlada extolled Lord Hari with attention and concentrated mind:</p>

<p>“The low-caste man who has offered up his mind, speech, object of desire, and life to Lord Hari, I consider greater than the Brahmin who possesses the twelve excellen-</p>
<p>ces¹but is averse to the lotus-feet of Lord Hari; the former purifies his (whole) family, not he of stupendous pride.</p>

<p>“Never does this God, Lord of Himself and full with His own gain, go pitiably seeking honour from stupid man; whateverhonour man does to the Lord becomes honour for himself also, even as the beautification of the face is beautification for the face in the reflection.</p>

<p>“Vow of silence, learning, penance, study of scripture, performing one&rsquo;s Dharma, exposition, muttering of prayers in solitude, concentration—these means of salvation often become mere livelihood, O Supreme Being, for persons of unconquered senses; and for those who have these for show, they are not even a livelihood.</p>

<p>There, the leader of an elephant-herd, which lived in the forests of that mountain, was once roving about with female elephants; surrounded by its herd afflicted with thirst, it then ran up tothe neighbourhood of that excellent lake.</p>

<p>It plunged into the lake. and bathing itself and getting rid of fatigue, it drank in plenty its pure and ambrosial water.</p>

<p>There (in the water)a fate-instigated crocodile of great strength furiously caught the elephant-king by the leg. That elephant of exceeding strength, accidentally got into distress thus, exerted to the utmost of its strength (to free itself).</p>

<p><strong>अपारयन्नात्मविमोक्षणे चिरं<br>

<p>The elephant, caught within the lake by the mighty crocodile and distressed, saw in the sky Lord Hari on Garuda, with His discus uplifted; lifting his trunk with a lotus in it, it uttered with great difficulty the words: &ldquo;Narayana, Father of all, Lord, obeisance unto you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot; Cast into the milk-ocean all kinds of medicinal herbs, and with Mount Mandara as the churner, serpent Vasuki as the rope and Myself as aid, O gods, churn diligently. The demons shalltoil, and you shall reap the fruit.</p>

<p>&quot; You should not get frightened at the poison of Kalakuta which will arise from the ocean; you should not exhibit avarice at any time, oranger or love for the things (that will arise from the ocean).&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>इति देवान्समादिश्य भगवान्पुरुषोत्तमः।<br>

<p>Having commanded the gods thus, Lord Hari, the Master moving as He pleases, disappeared from the sight of the gods.</p>
<p><strong>ततो देवासुराः कृत्वा संविदं कृतसौहृदाः।<br>
उद्यमं परमं चक्रुरमृतार्थे [परन्तप ]॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, becoming friends and coming to an understanding, the gods and the demons made the greatest effort for the sake of nectar.</p>
<p><strong>ततस्ते मन्दरगिरिमोजसोत्पाटय दुर्मदाः।<br>
नदन्त उदधिं निन्युः शक्ताः परिघबाहवः॥</strong></p>
<p>Maddened and shouting, the able and bolt-armed gods and demons then tore up with their strength the Mandara Mountain, by the root, and bore it to the milk-ocean.</p>
<p><strong>ते नागराजमामन्त्र्य परिवीय गिरौ मुदा।<br>
आरेभिरे सुसंयत्ता मथितुं तेऽमृतार्थिनः॥</strong></p>
<p>They called in the great serpent Vasuki, tied him round the mountain, and getting ready, began to churn (the ocean) seeking nectar.</p>
<p><strong>मध्यमानेऽर्णवे सोऽद्रिरनाधारो ह्यपोऽविशत्॥</strong></p>
<p>When the ocean was being churned, the Mandara mountain which had no support underneath, went into the waters.</p>
<p><strong>विलोक्य विघ्नेशविधिं तदेश्वरः<br>

<p>Seeing then the work of the god of obstacles, the Lord took the form of a huge and wonderful tortoise, dived into the waters and lifted the mountain. And the gods and the demons rose (again) to churn.</p>

<p>Out of the ocean that was being churned, there arose, in front of them, the very terrible poison named Halahala. Seeing that poison of formidable force sweeping across all quarters, and below, unbearable and irremediable, people, along with the gods, frightened and unprotected (by any), fled to the ever auspicious God Siva for refuge.</p>
<p><strong>तद्वीक्ष्य व्यसनं तासां कृपया भृशपीडितः।<br>
सर्वभूतसुहृदेव इदमाह सतीं प्रियाम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that great calamity of the people, God Siva, the friend of all beings, was painedvery much as a result of of his compassion and He said this to Parvati, His beloved :</p>
<p><strong>‘अहो बत भवान्येतत्प्रजानां पश्य वैशसम्।<br>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! Parvati! behold! this suffering of the people that has come from the Kalakuta poison risen from the churning of the milk-ocean. I must afford security to these who desire to Save their lives. For, this much is the purpose of a Master, namely, the protection of the afflicted. Hence shall I drink this poison; let there be welfare for the people through Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>ततः करतलीकृत्य व्यापि हालाहलं विषम्।<br>
अभक्षयन्महादेवः कृपया भूतभावनः॥</strong></p>
<p>Then, taking the spreading Halahala poison on his palm, the great God Siva, the gratifier of beings, swallowed it, in his compassion.</p>
<p><strong>तस्यापि दर्शयामास स्ववीर्यंजलकल्मषः।<br>
यच्चकार गले नीलं तच्च साधोर्विभूषणम्॥</strong></p>
<p>On God Siva also, that stain of waters,the poison, displayed its powers; for it stained His throat dark ; but to that benefactor, the stain was an ornament.</p>
<p><strong>तप्यन्ते लोकतापेन साधवः प्रायशो जनाः॥</strong></p>
<p>Generally, good men suffer themselves as a result of the suffering of the world.</p>
<p><strong>पीते गरे वृषाङ्केण प्रीतास्तेऽमरदानवाः।<br>
ममन्थुस्तरसा सिन्धुं हविर्धानी ततोऽभवत्॥</strong></p>
<p>When the poison had been drunk by Siva, the gods and the demons were satisfied and theychurned the ocean forcibly; there arose then the cow Kamadhenu.</p>

<p>Then arose the horse named Ucchaisravas, white like the moon; then emerged the great elephant named Airavata ; (then) the ruby named Kaustubha came out of the ocean; then came out the Parijata tree, the ornament of the celestial world; thenwere born the Apsarases with golden necklaces and beautiful garments.</p>
<p><strong>ततश्चाविरभूत्साक्षाच्छ्री रमा भगवत्परा।<br>

<p>And then arose Goddess Lakshmi Herself, bent on attaining the Lord. Everybody desired Her, gods, demons and mortals .</p>
<p><strong>ततः कृतस्वस्त्ययनोत्पलस्रजं<br>

<p><strong>गन्धर्वयक्षासुरसिद्धचारण-<br>

<p>With the benediction (of all), she then took in her hand a garland of lilies humming with bees, and looked round for an irreproachable person proper for Her, one of permanent and invariably existent virtues, but did not get one such among the Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras, Siddhas, Charanas, other denizens of heaven and the like.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;नूनं तपो यस्य न मन्युनिर्जयो</strong><br>
<strong>ज्ञानं क्वचित्तच्च न सङ्गवर्जितम्।</strong><br>
<strong>कश्चिन्महांस्तस्य न कामनिर्जयः<br>

<p>“ He who certainly possessed (the merit of) penance had not conquered wrath; there was knowledge somewhere but it was not free from attachment to material objects; there was some one great but he had not overcome passion; is he a lord who is dependent on another?</p>
<p><strong>‘धर्मः क्वचित्तत्र न भूतसौहृदं<br>

<p>“ There is Dharma in a place, but no friendliness to beings; sacrifice there is in some one, but not as means for selfdeliverance. Somewhere, there is long life, but the auspiciousness of character is absent. (Alas !) that some one who is perfectly auspicious does not desire me.”</p>
<p><strong>एवं विमृश्याव्यभिचारिसद्गुणैः।<br>
वव्रे मुकुन्दं निरपेक्षमीप्सितम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Thus discriminating, Lakshmi chose Hari as Her desired Lord, because of his excellences being invariably existent, though He Himself was indifferent.</p>

<p>She placed on His shoulders that beautiful garland of fresh lilies, resonant with the hum of the cluster of drunken bees, and stood by His side; the Lord, the Father, made His own chest the best abode of the Mother, the Goddess of all prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>अथासीद्वारुणी देवी कन्या कमललोचना।<br>
असुरा जगृहुस्तां वै हरेरनुमतेन ते॥</strong></p>
<p>Then there arose the young goddess of wine, with eyes like the red-lotus; with the permission of Lord Hari, the took her.</p>
<p><strong>अथोदतिष्ठत्पुरुषः सुभगः सिंहविक्रमः।<br>

धन्वन्तरिरिति ख्यात आयुर्वेददृगिज्यभाक्॥</strong></p>
<p>Then arose a beautiful person, adorned with armlets armlets and of lion-like strides, bearing a jar filled with nectar. He wasa partial incarnation of Lord Hati Himself, known as Dhanvantari, the founder of the science of medicine and one who had a share in sacrificial offerings.</p>
<p><strong>तमालोक्यासुरास्सर्वे कलशं तरसाऽहरन्।<br>

<p>Seeing Dhanvantari, all the Asuras snatched the jar (of nectar) forcibly. When the jar of nectar was being carried away by the demons, the depressed gods went to Hari for refuge.</p>
<p><strong>‘मा खिद्यत मिथोऽर्थंवः साधयिष्ये स्वमायया।&rsquo;<br>
इत्युक्त्वा सान्त्वयन्देवांस्तत्रैवान्तर्दधे हरिः॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Feel not miserable; secretly and through my Maya, I shall accomplish your object.&rdquo; Having said so, Hari consoled the gods and disappeared at that very place.</p>
<p><strong>मिथः कलिरभूत्तेषां तदर्थे तर्षचेतसाम्॥</strong></p>
<p>There was mutual quarrel among the demons who were covetous of the nectar.</p>
<p><strong>एतस्मिन्नन्तरे विष्णुस्सर्वोपायविदीश्वरः।<br>

<p>In the meanwhile, Lord Vishnu, who knew all expedients, took an indescribable and most wonderful female form. With bashful smiles and glances cast with theplay of the brows, He (She) frequently kindled
passion in the minds of the demon-chiefs.</p>
<p><strong>दैत्याः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘का त्वं कञ्जपलाशाक्षि कुतो वा किं चिकीर्षसि।<br>

<p>The Demons—</p>
<p>“ Who are you,damsel of eyes like lotus-petals ? Where have you come from ? What do you desire to do? You lady of fine waist ! You find a way of settlement for us who are (thus) contending (mutually); justly divide (this nectar)so that there may be no quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>ततो गृहीत्वाऽमृतभाजनं हरि–<br>

<p>Then, taking the nectar-vessel, Lord Hari spoke in words beautified with gentle smile: &ldquo;Good or bad, if you would accept whatever I do, I shall divide this nectar amongst you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>इत्यभिव्याहृतं तस्यास्तत्तथेत्यन्वमंसत॥</strong></p>
<p>(The demons) approved of what She spoke, saying: &ldquo;Let it be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the gods and the demons had sat facing the east, the Lord of the universe made two separate rows for the two; and with the nectar-vessel in his hand, He deceived the demons, merely approaching them often (with sweet gestures and words), and made (the gods), sitting at a distance, drink that nectar which destroyed old age and death.</p>
<p><strong>ते पालयन्तस्समयमसुराः स्वकृतं [नृप]।<br>

<p>Abiding by the understanding they themselves came to (with Her), the demons who had great love for Her, were afraid of any danger to that love and were tied down by their regard for Her, did not speak anything unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>एवं सुरासुरगणाः समदेशकाल–<br>

<p>Thus, though the gods and the demons were alike in respect of place, time, purpose, means, endeavour and intelligence, they differed in the reaping of fruit. Between the two, the gods easily got the fruit, because of their seeking the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord, and (by not doing that) the demons failed to get it.</p>
<p><strong>साधयित्वाऽमृतं [राजन् ] पाययित्वा स्वकान्सुरान्।<br>

<p>Having brought into being ambrosia and having made His own adherents, the gods, drink it, the Lord disappeared even as all beings were looking on.</p>

<p>With his lordship subdued (by Indra), Bali (the king of the demons) sought the Bhrigus, (his preceptors). The Brahmins, the Bhrigus, anointed with affection and in the prescribed manner Bali who desired to conquer heaven and performed for him the (world-conquering) Visvajit sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>हुताशनादास हविर्भिरिष्टाद्<br>

<p>Mounting a celestial chariot then and dragging an army after him, king Bali went against the highly prosperous city of Indra, built by Visvakarman,to which the unrighteous and the wicked, enemies of beings, knaves, haughty persons, men of passion and greed go not, but to which those free from these sins go.</p>
<p><strong>तां देवधानीं स वरूथिनीपतिः<br>

<p>Bali, the head of the army, laid siege to that capital of the gods with his army.</p>

सर्वदेवगणोपेतो गुरुमेतदुवाच ह॥</strong></p>
<p>Seeing that great effort of Bali, Indra, along with all the gods, said this to his preceptor (Brihaspati):</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;भगवन्नुद्यमो भूयान् बलेर्नः पूर्ववैरिणः।<br>

<p><strong>हित्वा त्रिविष्टपं जग्मुर्गीर्वाणाः कामरूपिणः॥</strong></p>
<p>The gods who could take any form they desired, left the heaven and went away.</p>

<p>When her sons had thus disappeared and hewen had been captured by the demons, Aditi, the mother of the gods, suffered like a helpless person.</p>

<p>Aditi—</p>
<p>&quot; My lord! save us who have been deprived of our prosperity and position by cur foes, O you who are capable and are the greatest of benefactors! With your intellect, do us such benefaction as will make my sons regain that prosperity and position.&quot;</p>

<p>__________________________________________</p>
<p>* Payovrata is to be observed for twelve days in the bright fortnight, of the Phalguna month. God Hari should be worshipped continuously, the devotee sustaining himself on milk alone.</p>

<p>&quot; Divine lady! my opinion is that, at the present moment, those demon-chiefs are almost invincible. Still, I who have been propitiated by your observance should</p>
<p>think of a plan. Partially manifesting Myself as your son, and taking my stand on the penance of Kasyapa, I shall save your sons.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>एतावदुक्ता भगवांस्तत्रैवान्तरधीयत॥</strong></p>
<p>Having told this much, the Lord disappeared at that very place.</p>

<p>The Immortal Being, the Lord of tawny garment and eyes broad like the lotus, manifested Himself in Aditi&rsquo;s womb. With that form itself which shines with ornaments and weapons, He transformed Himself into a dwarf-Brahmacharin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brahmin lad! take from me whatever you desire; I infer that you are seeking something; land, gold, a clean and excellent house, food and drink, or a maiden, (take whatever you desire).&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘न ह्येतस्मिन्कुले कश्चिन्निस्सत्त्वः कृपणः पुमान्।<br>
प्रत्याख्याता प्रतिश्रत्य यो वाऽदाता द्विजातये॥</strong></p>
<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&quot; There is none in this line (of yours) who has been untruthful or niggardly, none who had promised and gone back on his word, and none who had not been munificent to a Brahmin.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;पिता प्रहलादपुत्रस्ते तद्विद्वान्द्विजवत्सलः।<br>
स्वमायुर्द्विजलिङ्गेभ्यो देवेभ्योऽदात्स याचितः॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Your father, (Virochana), that son of Prahlada, attached to the Brahmins, being begged by the gods in the guise of Brahmins, gave them his life, knowing their identity.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;तस्मात्त्वत्तो महीमीषद्वृणेऽहं वरदर्षभात्।<br>
पदानि त्रीणि दैत्येन्द्र संमितानि पदा मम॥</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, O king of demons, I ask of you, the greatest of the munificent, a little bit of land, three feet measured by my feet.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;नान्यत्ते कामये राजन् वदान्याज्जगदीश्वरात्।<br>

<p>&ldquo;King! I desire nothing else from you, a munificent donor and the lord of the</p>
<p>universe. A wise person who receives only as much as is necessary does not incur any sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>बलिः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘अहो ब्राह्मणदायाद वाचस्तेऽवृद्धसंमताः।<br>
पदत्रयं वृणीते योऽबुद्धिमान् द्वीपदाशुषम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Bali—</p>
<p>&quot; Alas, you Brahmin, uncommendable by the elders are your words, an unwise person who asks three feet (of ground) of him who would give away a continent.</p>
<p><strong>‘न पुमान्मामुपव्रज्य भूयो याचितुमर्हति।<br>
तस्माद्वृत्तिकरीं भूमिं वटो कामं प्रतीच्छ मे॥’</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Having come to me, a person should not beg a second time. Therefore, O Brahmin lad ! do take from me land enough to maintain you.</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यावन्तो विषयाः प्रेष्ठास्त्रिलोक्यामजितेन्द्रियम्।<br>

<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&quot; King, not all the things that are dearest in these worlds car fully satisfy one of uncontrolled senses.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;त्रिभिः क्रमैरसन्तुष्टो द्वीपेनापि न पूर्यते॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; One not satisfied with three feet, will not be satisfied with even a continent.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;सप्तद्वीपाधिपतयो नृपा वैन्यगयादयः।<br>
अर्थैः कामैर्गता नान्तं तृष्णाया इति नः श्रुतम्॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; We have heard that kings like Vainya and Gaya did not reach the end of their avarice for material possessions and pleasures, though they were lords of (all) the seven continents.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;पुंसोऽयं संसृतेर्हेतुरसन्तोषोऽर्थकामयोः।<br>
यदृच्छयोपपन्नेन सन्तोषो मुक्तये स्मृतः॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; This Non-Contentment in Possession and Desire is the cause of man&rsquo;s migration through births and deaths; contentment with what turns up casually makes for deliverance.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यदृच्छालाभतुष्टस्य तेजो विप्रस्य वर्धते।<br>
तत्प्रशाम्यत्यसन्तोषादम्भसेवाशुशुक्षणिः॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; The spiritual power of the Brahmin who is content with what is got by chance increases; that power dies out by non-contentment, like fire by water.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;तस्मात्त्रीणि पदान्येव वृणे त्वद्वरदर्षभात्।<br>
एतावतैव सिद्धोऽहं वित्तं यावत्प्रयोजनम्॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Hence, I ask of you only three feet, though you are the greatest of the bounteous; even with this much shall I have achieved my purpose. Only so much as is useful is wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>इत्युक्तस्स हसन्नाह वाच्छातः प्रतिगृह्यताम्।<br>
वामनाय महीं दातुं जग्राहजलभाजनम्॥</strong></p>
<p>So told, Bali said with a smile: &ldquo;Have it as you please.&rdquo; And he took the water- vessel to make the gift of land to Vamana.</p>
<p><strong>विष्णवे क्ष्मां प्रदास्यन्तमुशना असुरेश्वरम्।<br>
जानंश्चिकीर्षितं विष्णोः शिष्यं प्राह विदां वरः॥</strong></p>
<p>Knowing what Vishnu desired to do, Sukra, the most eminent of the wise, told his pupil, the king of the Asuras, who was about to make the gift of land to Vishnu:</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;एष वैरोचने विष्णुर्देवानां कार्यसाधकः।<br>

एष ते स्थानमैश्वर्यंश्रियं तेजो यशः श्रुतम्।<br>
दासत्याच्छिद्य शक्राय मायामाणवको हरिः॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>“ Bali, this is Vishnu, (come here) to achieve the purpose of the gods. I do not approve of the (gift) you have promised Him without knowing the danger. A great calamity hath happened to thedemons. This Hari in the guise of a Brahmacharinis going to snatch your place, lordship, prosperity, power, fame and learning and give them to Indra.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>बलिः—</strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>स चाहं वित्तलोभेन प्रत्याचक्षे कथं द्विजम्।<br>
प्रतिश्रुत्य ददामीति प्राह्लादिः कितवो यथा॥</strong></p>
<p>Bali—</p>
<p>&quot; How shall I, a descendant of Prahlada, like some cheat, refuse (the gift) to a Brahmin after having promised to give him?</p>
<p>&lsquo;<strong>सर्वंसोढुमलं मन्ये ऋतेऽलीकपरं नरम्।<br>
नाहं बिभेमि निरयाद्यथ विप्रप्रलभनात्॥&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>&quot; I consider everything bearable except the man of faleshoods. I do not fear hell so much as deceiving a Brahmin.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>एवं सत्यान्न चलितो वामनाय ददौ मुदा॥</strong></p>
<p>Not swerving from truthfulness in this manner, Bali gladly made the gift to Vamana.</p>
<p><strong>तद्वामनं रूपमवर्धताद्भुतं<br>
काये बलिस्तस्य ददर्श विश्वम्।<br>
भूतेन्द्रियार्थाशयजीवयुक्तं<br>
रराज [राजन्] भगवानुरुक्रमः॥</strong></p>
<p>That dwarf-form grew wonderfully. In that body of the Lord, Bali saw the beings, their senses, minds (whole) universe with its faculties, the objects of the and individual souls. The Lord of huge strides shone.</p>
<p><strong>क्षितिं पदैकेन बलेर्विचक्रमे<br>
नभः शरीरेण दिशश्च बाहुभिः।<br>
पदं द्वितीयं क्रमतस्त्रिविष्टपं<br>

<p>The Lord bestrode the (whole of) Dali&rsquo;s earth with one foot and (pervaded) the skies with His body, and the quarters with His arms; and for Him who bestrode the heaven with the second foot, there was not even an atom belonging to Bali for His third.</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>

<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&quot; Demon, three feet of ground were gifted by you to me; with two feet, I have covered the entire universe. Find me the space for the third foot. Promising to give, you, who imagined yourself wealthy, have deceived Me. Therefore, enjoy for a few years the fruit of this fraud,— hell.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>बलिः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यद्युत्तमश्लोक भवान्मयेरितं<br>

<p>Bali—</p>
<p>&quot; O you foremost of gods, O you of highest renown! if you consider the words I had spoken as deceitful, I will make them true; there shall be no fraud, place your third foot on my head.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;बिभेमि नाहं निरयाहुरत्ययात्<br>
असाधुवादाद्भृशमुद्विजे यक्षा॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; I am not afraid so much of interminable hell as I shudder terribly at infamy.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;पुंसां श्लाघ्यतमं मन्ये दण्डमर्हत्तमार्पितम्॥</strong></p>
<p>&quot; Punishment at the hands of the greatest of the revered is, I think, most praiseworthy for men.</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;यस्मिन्वैरानुबन्धेन रूढेन विबुधेतराः।<br>

<p>&quot; I have been overpowered by Him through deep and persistent enmity with whom many demons attained the salvation that the Yogins devoted to Him alone attain. (Hence) I am neither ashamed notpained.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>तस्येत्थंभाषमाणस्य प्रह्लादो भगवत्प्रियः।<br>
आजगाम [कुरुश्रेष्ठ] राकापतिरिवोत्थितः॥</strong></p>
<p>As Bali was speaking in this manner, Prahlada the beloved of the Lord came there, looking like the full moon risen.</p>
<p><strong>तमिन्द्रसेनः स्वपितामहं बलिः<br>
ननाम मूर्ध्नाऽश्रुविलोललोचनः॥</strong></p>
<p>Bali, with eyes trembling with tears, bowed with his head to his grandfather (Prahlada).</p>
<p><strong>प्रह्लादः—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;त्वयैव दत्तं पदमैन्द्रमूर्जितं<br>

<p>(Prahlada addressed The Lord): “The prosperous place of Indra was given by Yourself; and now, it has been taken back by Yourself. The latter is as welldone (as the former). I think that a great blessing has been bestowed on Bali since he has been thrown down from the pelf that deludes one.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>श्रीभगवान्—</strong></p>
<p><strong>&rsquo;[ब्रह्मन्] यमनुगृह्णामि तद्विशो विधुनोम्यहम्।<br>

<p>The Lord—</p>
<p>&quot; I destroy the possessions of him whom I bless, possessions infatuated with which man becomes haughty and insults the world and Myself also.</p>
<p><strong>‘एष दानवदैत्यानामग्रणीः कीर्तिवर्धनः।<br>

<p>&quot; This renowned Bali, foremost of the demons, has conquered the invincible Illusion.</p>
<p>Praiseworthy in his vow, he forsook not Truth. He is being sent by me to a place of Mine hard of access even to the gods.</p>

<p>&quot; O great king Bali! let there be welfare unto you; surrounded by your relations, go to the Sutala region, prayed for by the denizens of heaven. I shall protect you from everything. You shall be seeing Me for all time.</p>

<p>Desiring to protect Cows, Brahmins, gods, good men, the Vedas, Dharma, and Artha also, the Lord assumes bodily forms.</p>
<p><strong>आसीदतीतकल्पान्ते ब्राह्मो नैमित्तिको लयः।<br>

<p>At the end of the last aeon, there was an involution caused by Brahma going to sleep. In that involution, the Earth and other worlds became deluged by the oceans.</p>
<p><strong>कालेनागतनिद्रस्य धातुश्शिशयिषोर्बली।<br>

<p>The powerful Hayagriva (a demon), who was near, carried away the Vedas that had emanated from the face of the creator who desired to close his eyes in the sleep that came upon him on account of the aeon-end.</p>
<p><strong>ज्ञात्वा तहानवेन्द्रस्य हयग्रीवस्य चेष्टितम्।<br>

<p>Learning of that act of the demon-chief Hayagriva, Lord Hari assumed the form of a Fish.</p>
<p><strong>तत्र राजऋषिः कश्चिन्नाम्नासत्यव्रतो महान्।<br>
नारायणपरोऽतप्यत्तपः स सलिलाशनः॥</strong></p>
<p>At that time, a great royal sage, Satyavrata by name, was performing penance, absolutely devoted to Narayana, sustaining himself on water alone.</p>
<p><strong>एकदा कृतमालायां कुर्बतो जलतर्पणम्।<br>
तस्याञ्जल्युदके काचिच्छफर्येकाऽभ्यपद्यत॥</strong></p>
<p>Once, as he was offering water-libation in the Kritamala river, there came a tiny fish with the water into his hard.</p>

<p>The compassionate Satyavrata placed it in the water in his pitcher and took it to his hermitage. In a night, it grew in size in that pitcher. Satyavrata took it out of the pitcher and placed it in the water in atub. Placed there, it grew to three arms&rsquo; length in a moment. It was taken out of it and thrown into a big lake by the king. That great fish pervaded the lake with its body and was (still) growing continuously. The king (then) threw into the ocean that fish which was filling every kind of reservoir of water.</p>
<p><strong>तमाह को भवानस्मान् मत्स्यरूपेण मोहयन्॥</strong></p>

<p>When the righteous Rama who brought happiness to all beings was king, there did not exist mental and physical maladies, old-age, fatigue, misery, sorrow, fear and</p>
<p>weariness. Upholding the vow of devotion to one wife, living the life of a royal sage, and remaining pure, Rama Himself observed His His Dharma as a householder, (thereby) teaching it (to the world).</p>
<p><strong>स्मरतां हृदि विन्यस्य विद्धं दण्डककण्टकैः।<br>

<p>Imprinting in the hearts of those who remembered Him, His sprout—like feet, pricked by the thorns of the Dandaka forests, Rama went away from Ayodhya to His own effulgent abode.</p>

<p>This, the annihilation of the demons and the damming of the ocean with (the power of) His arrows, is hardly any glory for that king of the Raghus, who assumed in sport that form at the entreaty of the</p>

<p>Jamadagni married Renuka, the daughter of Renu. Of her and that sage of the Bhrigu line (Jamadagni), was born the very well known Rama, who, they say, was a partial incarnation of Lord Vasudeva, the annihilator of the race of the Haihayas, He who, twenty-one times, swept this earth clean of the Kshatriyas.</p>

<p>There was the greatest of the Kshatriyas, Arjuna (Kartavirya), the king of the Haihayas, who obtained a thousand arms and inviolability by foes. Sporting (in the waters) with his excellent women, he dammed the river with his arms: and the ten-headed Ravana, he imprisoned and released as one would a monkey.</p>

<p>Once he came into the hermitage of Jamadagni. The sage for whom penance was his wealth, offered hospitality to that king with all his army, ministers and animals, with the aid of his Kamadhenu.</p>

<p>The valorous Arjuna saw in that hermitage of Jamadagni that excelling of his own wealth. In his pride, he set his men to carry away Kamadhenu ; and they forcibly took to Mahishmati (Arjuna&rsquo;s capital) that bleating cow with its calf.</p>

<p>Then, when the king had gone, Rama, who had returned, heard in the hermitage of that wickedness of Arjuna and became furious like a beaten serpent. Seizing his terrible axe, quiver, shield and bow, the inviolable Rama ran after Arjuna, like a lion running after an elephant.</p>

<p>When their father was killed, Arjuna&rsquo;s sons, numbering ten thousand, fled in fear. Rama, the destroyer of enemy—warriors, recovered the cow along with her calf, reached the hermitage and gave the muchharassed cow to his father. Rama described his exploit, (whereon) Jamadagni (his father)said :</p>
<p><strong>&lsquo;राम राम महाबाहो भवान्पापमकारषीत्।<br>

<p>Remembering the killing of their father, the sons of Arjuna, getting an opportunity when Rama, along with his brothers, had once gone away from the hermitage into the forests, came ( to the hermitage) desiring to wreak vengeance. They saw the sage (Jamadagni) in the fire—chamber, sitting in meditation. Though entreated by the pitiable mother of Rama, those extremely cruel and base Kshatriyas forcibly chopped and carried off Jamadagni&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p><strong>रेणुका राम रामेति विचुक्रोशोच्चकैस्सती।<br>

<p><strong>प्रगृह्य परशुं रामः क्षत्रान्ताय मनो दधे॥</strong></p>
<p>Seizing his hatchet, Rama made up his mind to annihilate the Kshatriyas.</p>

<p>Going to Mahishmati, whose prosperity had already been destroyed by those murderers of the Brahmin, Rama raised a great mountain in the centre of the city, with the heads of those (sons of Arjuna), and with their blood, He created a terrible river, striking terror in the enemies of the Brahmins.</p>

<p>The cowherd-boys who were sitting round Krishna in many circular rows, with dilated eyes, and facing Him, shone in the forest (there), like the petals round the pericarp of a lotus.</p>

<p>Thus did Brahma see for once all those beings as one with the Supreme Spirit, by<br>
the light of which, all this, the universe with all (things) moving and static, shines.</p>

<p>There was a friend of Krishna, a Brahmin, foremost of those who have realised the Brahman, unattracted to objects of pleasure, of tranquil mind and subdued senses, a householder who was living by what came unsought.</p>
<p><strong>तस्य भार्या कुचेलस्य क्षुत्क्षामा च तथाविधा।<br>
पतिव्रता पतिं प्राह म्लायता वदनेन सा॥</strong></p>
<p>The devoted wife of that Kuchela, who was emaciated with hunger, but was of the same nature (as her husband), told her husband with a withered face:</p>
<p><strong>‘ननु ब्रह्मन् भगवतः सखा साक्षाच्छ्रियः पतिः।<br>
तमुपैहि महाभाग साधूनां च परायणम्।<br>
दास्यति द्रविणं भूरि सीदते ते कुटुम्बिने॥</strong></p>
<p>“O Brahmin ! is not the Lord of the Goddess of Fortune Himself a friend of your adored self ? O self ? O you who are blessed ! approach Him, the refuge of the good. He will give ample wealth to you who are perishing with a large family.”</p>
<p><strong>स एवं भार्यया विप्रो बहुशः प्रार्थितो मृदुः ।<br>
‘अयं हि परमो लाभ उत्तमश्लोकदर्शनम्’।<br>
इति सञ्चिन्त्य मनसा गमनाय मतिं दधे ॥</strong></p>
<p>Thus entreated many times, softly, by his wife, the Brahmin thought: “This indeed is the greatest gain, the seeing of the Lord of purest fame.” And he decided to go (to the Lord).</p>
<p><strong>याचित्वा चतुरो मुष्टीन् विप्रान् पृथुकतण्डुलान्।<br>
चेलखण्डेन बद्ध्वा स प्रययौ द्वारकां किल।<br>
कृष्णसन्दर्शने मह्यं कथं स्यादिति चिन्तयन्॥</strong></p>
<p>Begging of (the neighbouring) Brahmins four handfuls of Prithuka (fried and Rattened rice), and tying them in a piece of cloth, Kuchela proceeded to Dwaraka,thinking: “How can I have the sight of Krishna !”</p>
<p><strong>गृहं विवेशैकतमं ब्रह्मानन्दं गतो यथा॥</strong></p>
<p>Kuchela entered one of the mansions of Krishna feeling like one who had attained beatitude.</p>
<p><strong>तं विलोक्याच्युतोऽभ्येत्य दोर्भ्यां पर्यग्रहीन्मुदा।<br>
अथोपवेश्य पर्यङ्के स्वयं सब्युस्समर्हणम्।<br>
उपहृत्यावनिज्यास्य पादौ स्वागतमब्रवीत्॥</strong></p>
<p>The imperishable Lord saw Kuchela, approached and embraced him with joy. Seating him then on a cot, the Lord Himself fetched things for the worship of the friend, washed his feet and spoke words of welcome.</p>
<p><strong>कुचेलं मलिनं क्षामं द्विजं धमनिसन्ततम्।<br>
देवी पर्यचरद्भेष्मी चामरव्यजनेन वै॥</strong></p>
<p>Queen Rukmini attended with the chowrie upon that untidy, emaciated Brahmin, Kuchela, who had a body only of veins and nerves.</p>
<p><strong>कथयाञ्चक्रतुर्गाथाः पूर्वा गुरुकुले सतोः।<br>
आत्मनोर्ललिता [ राजन् ] करौ गृह्य परस्परम्॥</strong></p>
<p>Clasping each other’s hands, Krishna and Kuchela talked their own beautiful old stories (of the days ) when they were in the teacher’s house together.</p>
<p>** श्रीभगवान्—**</p>
<p><strong>‘प्रायां गृहेषु ते चित्तमकामविहतं तथा।<br>
नैवातिप्रीयसे विद्वन् धनेषु विदितं हि मे॥</strong></p>
<p>** The Lord—**</p>
<p>“In household life, life, your mind is not lost in material desires. O man of wisdom ! I know you are not over-fond of riches.</p>
<p><strong>‘किमुपायनमानीतं ब्रह्मन् मे भवता गृहात्।<br>
अण्वप्युपाहृतं भक्तैः प्रेम्णा भूर्येव मे भवेत्।<br>
भूर्यप्यभक्तोपहृतं न मे तांषाय कल्पते॥</strong></p>
<p>“O Brahmin ! What offering have you brought for me from your house ? Even the little that is offered by the devoted will become ample because of the love; and even the ample that is offered by the unloving does not suffice to satisfy Me.</p>
<p><strong>‘पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्तथा प्रयच्छति।<br>
तदहं भक्त पहृतमश्नामि प्रयतात्मनः॥’</strong></p>
<p>“A leaf, a flower, a fruit, or some water,—if one gives me any of these in devotion, I enjoy that offering of devotion from one of pure soul.”</p>
<p><strong>इत्युक्तोऽपि द्विजस्तस्मै ब्रीडितः पतये श्रियः।<br>
पृथुकप्रसृतिं [ राजन् ] न प्रायच्छदवाङ्मुखः॥</strong></p>
<p>Though he was told in this manner, the Brahmin, ashamed and with a down-cast face, did not give the handful of Prithuka to Krishna who was the Lord of the goddess of wealth.</p>
<p><strong>सर्वभूतात्मदृक् साक्षात्तस्यागमनकारणम्।<br>
विज्ञायाचिन्तयन्नायं श्रीकामो मा भजत्पुरा॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>पत्न्याः पतिव्रतायास्तु सखा प्रियचिकीर्षया।<br>
प्राप्तो मामस्य दास्यामि सम्पदोऽमर्त्यदर्लभाः॥</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the cause of Kuchela’s visit, the Lord, who is the witness of the souls of all beings, thought: “This Kuchela never worshipped me in the past, desiring wealth. It is to please his devoted wife that my friend has come now; I will give him riches hard to be cbtained even by the gods.”</p>
<p><strong>इत्थं विचिन्त्य वसनात् चीरबद्धान् द्विजन्मनः।<br>
स्वयं जहार किमिदमिति पृथुकतण्डुलान्॥</strong></p>
<p>Thinking thus, the Lord Himself snatched from the Brahmin’s garment the Prithuka tied in a rag, asking him: “What is this?”</p>
<p><strong>‘नन्वेतदुपनीतं मे परमप्रीणनं सखे।<br>
तर्पयन्त्यङ्ग मां विश्वमेते पृथुकतण्डुलाः॥’</strong></p>
<p>“Friend, you have brought me this, which pleases me most. These grains of Prithuka will indeed satisfy me who am of the form of the Universe.”</p>
<p><strong>इति मुष्टिं सहज्जग्ध्वा द्वितीयां जग्धुमाददे।<br>
तावच्छ्रीर्जगृहे हस्तं सत्वरा परमेष्ठिनः।<br>
‘एतावताऽलं विश्वात्मन् सर्वसम्पत्समृद्धये’॥</strong></p>
<p>Saying this, the Lord ate one handful, and took a second handful to eat. Ere He ate, goddessLakshmi (Rukmini) caught in haste the hand of the lord saying: “This (one handful) suffices, O Lord who is of the form of the universe ! to fill one with all the riches.”</p>
<p><strong>ब्राह्मणस्तां तु रजनीमुषित्वाऽच्युतमन्दिरे।<br>
श्वोभूते विश्वभावेन स्वसखेनाभिवन्दितः।<br>
जगाम स्वालयं [ तात ] पथ्यनुव्रज्य नन्दितः॥</strong></p>
<p>The Brahmin lived that night in the mansion of the imperishable Lord and the next morning, saluted by the Lord, the bestower of prosperity to the universe, and accompanied by Him for some distance, went home, pleased.</p>
<p><strong>स चालब्ध्वा धनं कृष्णान्न तु याचितवान् स्वयम्।<br>
स्वगृहान् व्रीडितोऽगच्छन्महर्द्दर्शननिर्वृतः॥</strong></p>
<p>Not receiving any riches from Krishna, Kuchela did not ask for them himself. He went home ashamed, but happy at having seen the great Lord.</p>
<p><strong>‘क्वाहं दरिद्रः पापीयान् क्व कृष्णः श्रीनिकेतनः।<br>

<p>“Where am I, a pauper and a sinner and where is Krishna, the abode of the Goddess of Fortune? He embraced me with his arms because I was born a Brahmin. The worship of His feet is the source of all of all attainments. The merciful Lord, I am sure, did not give me ample wealth, thinking that, obtaining wealth, this poor self of mine might get intoxicated and forget Him.” Thus thinking within himself, Kuchela approached the vicinity of his home, which was (now) surrounded on all sides by storied mansions bright like the sun, fire and moon, and wonderful wonderful parks and gardens full of bevies of warbling birds, and inhabited by beautifully decked men and fawn-eyed women.</p>
<p><strong>‘किमिदं कस्य वा स्थानं कथं तदिदमित्यभूत्।’<br>

<p>“What is this ? Whose abode is this ? How did this come to be ?” As he was thus thinking, god-like men and women received that blessed Kuchela with tumultuous music.</p>
<p><strong>पतिमागतमाकर्ण्य पत्न्युद्धर्षाऽतिसम्भ्रमा।<br>
मीलिताक्ष्यनमद्बुद्धधा मनसा परिषस्वजे॥</strong></p>
<p>Hearing that her husband had come, the wife (of Kuchela), with exhilaration and in a flurry, closed her eyes, eyes, bowed to him with her mind, and embraced him with her heart.</p>
<p><strong>प्रीतः स्वयं तया युक्तः प्रविष्टो निजमन्दिरम्।<br>
मणिस्तम्भशवोपेतं महेन्द्रभवनं यथा॥</strong></p>
<p>Being pleased, Kuchela, along with his wife, entered his abode, having hundreds of jewelled pillars and looking like great Indra&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p><strong>‘नूनं बतैतन्मम दुर्भगस्य<br>

<p>“For this prosperity coming to me, unfortunate and eternally poor, surely there can can be no other cause than my seeing the best of the Yadus, the Lord who is the great boundless”</p>
<p><strong>इत्थं व्यवसितो बुद्धया भक्तोऽतीव जनार्दने।<br>

<p>Making up his mind thus and becoming an (ever more) intense devotee of the Lord, Kuchela, with his wife, enjoyed (all) pleasures, not hankering too much after them but with a view to (gradually) renounce them.</p>

<p>Having killed the demons, with (the aid of) Balarama and the Yadus, Krishna relieved Earth of her burden by creating the mutual quarrel which would quicken destruction.</p>

<p>Taking as ostensible cause the sons of Pandu, who were provoked in the extreme by their enemies deceitful gambling, mocking, seizure of their queen by the hair and the rest, Krishna made the kings who had assembled (on the battle-field ) kill each other, and (thus) removed Earth’s burden.</p>

<p>Then, noticing grave evil portents appearing in Dvaraka, the Lord told the Yadu elders, who had gathered:</p>

<p>Thus commanded by the Lord, (the Yadavas) made ready their chariots. Seeing them get ready, get ready, Uddhava, ever devoted to Krishna, approached the overlord of the universe in solitude, bowed with his head at his feet, and said to Him with folded hands:</p>

<p>ТHE Purana is a reinforcement (<em>Upabrihmana</em>) of the teachings of the Vedas, with arguments for God and Dharma in the form of accounts of the creation, the sages, and the lives of the kings of the past. This is the real meaning of the traditional definition of the Purana as ‘<em>Panchalakshana</em>’. The supremacy of the Lord and Dharma is made the more explicit purpose of the Purana in the amplified <em>‘Dasalakshana’</em> (ten characteristics) given by the Bhagavata (II. 10. 1-7). The Lord, as Asraya, is given as the chief of these ten features of the Purana and along with this are introduced as definite subjects the stories of the incarnations which the Lord took for the re-establishment of His Kingdom and for the renaissance of Dharma on earth, and Salvation (Mukti). The first nine subjects only qualify the tenth, the <em>Asraya</em>, and are intended to strengthen it. <em>(Dasamasya visuddhyartham navanamiha lakshanam. II. 10.2).</em> In this, the Bhagavata shifts the emphasis from Principle to</p>
<p>Personality. The same emphasis on the Personality of the Lord is effectively laid in the preliminary story of the genesis of the Bhagavata, of how Vyasa, at the instance of Narada, composed the Bhagavata for singing exclusively of the Lord&rsquo;s glories and thus removing the depressing emptiness of his heart which he felt even after his composing the great Mahabharata and the other Puranas. The very name of the Purana shows that it is the lays of the Lord <em>par excellence.</em></p>
<p>Of the Principles, Dharma, Jnana and Vairagya, the Lord Himself is the embodiment. Devotion, Bhakti, to the Personality, the Lord, is to be achieved and its achievement means and includes the Principles also. Knowledge, Action, and Devotion—Jnana, Karma, Bhakti—as envisaged by the Bhagavata are neither exclusive of each other nor contradictory. To know truly is to is to love Him; and Devotion can be of the best form only when it is informedby Knowledge. Knowledge and Love must express themselves in Acts of Devotion. But the Lord seems to say in His discourse to Uddhava that the path of Devotion is the best for us, for it is suited to those who are attached to various interests in life on earth and yet have some spiritual yearnings. This seems to be the meaning of the saying that Bhakti is the path for the</p>
<p>Kali age. It is an age in which emotion is dominant; it is its spiritual harnessing that is Bhakti. And this has been woven into an allegorical story on the greatness of the Bhagavata, <em>the Bhagavata Mahatmya</em>, found in the Padma Purana.</p>
<p>Two of the problemsfacing the reader of the Bhagavata are the salvation of those that hate the Lord and wreck His Kingdom, and the story of the sports of Krishna with the women of the Gokula. In the stories of the demons, the Asuras and the Rakshasas, the Purana tackles the problem of evil (VII. 1. 1-3). The Asura is called a <em>Purvadeva</em>: the demon was a god; the being that is inherently and originally divine, errs and is, and is, through the story of a curse, made to be born as a demoniac force disturbing the peace of Dharma. The Asura or Rakshasa hates the Lord intensely and incessantly to hasten the time of the Lord&rsquo;s appearance to put an end to his evil self and to restore him to his original state. Death at the Lord&rsquo;s hands is invariably attended with the grant of salvation. This is nade plain in the story of <em>Jaya</em> and <em>Vijaya</em>, which lies at the very basis of the work.</p>
<p>Of the Love which the individual soul, caught in the meshes of a distracting world, is expected to develop for the Lord, the noblest image that has</p>
<p>occurred to the mystics of all religions is the Love of woman for man. The intensity and the fight against odds that this God-love means find find a parallel only in clandestine love. Hence the saying: Yosha <em>jaramiva priyam</em>. The mystic language of the Rasa is hardly stranger than that of Solomon&rsquo;s song of songs, or of St. Bernard&rsquo;s sermons, or of the writings of Coventry Patmore, which speak of Christ the bridegroom and Church the bride. “The Law and the Prophets describe pure by impure. Bride and Bridegroom are the highest images.” “Thy maker is Thy Husband.” That the Lord&rsquo;s dance with the cowherd women and their Love for Him mean something which has to be sought beyond their face-meaning must be very clear to anybody. For the Lord Himself tells the women when they seek Him: “The Love of those whose minds are absorbed in Me cannot be physical love: <em>Na mayyavesitadhiyam kamah kamaya kalpate.”</em> (X. A. 22-26.)</p>
