92FOREWORD 
Sri Bhagavatha Purana Commands Universal appeal to all the sections of the people. Being a work of great repute it excercised profound influence upon the philosophy and life of the people perhaps more than any other Purana. The spirit and purport of the Vedas are found hidden and so they are not under- stood by a common man whereas eternal truths enshrined in the Vedas are elucidated in this celebrated 
Purana. 
The Bhagavata has several outstanding features for which it has been extolled by the connoisseurs and after the advent of the Bhagavata many Puranas were either relegated to the background or eclipsed into oblivion. The Bhagavatha Purana is a happy synthesis of Veda, Purana and Kavya. It is said that Vedavyasa composed the Purana on the timely advice of the celestial sage Narada with a view to dispelling the gloom and depression, that had overcome him even after producing a magnum opus, Sri Mahabharata. The greatness of the Bhagavata has been rightly called as the Ambrosia or Amrita churned out of the milky ocean of the Vedas. The word 'Bhagavata' is very significant as it is replete with various senses. The five significant letters 'Bha', 'ga', 'va', 'ta' and 'm' suggest the quintessence of the Bhagavata 'Bha' stands for Bhakthi (the devotion) 'ga' for the Jnana (the knowledge), 'va' for vairagya (the renouncement of worldly wishes and passions), 'ta' for tattva (the real nature of the Supreme), and 'm' for moksha (the emancipa- tion from the worldly bonds). Hence a study of the Bhagavata yields all the four virtues. 
It is with a view to fulfilling the exacting demands of the scholarly world, the T.T.Devasthanams has undertaken the sacred task of bring out the critical edition of Sri Bhagavata with the commentaries of the three leading schools of Indian Philosophy, embellishing the text with all the special features of a critical edition. All the necessary efforts have been made by T.T.Devasthanams in this direction to make the Bhagavata available with in the reach of all at a subsidised price. So far, two thirds of the editorial work of the entire text have been completed and kept ready for printing. The first volume of (the first Skandha) the Bhagavata was edited and published in 1989. It is a matter of pleasure that it was critically acclaimed for its meticulous and flawless editing. 
After completing the editing of the second, third, fourth and fifth Skandhas, we have now taken up editing of the tenth Skandha, which is the heart of the Bhagavata, as it were, for, this skandha deals with the astounding exploits of Srikrishna Bhagavan. The Skandha has been split into three volumes and the first volume has been edited and will be published shortly. 
I am confident that this critical edition of the Bhagavata Purana will be useful for both the learned scholars and the seekers of Truth as well.

INTRODUCTION 
It goes without saying that the munificent Management of T.T.Devasthanams is making strenuous and incessant efforts for maintaining our cultural heritage enshrined in our veritable scriptures. It strains every nerve to sustain the Religio - Philosophic outlook wherein the Nation's peace and prosperity lies. With a view to reviving the Sanatana Dharma in the nation, to propagating and instilling the Bhakti in the minds of the Hindus, to conveying the message of Rishis to mankind, to disseminating the inestimable greatness of Hindu Culture for the benefit of common man the T.T.Devasthanams founded many an institution such as the "Dharma Prachara Parishad” "The Bhagavata Critical Edition Project”, “The Annamacharya Project”, “The Däsa Sähitya Project", "The Alwar Divya Prabandha Project", "The Recording Project”, "The Publication Cell" and the like. 
The Bhagavata Project is one among such establishments. The Śrīmad Bhāgavata of sage Krsnadvaipäyana Vyäsa occupiess a unique place not only in Sanskrit literature but also in the Indian Theosophy itself. Besides inculcating an unflinching faith in, an everlasting devotion to Lord Śrīmannārāyaṇa, this Mahāpurāṇa successfully deals with the unfoldment of the mysteries of the creation with scientific precision. A true follower of Bhaghavata Cult does not harbour hatred or illwill for any living being. Such are the teachings we obtain from the upakhyānas, stories and moral exposition. 
But, as ill - luck would have it, the Śrīmad Bhāgavata which has learned commentaries has not been available and a flawless mere text to facilitate even pārāyaṇa has become a rare commodity. Such being the case, the noble management of T.T.Devasthanams has undertaken the laborious and expensive enterprise of publishing a critical edition of the Srimad Bhagavata to meet a long-felt need for such an edition as ours. The Publication Department of T.T.D. has brought out a number of standard works on Agamas, Indian Philosophy, Art and Architecture, commentaries on Philosophical and Religious Texts, which have been well received by the scholarly devotee public. 
One need not offer any excuse for publishing so sacred a text such as the Śrīmad Bhagavata, since this Maha Purana commands universal appeal and popularity. It is believed to be an encyclopaedia of Bhakti Doctrine. It is a text 'Par-excellence' occupying the esteemed position among the eighteen Purāņas. The fact that while the great sage Veda Vyasa could not acquire peace of mind even after composing 
iii 
the Mahabharata the 'Magnum Opus'; he was advised by Narada the celestial sage to compose a Purāņa describing the marvellous exploits of Lord Sri Krishna to dispel mental depression - speaks volumes for the greatness of the Srimad Bhagavata, which has been accepted by all schools of Philosophy as the most authoritative text on a par with the sacred scripts, i.e. the Vedas. Because of its ever lasting popularity it has been commented upon by many great exegetists belonging to various Schools of Philosophical thoughts. The Srimad Bhagavata has been extolled that this is a 'navanīta' or butter secured by churning the milky ocean of the Vedas rendering it palatable to literates as well as illiterates who have an aptitude for obtaining the fruits of the study of the ancient Vedic lore. Further, the Srimad Bhagavata is regarded as the repositary of Bhakti (devotion) Doctrine with all its varieties and manifestations. Hence it is rightly called as the Bhakti Bhāṣya. 
Such being the case there is an imperative demand for a standard critical edition of the Srimad Bhagavata. It is true that already there are numerous commentaries on this Purana, published. But the editions so far published have mistakes in printing and matter, variations, deviations and interpolations in the original text as well as in the commentaries. However, there was no good attempt ever made to bring out an authentic version, on account of which confusion and absence of clarity were resulted, 
In fine, the preparation of a good critical edition of the Srimad Bhagavata, capable of warding off incongruity arising out of diverse versions, is the most important obligation. Having fully understood the value, greatness and the utter need for producing a flawless and correct text with important commentaries, the TTD Management decided that a sacred task of publishing a critical edition of the Srimad Bhagavata should be embarked on. Hence "The Bhagavata Critical Edition Project" was established 
in 1981. 
At the very outset it is quite but meet to mention the fact that as a result of the strenuous, devotional and combined efforts of trinity of scholars viz. (Late) Sri Kulapati Dr. Ekkirala Krishnamacharyulu the founder of the "World Teachers Trust", Visakhapatnam, Sri P.V.R.K.Prasad, LA.S., the then Executive Officer, T.T.Devasthanams, and Dr. Sri Pannala Radhakrishna Sarma, the then Principal, Matrusri Oriental College, Jellellamudi, the Srimad Bhagavata Critical Edition Project was established by the benign Management of T.T.Devasthanams which is a renowned institution consecrated to the proposion that the Bharatabhumi is to be made a Punyabhumi by establishing the Arsha Dharma in the country. The advent of the critical editions of the Mahabharata and the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa published by the Bhandarkar Oriental 
iv 
Research Institute, Poona and the Baroda Oriental Research Institute, Baroda, respectively has inspired Sanskrit lovers to take up similar projects. 
ŚRĪMAD BHĀGAVATA AND ITS PLACE 
The importance of the Bhāgavata will be easily realised if the following points are remembered: 
1. Almost the whole of Vaisnava population of India look on it as their main scripture on a par with the Upanisads and the Gita. 
2. It has been taken up by the founders or representative teachers of all sects even outside the Vaisnava fold for learned commentaries, just like the Gita and the Upanisads in order to prove its support to their respective teachings. 
3. Although there are eighteen Purāņas the Bhāgavata has outmoded all the others and has become the one work of this class studied reverently and interpreted and worshipped by devotees all over India. 
4. Apart from its superb poetry and the very wide range of its devotional teachings, the reason for its forceful and ever expanding appeal lies in its elaborate exposition of the life and message of "Śrī Kṛṣṇa”. 
5. "इतिहास पुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत्" is an ordinance issued by Vedavyāsa, wich emphasises that the purport of the Veda, the first and foremost record of human thoughts religious as well as metaphysical, should be substantiated by the Itihasas and the Purānas. Of these two categories the Purana is considered more important as the saying goes "that, which cannot be found either in the Veda or the Smrti, can be found in the Purāņa". Again, among the Purāņas the Bhāgavatapurāņa is considered to be the best. It was composed, unlike other Purāņas, by Vedavyäsa himself. Even after composing the Mahabharata, a text of encyclopaedic type, Vyasa did not have peace of mind. Then Narada advised him to compose this Purana, replete with Kṛṣṇa-bhakti to ward off his mental agony and unrest. 
6. Maharși Vedavyāsa who has been regarded as the incarnation of Mahāviṣṇu could get, the longed for mental peace by producing the Srimad Bhagavata replete 
with Kṛṣṇa-bhakti. 
VBULK OF BHAGAVATA 
According to the orthodox opinion the Bhagavata contains eighteen thousand verses, but the actual counting reveals that this contains fourteen thousand and odd passages, including prose passages. The reason for this difference lies in calculating the long prose passage as one. But the counting of prose passage is to be done as per the old practice, that thirty two letters are to be reckoned as one grantha or sloka. So the long prose passages have to be counted as many slokas as the number of letters allow and even the colophons are to be counted. Thus this calculation shows that the Bhagavata contains eighteen thousand verses. The Bhagavata now taken up for publication belongs to the category of Hindu Religious literature called the Puranas. 
THE DEFINITION OF PURĀNA 
Generally the Purāṇa is defined as an ancient history having five fold characteristics. 
"सर्गश्च प्रतिसर्गश्च वंशो मन्वन्तराणि च । वंशानुचरितश्चेति लक्षणानान्तु पञ्चकम् ।" 
The Purana dilates on the following five topics. They are: Sarga Primary creation of the categories, or evolution, Pratisarga - secondary creation or recreation of the Universe with the categories, Vamsa Manus, Rṣis, and Kings, Manvantara 


genealogies of Divinities, Demons, cosmic cycle ruled over by a Manu or a 
Patriarch and Vamśānucarita an account of royal dynasties. 
But this definition seems to hold good in respect of the Upapuraṇas only. The Mahāpurāņas should possess ten features as defined in the Brahmavaivarta. In this context the definition given by the Bhāgavata is to be remembered, according to which the Mahāpurāņa is Daśalakṣaṇa, while the Upapurana is Pancalakṣaṇa. The ten characteristics of a Purāņa are:- 
" अन सर्गो विसर्गश्च स्थानं पोषण मूतयः । 
मन्वन्तरेशानुकथा निरोधो मुक्ति राश्रयः || ” ( भाग 2-10-1 ) 
1. Sarga: The origin of the various categories from Mahat Tattva to the five gross elements (Bhütas) by the loss of equilibrium in Prakṛti caused by the divine will and their formation into Virāḍrüpa (or cosmic form) is called Sarga. 
vi 
2. Visarga: The creation of various beings by Brahma is called Visarga. 
3. Sthána or Sthiti: Sthāna consists in the activities of the Lord for the maintenance 
of the World in proper order. 
4. Poṣaṇa: Poṣaṇa is His granting protection to devotees who take shelter in Him. 
5. Üti: Úti consists in Karmic tendencies in latent and active form. 
6. Manvantara: Manvantara means the laws of righteous living as illustrated in the 
lines of great ones. 
7. Īsānukathā: This is the description of Hari's incarnations supplemented by the 
account of his devotees and their deeds. 
8. Nirodha: 
At the time of cosmic dissolution when Mahā Visņu lapses into yogic slumber all Jīvas retaining their bodies and tendencies in germinal condition become dissolved in Him. This is Nirodha. 
9. Mukti: Mukti is the Jīva's abidance in his prestine state of abandoning all entanglements 
in forms foreign to his nature. 
10. Aśraya: He out of whom the universe including the Jivas emerges at creation and in whom they are held in abeyance after dissolution. He, who is called by such names as Brahman and Paramätman is the Âśraya. 
The above mentioned characteristics (1 to 10) are dealt with in 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Skandhas respectively.

MODUS OPERANDI 
The following principles are adopted for noting down the variants and additional 
verses: 
1. The text in Edition No. 1 forms the Basis. 
2. The variants found in other editions with reference to the basis are recorded 
with names of the editions. 
3. The variants suggested by the commentators are noted as indicated by them. 
4. The variations which are indicated in the foot-notes of a particular edition and which are not found in any text or commentary of any other edition, are noted here that they are found in a particular edition. 
5. The variants, though noted in the foot-notes of a particular edition or editions, are not recorded in our edition if they are found in any text or commentary of any other edition. 
6. Additional Verses found in any edition are recorded by denoting the number of the preceding and proceeding verses between which the additional verses are 
IX 
placed. These additional verses found in only one version are not given serial numbers treating them to be interpolations. 
7. Omissions of a letter or a word in any edition or editions are recorded with 
reference to the basis. 
8. Pratikas are supplied by us to the commentary of Sridhara wherever they are found missing, keeping the style of Sridhara, the commentator, in mind, since we find pratika cited, to the majority of verses, at the beginning of the commentary. 9. The slight change, in the order of words, occurring in the verses of different editions, such as यद् बिभेति स्वयं भयम् and यद बिभेति भयं स्वयम् is ignored and not noted in the foot note, because the sense remains the same in either order. 
The idea in adopting the above principles is that, the variants or additional verses or omissmons found in all the above 11 editions are to be carefully recorded in this edition for the convenience of the readers to understand the spirit and purport of the original text of the Śrimad Bhagavata. 
Due to popularity of Sri Bhagavata Purāņa, many learned scholars belonging to different Vedantic Schools, tried their hands at writing commentaries on the Bhāgavata, in keeping with their tradition and philosophy. In this way they endeavoured to establish their own faith in a particular school of thought, taking full support from the Bhāgavata. The popularity of the Bhāgavata was so great that a great number of annotators have enriched their philosophy by these commentaries. 
A great many commentaries (about 30 for the Skandha X) are there on the Bhagavata. But we have taken only three famous commentaries belonging to the Advaita, Visistadvaita and Dvaita Schools of Vedanta. 
1. Sridharasvami is the earliest of all. He belongs to Sankara's Advaita Philosophy. It is learnt that Sridharaswami was the Mahant of the Sankarite monastery, Govardhan in about 1400 A.D. He says that he wrote his commentary, Bhāvārthadīpikā by name in strict adherence to the old tradition and followed the foot steps of Citsukhācārya. His commentary is lucid though brief, authoritative though reticent and direct to the point, and that is why most of the commentators have made use of this enlightening exegesis. Nabhadasji (Ref. Bhaktamala Chappaya 440) recorded a legend wherein it was stated that Lord Bindumadhava of Varanasi has recognised Sridhara's commentary as the authoritative interpretation of Śrī Bhāgavata. The commentators of the other schools also have paid him glorious tributes, and they have incorporated some important points from Sridhara's commentary, in their commentaries. Some commentators frankly, 
2 

Xadmitted that they have annotated the Bhagavata only to elucidate the ideas of Sridhara. Jivagosvami observes in his introductory verse that his commentary was intended to elucidate the commentary of Sridhara, where it was felt some what difficult to understand, and make it clear where it was otherwise. The facts mentioned above go a long way to assess the real worth of Sridhara's gloss. Sridhara refers to Bopadeva of the thirteenth century and is referred to by writers like *Visņupuri. So it can be inferred that he flourished in the middle of the 14th century. 
2. Sri Viraraghavacārya is a representative of the Visiṣṭādvaita school. He wrote a commentary on the Bhagavata. He rightly named his gloss the Candrika, for, this commentary is as pleasing as Candrika, or the moon-light, and throws much light on the text. It is an elaborate commentary supplying all the information required. He cited a great number of references in support of his view point. His knowledge of Śastras is vast and his erudition very deep. His explanations supported by diverse Sastras exceptionally good. It is believed that he belongs to the fourteenth century. He was the son of Śrīsaila of Vatsagotra. 
3. Sri Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha is another able commentator on the Bhāgavata. He belongs to the Dvaita School. His commentary is called Padaratnāvalī. He very closely follows the Bhagavatatatparyanirṇaya of Ananda Tīrtha, which is only a 
giving elaborate 
elucidation wherever it is felt absolutely necessary. The Padaratnavalï abounds in novel explanations and unique etymological derivations depending on Grammar and other Śastras. The text of the Bhāgavatapuraṇa taken up by Sri Vijayadhvaja records vast number of different readings, and alters the total number and the order of verses as well as the adhyayas. He is supposed to have lived in the 15th century A.D. 
APPENDICES 
APPENDIX 1: We have printed quarter - verse index arranging it in the alphabetical order. Though the task is strenuous and monotonous we have prepared it for the convenience of the scholars. Any quotation, from the Bhagavata, let it be full or half or quarter verse, occurring in any book under study can be found here in the index and its position can be known easily. 
APPENDIX 2: In this appendix we have enlisted the quotations occurring in all the commentaries. The commentators who are versatile scholars cite the passages profusely right from the Vedas to the contemporary works either with a view to elucidating the text or to substantiating their explanations or to inculcating the Philosophy more effectively, or to infusing the spiritual consciousness into

the hearts of the readers or to kindling the Bhakti or devotion in the votaries towards the God. It was aimed at tracing the sources of the quotations. The number of quotations being prodigious, source tracing proved to be an onerous task. But we have ventured to embark on this new enterprise, bearing in mind the oft-quoted saying 'अप्यप्रसिद्धं यशसे हि पुंसा मनन्यसाधारण मेव कर्म' which has served as an impetus in this respect. Despite our endeavour, we could not trace the sources of all the quotations. However, we have succeeded in tracing more than eighty per cent sources. But at some places we could not mention the sub-divisions, i.e. Adhyāya, Sarga, Parva, Śloka et cetera. Hence we have given only the name of the text of very voluminous works such as Skända, where tracing is almost impossible. 
It is hoped that the readers are enabled to refer to the original source - texts and benefitted by obtaining more information. We have noted, in brackets the name of the source text and the numbers of the subdivision of the texts, immediately after the respective quotations, in the text of the commentary itself. Not content with this act, we have prepared separately a list of quotations along with the name of the sources et cetera, and arranged them in the alphabetical order and added the same to the text as appendix-2. 
1. GOPIKRISHNA EPISODE: ITS INTERPRETATIONS 
Critics have not been wanting who have cavelled at the moral stature of Krishna for his questionable relationship with the Gopis and the propriety of a devotional text like the Bhagavata including in itself such highly erotic episodes and their graphic descriptions. So various attempts have been made to get over these difficulties by several theories, some of the most important of which are as follows: 
1. The whole episode of Krishna and Gopikas is symbolical and not factual. The Gopikas stand for the soul (Jivatman) and Krishna for the Supreme Soul (Paramatman) and the intense aspiration of the former for the latter is depicted through sexual love. The Jiva in this philosophy is taken as the Prakriti of the Lord and therefore depicted as female. In this theory historicity of the events described is either denied or overlooked, and only a symbolic meaning is attached 
to the events. 
The following matter 
under 
three headings has 
been 
taken from the Introduction of Sri Bhagavata translation by Swami Tapasyananda (Vol.III, Skandha I). I gratefully acknowledge the valuable help obtained. 
xii 
2. The Bhagavata states that Krishna was only a boy of ten or eleven at that time. So the highly erotic descriptions of the relationship between Him and Gopikas, who are depicted as ladies of mature years, are only poetic exaggerations of some innocent pastoral sports of Krishna with boys and girls of the cowherd community, among whom he spent his boyhood days. The eroticism superimposed on these should be taken only as an aberration of decadent sectaries. Here historicity is accepted in a modified form and the existence of any ethical problem is denied. 
3. According to the third theory, while historicity is accepted, it is maintained that the Gopikas were devoid of bodily consciousness and they met Krishna at a spiritual level. Therefore there is nothing carnal about it, as the descriptions are of purely mystical significance. In support of this reference is made to the Bhagavata verse— 
"नाऽसूयन् खलु कृष्णाय मोहिता स्तस्य मायया । 
मन्यमानाः स्वपार्श्वस्थान् स्वान् स्वान् दारान् ब्रजौकस : ||" [भाग १०-३३-३८] 
which states that while the Gopikas were away engaged in Rasalila their people found them at house also. This mystic element is also hinted at in the very beginning of the description of Rasalila in the statement that Krishna took part in it assuming his Yogamaya or Mystic power. 
2. BHAGAVATA INTERPRETATION OF THE LOVE OF THE GOPIKAS : 
Now what does the Bhagavata itself say on the point? While it is true that the Bhagavata text holds forth hints, justifying all the three explanations given above, the overwhelming evidence of language and description of the text declares inequivocally that the Gopika episode was a physical fact and that all aspects of love were involved in the relationship. Ranch Parikshit to whom the Bhagavata was narrated, takes it in that sense and questions Sri Suka whether there was any ethical propriety, at all in it. In his famous reply to this Sri Suka does not explain away the facts but expounds their significance as follows: "Divine personages are found to override the rules of Dharma (ethics) and do actions apparently for a shocking nature. But just as no impurity affects fire, which consumes every thing, nothing causes blemish to such persons of immense potency. But lesser men should not imitate them in these respects even in mind. If they do so foolishly they will perish, as one will do if one drinks poison following the example of Rudra. The instructions of Godly persons are valid; SO are some of their actions too. A wise man will follow only such of their actions as are consistent with their words. It is admitted that for enlightened men without an ego-sense, there is no selfish gain to be attained by any actions and no evil to be warded off by abstinence from them what good or evil can then affect the Supreme Lord Krishna who is the Master of all beings Devas, men, animals and the rest? By devotion to His holy feet the great sages derive that Yogic power by which they become free from the bondage of all action. How can there be any bondage or sin for the Universal Being, 

xii 
who has assumed a body out of his own will, and by devotion to whom even these great sages derive their spiritual excellence. He who permeates all beings, including the Gopikas and their husbands and directs minds and senses of everyone even He out of sportive intention has assumed a body as Krishna. For bestowing His blessings on all beings he has assumed a body and he sports with that body in ways that will interest and attract men to Him. By Krishna's mystic power the inhabitants of Vraja found their woman in their homes all the time and had no occasion to be displeased with Krishna. (Bhag X-33-30 to 38) 
From this it is clear that just as Krishna faced Kamsa and Sisupala (examples of communion through confrontation) with weapons in hand and raised them to the height of spiritual glory by delivering deadly blows on them. He received the Gopikas who came to him with passionate love stimulated by his exquisite physical charm and the ravishing strains of His flute (Venugana) as an earthly lover receives his beloved, although mentally He was unperturbed and ever-poised in His spiritual Essence. But what starts as a physical passion in the Gopikas gets transformed into a pure spiritual experience in the course of their association with Krishna. By the touch of Krishna, who in the words of Gita is 'Brahman Supreme, the most exalted state of existence and the seat of all purity and holiness', the Kamukis (lustful females) and the Abhisarikas (the passionate women going in search of their lovers) became converted into Premikas (persons endowed with rapturous loving devotion) transcending body-consciousness like the Paramahamsas. If we remember the aspect of Gopi Krishna episode we shall find that Krishna needs no defence and we need not be apologetic about Him by taking refuge in allegorical interpretations. The allegory and symbolism are there and are very important too, but we should not use them to over look or cover up the Bhagavata doctrine that when the mind is firmly fixed on Him, what ever might be the motivating feeling or circumstance. He responds to the Jiva in a manner appropriate to the Jiva's attitude and transforms him by His touch. As stated in the Bhagavata; "The Yogis concentrating their mind on Him as the indwelling self the philosophers who try to see Him as pervading every thing, the Asuras who live in mortal dread of, and in confrontation with Him, and the passionate women who seek physical union with Him in violation of all social and ethical sanctions they are all alike to Him (Bhag. X. 87-23). The fact that the minds of all these are directed to Him with intensity is sufficient reason for their transformation when they receive His response in the manner appropriate to their respective attitudes. In a study of Krishna's life we should not forget that the Bhagavata looks upon Him not as an oridnary man but as "Bhagavan svayam". Supreme Being Himself manifests as man, to reveal how He becomes the many but continues to be the one Uncorrupted and Perfect Being inspite of His transformation into the many through His Sakti. To attribute corruption to Krishna for any of His actions is therefore as proper or as absurd as attributing corruption to God for manifesting the enigmatic world. All His actions were without any self-centred purpose and were only the expression of the Lord's redeeming love for the 
XIV 
Jivas. Being the one existence that has become the many, He is supra-moral and human standards have no relevance in His case. 
3. WHY THE MEDIUM OF EROTIC POETRY IS USED? 
Regarding the other allied question about the propriety of these erotic descriptions in a devotional scripture, the Bhagavata has got its own answer. The Lord incarnated as Krishna not merely for scholars, philosophers, ascetics, puritans and moralists, but for the good of all who could develop faith in Him irrespective of their spiritual, cultural and moral attainments. A philosopher will be interested only in abstract thought and not in heroic exploits and adventurous stories, on the other hand, a boy or a person without education will only be bored by philosophy, but thrilled by a narration of such exploits and adventures. A diplomat or a politician will not however, be moved by these, he will probably be interested in accounts of state craft and human relationship. An artist or a connoisseur of beauty will have a dread of philosophy and ethics but will be attracted by highly artistic descriptions of romantic love and beauty in all its aspects. The life and teachings of Krishna, the Purnavatara, is meant to attract men of all these types. So in a life abounding in dealings with persons of varied temperaments philosophers, devotees, ascetics common folk, cowherds, lovelorn women, cruel monsters, oppresive kings, righteous rulers diplomats etc. Krishna has left for mankind a rich and varied record of events which have been taken up and glorified by the Puranas for edifying and attracting even the so called sense-bound humanity to the devotional cult founded by Him. In later times a great devotee-poet of India, Jayadeva, has probably for this very reason taken up the love relationship of Krishna with the Gopikas as the theme for his famous Gitagovinda, a poetical work of rare literary and musical excellence, noted as much for its devotional significance as for its high eroticism, observing all the rules of Sanskrit poetics. No one can gainsay the fact that this work has exercised a great influence on the devotional and artistic life of India and drawn to Krishna large number of people who would not have otherwise been attracted to God at all. So in justification of its description of these amorous accounts, the Bhagavata itself says "Having assumed a human body for the blessings of mankind, He adopted such sportive activities as will interest and attract men of various types to Him.... He who with faith in Krishna in his heart hears reads and narrate these amorous dalliances of His with the Gopis, that intelligent man will obtain deep devotion to the Lord and will easily overcome lust, the real 'heart disease' of mankind” (Bhag, 10-33-37 to 40). 
A 
The idea is that the mind of an aspirant with faith in Krishna will gradually be filled with the symbolic and spiritual significance of these descriptions, that it is the passion of the purified soul of man for God that is represented in the Gopikas, longing for Krishna and that if we imitate that passion within ourselves we shall attain to the divine. To several of "his puritanical disciples who expressed disapproval of the Gopikas, love for Krishna on moral grounds, Sri Ramakrishna, who never questioned the factuality of the Gopikrishna episode, never-the-less 
Xreplied that if they did not like the Gopikas they might forget them but they must consider themselves blessed if they could manifest towards God a hundredth of that intensity of feeling that the Gopikas had towards Krishna, the Lord of all that exists. The contention of the Bhagavata is that the Gopikas have dug this unique channel of devotion to God by their example, and that none can reach Him in that form of intimacy and intensity unless they sail their boat. along the channel they have dug. 
A careful reader of the Bhagavata will note that the text is careful to trace the growth of the love of the Gopikas for Krishna from a passionate personal love to love of Him as the Universal Being. Unlike devotees in general, they did not, it is true, pass through the earlier stages of devotional discipline. Being fortunate enough to be the contemporaries of Sri Krishna, the Lord Incarnate their purification was effected by direct contact with Him. Sexual attachment is ordinarily a cause of spiritual down fall, but in the Gopikas such attachment, being directed to Sri Krishna, the Lord Incarnate had the opposite effect of purifying and uplifting them. Reciprocating their love Krishna blessed them with His divine company, but they were soon separated from him when he left Gokula for Mathura from where he sent them the message, "Separation only strengthens love. Soon you will attain to the joy of Brahman which will make you experience separation and union as equally blissful" (Narayaneeyam). When they met him again at Syamantapanchaka some years after they were found to have developed that depth of love through the tormenting yet delightful pangs of separation. On that occasion Krishna gave them full enlightenment that enabled them realise His presence in everything and everywhere. He conveyed to them the following as his last message. "Devotion to me is the only means for attaining to Bliss undecaying. It is fortunate that you have developed attachment to Me which is the means for attaining to Me. Just as all material objects have their beginning and their end infilled by these elements, in the same way understand Me to be the basis of, and the Substance pervading all the worlds, living and non-living. Living beings only experience objects, but the latter do not rest in them (the living beings) but in the lements constituting them. It is, however, in and through Me, the Supreme and imperishable Being, that both these the experiencing Jivas and the experienced objects constituted of elements have their entity and subsistance". (Bhag. X-82-45-47). It will also be seen from this kind of Bhakti is not Müdha, ignorant of Divine excellence; it may be so et the stert, but it brings full enlightenment too. Enlightenment only leads to the enrichment and not to the elimination of devotion. 
INTERPRETATION OF THE VASTRĀPAHARAṆA 
The story of the stealing away of the garments by Kṛṣṇa is intriguing as well as interesting. It was not unusual for the womenfolk of certain parts in

India to remove all their clothes before getting down into a tank or river for a bath. They usually left their clothes on the bank of the river or tank and went into the water. In the Punjab, it is said, that women bathing without clothes on was a common sight till recently. It was probably also prevalent in certain other parts of the country. Assuming that the author of the Bhagavata was familiar with the habits of the people of Āryāvarta, this stealing of the garments can be explained easily. Thus when Kṛṣṇa saw the clothes of women lying on the bank, he, being a naughty child (naughtiness in childhood bring the sign of greatmen in general) carried them away and gave them back, only when he was appeased with uplifted 
The stories given in the Bhāgavata Purāņa need not be fictitious. What is more probable is that the incidents related actually happened. The author narrates them but does not stop them. He gives the incidents another hidden meaning and uses them as allegories to serve his greater purpose of the search after truth. 
Thus, as already stated, the Purañjana legend has been treated as an allegory by the author. In the stealing of the garments also the author tries to tell us repeatedly that the soul's surrender to the Supreme must be unconditional. The gopis had to lift up their arms in order to get back their garments. It is the same with any bhakta. His surrender must be wholehearted if he wants to please his God. 
The author employes the Räsalīlā as another allegory illustrating in vivid language and imagery the relation between the Supreme Being and His bhaktas.
