FOREWORD 
Srimad Bhagavatam has a unique place among the Hindu puranas because of the popular appeal of pure Bhakthi which is its dominant theme. 
In the Bhagavatham, written in the ancient Sanskrit Language, one can find practi- cally, everything which, in one way or the other goes to contribute to the structure of a huge philosophic and contemplative edifice. Besides being an ancient work of ornate poetry, Srimad Bhagavatam like a prism reflects the varied facets of Indian culture. 
The Bhagavatam has been aptly described as the spiritual butter churned out of the ocean of the Veda Milk for the benefit of those 'who are pure in heart, free from malice and envy, and are keen to hear it'. Dry philosophy seldom appeals to the human mind. But in the Bhagavatam even the most abstruse philosophic truths are put across by means of stories and legends. This is the secret of its popularity among all classes of people. 
Vedavyasa, the composer of this encyclopaedia of Bhakthi doctrine, who could not have peace of mind even after composing Mahabharatam, was advised by Narada, a celestial sage, to compose this Purana describing deeds of Lord Sri Krishna to get rid of mental depression. This reveals the greatness of Srimad Bhagavatam which occu- pied a place on a par with Vedas, the sacred scriptures. 
All-out efforts are being made by the T.T. Devasthanams to foster and encourage the Hindu Dharma and Culture in India and abroad. With this objective in view, the T.T. Devasthanams has taken steps to accelerate its publication activities during the last few years. The Publications Department has already brought out a number of standard works on the Agamas, Indian Philosophy, Art and Architecture. They include highly philosophical works and commentaries on religious texts. 
The T.T. Devasthanams has undertaken the publication of a critical edition of the sacred scripture 'Srimad Bhagavatam' in Sanskrit with Trimata commentaries. This superb edition with commentaries on the whole of the Bhagavatam is a master-piece in the field of the scriptural literature in India. 
To our knowledge, there is no edition or exposition of this type on the Bhagavatam brought out hitherto. We hope, the first volume of this much awaited book now being released will be well received by the readers. 
Dr. P. Radhakrishna Sarma, Editor and his colleagues deserve congratulations for the interest they have evinced in bringing out this volume in a befitting manner.

善INTRODUCTION 
The advent of the critical editions of the Mahabharata and the Välmiki Rāmāyaṇa published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, and the Baroda Oriental Research Institute, Baroda, respectively has inspired Sanskrit Scholars to take up similar projects. The idea of a critical edition of the Śrimad Bhagavata which occupies a unique place among the Purāņas and which has been commented upon by various scholars of different schools of thought such as the Advaita, Višiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita has gripped on to my mind in the recent past. 
The Matrusri Vidya Parishat, the Managing Committee of Matrusri Oriental College, of which I was the founder Principal, though appreciative of my ideas could not give me a helping hand for want of sufficient funds. As such my wish to undertake a critical edition of the Srimad Bhāgavata remained only a day dream for a few years. 
During one of my visits to Tirupati towards the end of 1979, I casually mentioned about the necessity of bringing out a critical edition of the Śrimad Bhagavata to Sri P. V. R. K. Prasad, / A S,the then Executive Officer of T. T. Devasthanams and requested him that this project might be taken up by the T.T. D. Management which is the only competent institution from the point of finances, Hindu culture and religion. Sri Prasad immediately advised me to prepare and submit a project report. But owing to my preoccupations I could not immediately act in this direction. After a few months, I consulted Prof. P. Sriramamurti of the Sanskrit Department of Andhra University and Kulapati Dr. E. Krishnamacharya, the founder of the World Teacher Trust, Visakhapatnam and with their valuable advice and co-operation I prepared the project report and placed it before Sri Prasad on 17-10-1980. He, taking cognizance of the importance of the scheme, placed it before the Management Committee which approved of it in toto. It was also decided in the same meeting that I should be the Director of the project and it was conveyed to me in the month of April, 1981. 
I placed the offer of T. T. D. before the Matrusri Vidya Parishat, Jillellamudi, Guntur District with a request to depute me to T. T. D. for organising this project. The Parishat graciously accorded permission to me with their blessings and I joined the service of T. T. D. on 3-7-1981. I am very grateful to the Holy Mother of Jillellamudi and the members of the Matrusri Vidya Parishat. 
Then an Editorial Board was constituted with the Executive Officer and project Director as Ex-Officio Chairman and Convener of the project respectively. The Editorial Board met on 18-9-1981 and suggested to the project Director to visit the famous Oriental Research Institutes at different places which have successfully completed similar projects, to study the technique of a critical edition. Accordingly, I, along with Sri M. Ramakrishna Sastri, now the Controller of Publications, T. T. D. visited Bombay and Ahmedabad. 
At Ahmedabad we learnt that the B. J. Institute of Learning and Research had already embarked on a similar project of critical edition of the Śrīmadbhāgavata some 15 years ago and so far they finished the collation of the Bhāgavata manuscripts in Devanagari that were available in North India. They were yet to collate manuscripts in south Indian Scripts. The Progress of the project had been at slow pace for various 
reasons. 
Immediately after returning we discussed all this with the members of the Editorial Board. During discussions, the members suggested that the Bhāgavata be published with the commentaries of the three important schools of Vedanta viz. the Advaita, Visiṣṭädvaita and Dvaita. Therefore, it was decided that the text of the Srimad Bhagavata, along with the commentaries of Śridhara, Virarāghava and Vijayadhvaja, should be carefully edited. 
Sri M. Ramakrishna Sastri was requested to study the manuscripts of the Śrimadbhāgavata available in the S. V. Oriental Research Institute, Tirupati and in the Adyar Library and Research Centre, Madras. His study of some select manuscripts in Telugu, Grantha, Nandinagari etc., at the above places has revealed that the texts on hand are quite upto the mark when compared with the manuscripts at the above places. Hence we thought that we need not collate our texts with those available at the places mentioned above. This procedure will substantially reduce the period of critically editing the text, and will provide an opportunity, for editing the said three Sanskrit Commentaries and bringing out this edition in a short time for the convenience of the Sanskrit reading public in general and the scholars in particular as even a bare text of the Srimad Bhagavata has become rare. And as proposed in the original Project Report, my lucid commentary in Sanskrit namely Sudhisudhā is added here. 
ŚRIMAD BHAGAVATA AND ITS PLACE 
"The importance of the Bhagavata will be easily realised if the following points are remembered: 
1. Almost the whole of Vaiṣṇava population of India look on it as their main scripture on a par with the Upanisads and the Gita. 
2. It has been taken up by the founders or representative teachers of all sects even outside the Vaisnava fold for learned commentaries, just like the Gita and the Upanisads in order to prove its support to their respective teachings. 
3. Although there are eighteen Purāņas the Bhāgavata has outmoded all the others and has become the one work of this class studied reverently and interpreted and worshipped by devotees all over India. 
4. Apart from its superb poetry and the very wide range of its devotional teachings, the reason for its forceful and ever expanding appeal lies in its elaborate exposition of the life and message of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.” 
"इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां वेदं समुपबृंहयेत्" is an ordinance issued by Vedavyasa, which emphasises that the purport of the Veda, the first and foremost record of human thoughts, religious as well as metaphysical, should be substantiated by the Itihāsas and the Purāņas. Of these two categories the Purāņa is considered more important as the saying goes "that, which cannot be found either in the Veda or the Smṛti, can be found in the Purana. Again, among the Purăņas the Bhāgavatapurāņa is considered to be the best. It was composed, unlike other Puràņas, by Vedavyäsa himself. Even after composing the Mahābhārata, a text of encyclopaedic type, Vyäsa did not have peace of mind. Then Nārada advised him to compose this Purāṇa, replete with Kṛṣṇa-bhakti to ward off his mental agony and unrest. 
According to the orthodox opinion the Bhāgavata contains eighteen thousand verses, but the actual counting reveals that this contains fourteen thousand and odd passages, including prose passages. The reason for this difference lies in calculating the long prose passage as one. But the counting of prose passage is to be done as per the old practice, that thirty two letters are to be reckoned as one grantha or sloka. So the long prose passages have to be counted as many šlokas as the number of letters allow and even the colophons are to be counted. Thus this calculation shows that the Bhāgavata contains eighteen thousand verses. The Bhagavata now taken up for publication belongs to the category of Hindu Religious literature called the Puranas. 
DERIVATION OF THE WORD PURÂṆA 
The word Purāņa is derived in different ways- 1. पुरा भवं पुराणम्। पुराण is one, which originated in the grand old days. 
2. gufti ad you— though it belonged to remote past, it looks new on account of ever-fresh value of its subject matter. 
3. The word पुरा means, both past and future. पुरा आगतानागतौ अणति कथयति इति पुराणम् (the root of the verb अपति is अण शब्दे) The Purana tells us about the past and future alike. 
4. The Vayupurāņa defines thus — since the text tells about the past events, it is called Purāņa and he, who knows this etymology, will be liberated from the sins and so on. 
ORIGIN OF THE PURĀNA 
Though the Purāņas have begun to take the present shape only from the 5th or 6th century B. C. the nucleus from which the present developed shape is formed, was as old as Vedasarhhitas. The Purāna is found mentioned in Atharvaveda (11-7-24) for the first time where it is said that the Purāņa originated in the for (sacrificial residue) along with the Ṛks, Sāmans and Chandas. Again the Purāņa is mentioned in the Satapatha Brahmana and Gopatha Brāhmaṇa. The Bṛhadaranyaka Upanisad states- 
"अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसित मेतत् यदृम्वेदो यजुर्वेद सामवेदोऽथर्वाङ्गिरसः पुराणं विद्या उपनिषदः श्लोकाः सूत्राणि ।” etc. (6.3. 2-4-10), in other words all the Vedas, Purāņas et cetera have arisen from the breath of Paramatman. 
In all the above references the word Purāņa is used in singular number. So it can be inferred that the Purāņa was a branch of Vedic learning and not diversified specific religious text as it stands now. Recital of Purāņas was a part and parcel of the sacrifice as the Purāņas were supposed to be the encyclopaedias of old traditional fore. The recital was done at the intervals of long protracted sacrifices such as Ašvamedha, Räjasüya and the like. As time passed on the Purāņas were assigned the secondary place, since it was held that the purāṇapäṭha was not an integral part of sacrificial rites. Sage Vedavyasa who is just famous for the codification of all the Vedas, systematically codified all the Puräāņas also bifurcating this literary part from the Vedas. The Sûtas who were reciting them in their turn elaborated the Purāņas catering for the needs and taste of the people of the changing society from age to age. The Vedas, being systematically codified by the keen and meticulous care of Vedavyāsa, remained unaltered for ever, whereas the Purāņas had undergone periodical changes and grew into a special vast body of Indological know-how. The changes in the nature of Purāņas were going on, it was believed, from the fifth or sixth century B. C. till the 12th century A. D. As the Apastambadharmasūtras (600-300 B. C.) cite a passage from the Bhaviṣyapuräṇa, it can be guessed that the Purāņa might have become a recognisable, specialised literary composition, by that time. 
When the Purāņas grew unwieldy, they were divided into two groups as Mahāpurāņas and the Upapuranas. The Mahāpurāņas are eighteen in number. They are- (1) the Brahma (2) Pădma (3) Viṣņu (4) Vāyu (5) Bhāgavata (6) Năradiya (7) Märkandeya (8) Värāha (9) Agni (10) Bhaviṣya (11)Brahmavaivarta (12) Linga (13) Skanda (14) Vămana (15) Kürma (16) Mätsya (17) Gäruḍa and (18) Brahmānḍa. The above order does not signify any importance or preference. The number eighteen stood fixed by the 7th century A. D. The number eighteen was considered to be a sacred one. In this connection the attention of the readers is invited to the following fact — the number of parvas in the Mahābhārata, the Vidyästhānas, the Dvipas and the adhyayas of the Bhagavadgita, is only eighteen. As such they have restricted the number of the Purāņas to eighteen. But the composition of the Purāņas did not stop there. The Purāņas grew in number by leaps and bounds. They were not given serial number as nineteen, twenty and so on. But they were called the Upapurāņas or subsidiary ones. Another group of Purāņas also, eighteen in number arose owing to the advent of new ideas, diverse sects, novel subjects and the like. The number did not stop even here. The Purāņas multiplied till they reached the number thirty four. 
The south Indians call the Brahmavaivartapurāņa as the Brahmakaivarta. Though the Vayupurāṇa is listed among the Mahāpurāņas the Śaivapurāṇa which has a claim to be listed is not included. But the Šaivapurāņa is not different from the Vayu Purāņa, as Matsyapurāņa observes : 
"यत्र तद्वायवीयं स्यात् रुद्रमाहात्म्यसंयुतम् । चतुर्विशत्सहस्राणि पुराणं शैव मुध्यते ॥" 
From the above reference, it is evident that, the Väyupurăṇa described the glory of Siva in twenty four thousand verses is justly called Śaivapurāṇa. The Bhāgavatapurāņa in its thirteenth canto of twelfth Skandha enumerates the slokas of each Purāņa as following:

According to the Padmapurâṇa these Purāņas are diveded into three categories, namely (1) The Sättvika (2) Rājasa and (3) Tămasa. 
Väräha. 
The Sättvika Purāņas are (1) The Vaiṣṇava (2) Nāradiya (3) Bhāgavata (4) Gäruḍa (5) Pädma and (6) 
The Rājasa Purāņas are (1) The Brahmanda (2) Brahmavaivarta (3) Märkandeya (4) Bhaviṣya (5) Vamana and (6) Brähma. 
The Tamasa Puranas are (1) The Matsya (2) Kaurma (3) Linga (4) Šaiva (5) Skända and (6) Agneya. 
The Kaurma Purāņa (1-1-17 to 20) enlists Upapurāņas thus (1) The Purana narrated by Sanatkumāra, (2) Nārasimha, (3) Skända narrated by Kumāra, (4) Śivadharmapurāņa, narrated by Nandikesvara, (5) The Purāṇa narrated by Durvāsas, (6) Nāradokta, (7) Kāpila, (8) Mānava, (9) the Purāṇa narrated by Ušanas (Šukra), (10) Brahmānḍa, (11) Vāruṇa, (12) Kālikāpurāṇa, (13) Māheśvara, (14) Sāmba, (15) Saura, (16) the Purana narrated by Parásara, (17) Mārica Purāņa, and (18) Bhāskarapurāṇa.* 
THE DEFINITION OF PURANA 
Generally the Purāņa is defined as an ancient history having five fold characteristics. 
"सर्गच प्रतिसर्गश्च वंशो मन्वन्तराणि च । वंशानुचरितचेति लक्षणानान्तु पञ्चकम्॥" 
The Purāņa dilates on the following five topics. They are: Sarga― Primary creation of the categories or evolution, Pratisarga - secondary creation or recreation of the Universe with the categories, 
*I acknowledge Sri G. V. Tagare and Śrí Svám: Tapasyänanda 
cosmic cycle ruled 
Vamsa - genealogies of Divinities, Demons, Manus, Rṣis, and Kings, Manvantara over by a Manu or a Patriarch and Varhśänucarita — an account of royal dynasties. 
But this definition seems to hold good in respect of the Upapuräņas only. The Mahāpurāņas should possess ten features as defined in the Brahmavaivarta. In this context the definition given by the Bhāgavata is to be remembered, accoding to which the Mahāpuraṇa is Daśalakṣaṇa; while the Upapurāņa is Pancalakṣaṇa. The ten characteristics of a Purāņa are— 
J 
" as a free स्थानं पोषण भूतयः । 
ugerntenganar frùm qfa 09:11′′ (414. 2-10-1) 
(1) Sarga subtle creation, (2) Visarga 
protection, welfare of all, (5) üti 
God, (4) Poşana - 
gross creation, (3) Sthāna - law and order ensured by 
material lust for karmas, (6) Manvantara (katha) the 
accounts of the deeds of the Lord, (8) the last resort of the Universe on the 
periods of Manus and the history of that epoch, (7) īśānukathā Nirodha -- physical annihilation, (9) Mukti — liberation (10) Aśraya Ultimate Reality. These characteristics may slightly vary from book to book. 
THE AUTHORSHIP OF ŚRĪ BHÄGAVATA 
The authorship of Sri Bhagavata, was doubted by the adherents of the Sakta cult. According to 
them :- 
1. Bopadeva a renowned scholar and a protege of the king, Hemadri, composed the Bhāgavatapurāņa to please his king, in the name of Vyasa in order to give it the status of Vyasa's works. Hemadri, being much pleased, took necessary steps to popularise the text in the name of Vyasa. He got prepared a large number of copies for propagation. Some scholars wrote commentaries on the same at the behest of the king. 
But a careful examination reveals that those who wanted to establish the supremacy of the Devibhāgavata over the Viṣṇubhāgavata, which establishes the supremacy of Vişņu over all the Gods, endeavoured to show that the Devibhāgavata was the composition of Vedavyâsa and as such only the Devibhāgavata was genuine and the Visnu Bhagavata was a later composition. 
In this connection it is interesting to recall a legend that Bopadeva, a friend of Hemadri, who was a minister to Rāmarāya, who ruled from Devagiri (1271-1309 A. D.) agreed to narrate the Bhagavata in two muhurtas with all its important events, as a challenge in the Royal Court and accomplished this, by providing the Bhāgavatasära. 
The verse- 
" श्रीमद्भागवताध्यायसारोात्र निरूप्यते । 
विदुषा बोपदेवेन मन्तिहेमाद्रितुष्टये ।।" 
testifies this. 
Again he composed the Bhaktimuktäphala and Bhaktilahari. At the end of the commentary on the Bhaktimuktāphala he states that he produced three works- narrating the sum and substance of the Bhagavata. Further, Bopadeva states that he studied the Bhāgavata twenty times, before he composed the books. He extolled Sri Bhāgavata and paid homage to the sage Vyasa. In view of the above facts, it can be decided that he did not compose the Bhagavata. Hence to ascribe the authorship of the original text to the author of an abridgement, seems rather ridiculous. 
More over, Vijayadhvaja - a reputed commentator on the Bhāgavatapurāṇa · - has stated that Śri Sankarācārya (8th century A. D.) wrote a commentary on the Bhagavata. One more interesting and deciding point against the authorship of Bopadeva is noted here. Sri Gauḍapădăcărya (7th century A. D.) quotes in his commentary on Uttaragita two verses from the Bhāgavata, beginning with "Bught vis gee”"तदुक्तं भागवते. 
( भाग. 10-14-4), and "जयाह (जगृहे) पौरुष रूपम्" (भाग 1-3-1) and again in the course of the commentary on the same text quotes a half verse from the Bhāgavata 
तेषा मसौ क्लेश एवं शिष्यते नान्य द्यथा स्थूलतुषावघातिनाम्" ( भाग 10-14-4)) 
Bopadeva, it is said, belonged to the 13th century, A. D. Hence the absurdity, in ascribing the authorship of the Bhagavata which is cited by Śri Gauḍapādācārya, and commented by Sankarācārya of the 7th and 8th century respectively to Bopedeva of the 13th century, is evident. 
2. The second argument of Šāktas is as follows: The style of composition of Vyasa found in the Bharata, the Skanda Purana and the Padmapurana et cetera is simple and easy as these texts are written in the Pancali Riti, whereas the style of the Bhagavata is a hard nut to crack since it was composed in Gaudi Riti. Hence we may say that the Bhagavata seems to belong to the later day poetic style. In other words, the style of the Bhagavata is quite different from that of the Mahabharata et cetera. As such the authorship of the Bhagavata can not be ascribed to Vedavyāsa. 
The above argument though seems plausible, holds no water. The difference in style in the works of the same author is seen in many a place. It is well known that various works composed by Sri Sankarācārya show vast difference. The style of the Harṣacarita is not so mellifluous and euphonious as that of the Kādambari though they were composed by one and the same author, Bhaṭṭabāṇa. The styles of the Raghuvamsa and the Meghaduta differ widely. So the tendency to fix the authorship of the texts basing on difference in style is not healthy. The style of expression may differ, from book to book by the same author, depending on so many factors as the age, the subject matter, the mental set up at a given time, tenacity of purpose, the devotional fervour and so on. The purpose of the Mahabharata is to teach Dharma to those, who are not qualified to learn the Vedas, in an easy style by illustrating through wonderful stories, whereas the Bhagavata is intended only to the enlightened select scholars, since it is full of high philosophical ideas. There was a special purpose in writing this Bhagavata since it was composed on the advice of Narada to elevate his own self. The Bhāgavata, as the scholars opine, elucidates the Brahmasūtras and contains the essence of Upanisadic lore. Vyāsa must have adopted somewhat tough style quite becoming to the theme of the text. The proverbial saying "eqai umað viter' supports the above argument. Hence the style is not the criterion for fixing the authorship. 
3. The expressions, like fa cited by the commentators Sridhara and others, while commenting on the very first verse of the Bhagavata, apply to the Devibhāgavata and do not refer to the Vişņubhāgavata. The Devibhāgavata narrates a story that Visnu became Hayagriva, when his head was cut off. The purpose of Hayagriva incarnation is only to uplift Srividyā. Hence Hayagrivabrahmavidyä means Śrividya, which was taught by Hayagriva. This definition is accepted by Sastras and tradition. This reference is found in the Devibhagavata only. Hence the Devibhāgavata was composed by Vedavyäsa and the Visnubhāgavata by some later poet. 
The above argument that the expressions like Hayagrivabrahmavidyå have refernce to the Devibhāgavata only and that all the texts taught by Hayagriva to Agastya, are called Brahmavidya, is not sound. To obtain the required meaning, the compound word danas is to be dissolved in several ways. The dissolution as giàu din argia is wrong, because the Vedas are not written by any human hand and that is why they are called apauruşeyas. Hence they are not sim, being self-revealed, they are called author-less. Even the second dissolution a farm is also irrelevant, since 
being the teacher feral is to be 
for this vidya, there could be no other teacher to him. The third dissolution as a resorted to, which means the Brahmavidya is uplifted by Hayagriva. The word बीवब्रह्मविद्या may mean either वेद or तत्त्व or तपस् or ब्रह्म or ब्राह्मण as per the lexicon, but it never signifies 
* Here क्लेश एवं शिष्यते is a misprint and it must be क्लेशल एवं शिष्यते । 
in the compound 
VI 
श्रीविद्या। To arrive at the required sense one has to resort to some other dissolution as ब्रह्मणः पत्नी (स्त्री) बाह्यी सरस्वती (श्री) तस्याः विद्या । It may seem to yield the required sense, since ब्राह्यो विद्या may be taken as signifying siren or taffan But the grammar does not approve of the formation. The word of masculine gender will have to take the form of feminine gender, when it is intended to mean the wife of , as a, or HRÁ or ब्रह्माणी | Then the compound must be ब्राह्मविद्या or ब्राह्मणीविद्या or ब्रह्माणोविद्या since there is no possibility of getting jam, i.e. the restoration of the masculine form in the place of the feminine. Hence the attempt to show all to mean will bear no fruit. Moreover, the ideas expressed in the verses 
YEM et cetera of Garuḍapurāņa will not apply to the Devibhagavata as they are applicable only in the case of the Vişņubhāgavata. 
4. Vyasa had made orderly arrangement of all the Vedas, which were in disorder till then and taught them to his disciples. Then he composed eighteen Puranas to expound the essence of the Vedas. After completing the Purāņas he composed the Mahabharata. Thereafter he produced the Viṣṇubhāgavata. Hence it can decidedly be said that the Bhāgavatapurāņa is a later text. When it is so, how can Viṣṇubhāgavata be included in the eighteen Purāṇas? Therefore the Devibhagavata only is to be included in the list, and thus the authority of the Viṣṇubhāgavata is questioned. 
The above statement, prompted by jealousy, cuts no ice. All the ancient texts such as the Śṛti, Smṛti, Itihāsa and Purāņa are treated as having no beginning. Owing to the adversities of time, many texts of old were almost ruined. Then Nārāyaṇa being born as Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana, arranged in proper order not only the Vedas but also the Purāņas. Many scholars hold that Vedavyāsa is not the author of all the Purânas, but he compiled, edited and arranged them in order. In the light of the above interpretation the word in the half- verse " अष्टादशपुराणानां कर्ता सत्यवतीसुतः " should mean संस्कर्ता ie the editor but not author. The compilation and edition et cetera of the Puranas cannot be said to have been done in a preferential or chronological order This must have taken place almost in a specific limited time. It is argued on all hands, that his Bhāgavata occupies a distinguished place among the Purăņas, which can be inferred from the story narrated in the opening cantos of the Bhāgavatapurāņa. Sage Vyêsa composed the Bhagavata, intending to substantiate the subject matter of the Upanisads, and to elevate his own self. He taught the Purana to his son Suka who in turn taught it to the king Parikṣit, desirous of obtaining salvation. În fine, Vyăsa is the author of the Bhāgavata and he is only a compiler cum propagator in the case of other Purāņas.* 
The long and short of the above arguments and counter arguments is that the Viṣnubhāgavata was composed by Vyāsa and it must be included in the eighteen Puräņas. The praise found in Garuḍapurāṇa and others applies to the Visnubhāgavata only. 
There is also another contradictory view with regard to the authorship of the above text, that the Bhāgavata is composed by Suka and not by Vyasa. A half verse "अम्बरीष शुक्रप्रोक्तं शृणु भागवत सदा" which occurs in the Padmapurāņa, is cited in support. In fact, there are several internal evidences in the Bhagavata itself to prove that the Bhagavata is, beyond all doubts, the work of Vyasa. In the Bhagavata it is expressly stated that it was composed by Vyasa and Suka learnt it from his father which is revealed by Suka himself. Hence the word in the above verse must be taken to mean that the Bhāgavata was taught (not composed) by Šuka, after learning it from Vyasa, his father. The above verse quoted from the Padmapurāņa is to be construed in accordance with the similar verses of the Bhāgavatapurāṇa, the more authentic source. Here are some quotations to prove Vyasa's authorship " उनमश्लोकचरितं चकार भगवानृषि" ( भाग 1-3-40) "निश्रेयमाय लोकस्य व स्वस्त्ययन महत् । तदिदं ग्राहयामास सुत मात्मविदा वरम" ( भाग 1-3-41), "अनर्थोपशम साक्षात् भक्तियोग मधोक्षजे लोकस्याजानां विद्वा agganzizam" (2m 1-7-6). From the above citations it can safely be decided that the author was Vyasa and he taught the text to his son. The following verses as Šuka's statement tell us undoubtedly that Suka learnt

the Bhāgavata from his father - "इदं भागवतं नाम पुराणं ब्रह्मसम्मितम्। अधीतवान् द्वापरादौ पितु द्वैपायनादहम् ।" (भाग, 2-1-8), "वेदगुप्तो मुनिः कृष्णो यतोऽह मिद मध्यगाम् । हित्वा स्वशिष्यान् पैलादीन् भगवान् बादरायणः ' ( भाग, 9-22-22), "महां पुत्ताय शान्ताय परं गुहा मिदं " (PT 9-22-23) and so on. From the above references it is understood that Vyasa himself composed the Bhagavata and taught the same to his son. 
PRINTED TEXTS CONSULTED FOR THE PREPARATION OF THIS EDITION

Excepting the editions of Gita Press Gorakhpur and Nirnayasagar Press, all the other editions give almost all the versions and variants of the Bhagavata text since they are provided with Sanskrit commentaries of various scholars holding different schools of thought on the Srimad Bhagavata. Besides, many of the commentators were also good editiors and they suggested many variants. 
Editions Nos. 1,2,3,7 and 8 generally agree on the text proper which indicates that they followed one particular recension. Nos, 4 and 6 represent another version; while Nos. 5 and 9 are suggestive of two distinct versions. No. 9 contains some additional verses that are not found in other editions and the number of verses in each chapter of every Skandha widely differs when compared with that in the other editions; but the total number being almost the same. The number of the Slokapādas also is not consistently of the same order and it differs from edition, to edition which necessarily results in difference of the total number of verses of each chapter. 
But, considering all the above points we may now broadly classify all the above ten editions into the following three groups: 
(A) Nos. 1,2,3,7 and 8 
(B) Nos. 4,5 and 6 
(C) Nos. 9 and 10 
MODUS OPERANDI 
The following principles are adopted for noting down the variants and additional verses: 
1. The text in Edition No. 1 forms the Basis. 
2. The variants found in other editions with reference to the basis are recorded with names of the 
editions. 
3. The variants suggested by the commentators are noted as indicated by them. 
4. The variants which are indicated in the foot-notes of a particular edition and which are not found in any text or commentary of any other edition, are noted here that they are found in a particular edition. 
5. The variants, though noted in the foot-notes of a particular edition or editions, are not recorded in 
our edition if they are found in any text or commentary of any other edition.

Ex 
6. Additional Verses found in any edition are recorded by denoting the number of the preceding and proceeding verses between which the additional verses are placed. These additional verses found in only one version are not given serial numbers treating them to be interpolations. 
7. Omissions of a letter or a word in any edition or editions are recorded with reference to the basis. 8. Pratikas are supplied by us to the commentary of Śridhara wherever they are found missing, keeping the style of Sridhara, the commentator, in mind, since we find pratika cited, to the majority of verses, at the beginning of the commentary. 
9. The slight change, in the order of words, occurring in the verses of different editions, such as यबिभेति स्वय भयम् and यद्विधेति भयं स्वयम् is ignored and not noted in the foot note, because the sense remains the same in either order. 
The idea in adopting the above principles is that, the variants or additional verses or omissions found in all the above 10 editions are to be carefully recorded in this edition for the convenience of the readers to understand the spirit and purport of the original text of the Srimad Bhagavata. 
COMMENTARIES 
The following commentaries are referred to - 
1. Bhāvärthadipika of Sridharasvāmi. 
2. Bhävärthadipikaprakāśa of Sri Vamsidhara on Bhāvārthadipikā. 
3. Dipani of Rādhāramaṇa Gosvāmi. 
4. Bhagavatacandracandrika of Sri Virarāghavācārya. 
5. Padaratnavali of Śri Vijayadhvaja. 
6. Kramasandarbha of Sri Jivagosvàmì. 
7 Särärthadarsini of Śrī Višvanathacakravarti. 
8. Siddhäntapradipa of Śri Šukadeva. 
9. Subodhini of Sri Vallabhācārya. 
10. Subodhiniprakasa of Śri Purusottama Carana Gosvāmi on Subodhini. 
Due to the popularity of Sri Bhāgavata Purāṇa, many learned scholars belonging to different Vedantic Schools, tried their hands at writing commentaries on the Bhagavata, in keeping with their tradition and philosophy. In this way they endeavoured to establish their own faith in a particular school of thought, taking full support from the Bhagavata. The popularity of the Bhagavata was so great that a great number of annotators have enriched their philosophy by these commentaries. 
A great many commentaries are there on the Bhagavata. But we have taken only three famous commentaries belonging to the Advaita, Visiṣṭādvaîta and Dvaita schools of Vedanta. 
1. Śridharasvāmi is the earliest of all. He belongs to Sankara's Advaita Philosophy. He says that he wrote his commentary. Bhāvārthadipikā by name in strict adherence to the old tradition and followed the foot steps of Citsukhācārya. His commentary is lucid though brief, authoritative though reticent and direct to the point, and that is why most of the commentators have made use of this enlightening exegesis. Näbhādāsji (Ref. Bhaktamāla - Chappaya 440) recorded a legend wherein it was stated that Lord Bindumadhava of Vārāṇasi has recognised Sridhara's commentary as the authoritative interpretation of Śri Bhagavata. The commentators of the other schools also have paid him glorious tributes, and they have incorporated some important points from 'Sridhara's commentary, in their commentaries. Some commentators frankly, admitted that they have annotated the Bhagavata only to elucidate the ideas of Sridhara. Jivagosvami observes in his introductory verse that his commentary was intended to elucidate the commentary of Sridhara, where it was felt somewhat difficult to understand, and make it clear where it was otherwise. The facts mentioned above go a long way to assess the real worth of Sridhara's gloss. Śridhararefers to Bopadeva of the thirteenth century and is referred to by writers like Vişņupuri*. So it can be inferred that he flourished in the middle of the 14th century. 
2. Śri Virarāghavācārya is a representative of the Višişṭädvaita school. He wrote a commentary on the Bhagavata. He rightly named his gloss the Candrika, for, this commentary is as pleasing as Candrika, or the moon-light, and throws much light on the text. It is an elaborate commentary supplying all the information required. He cited a great number of references in support of his view point. His knowledge of $ästras is vast and his erudition very deep. His explanations supported by diverse Sastras are exceptionally good. It is believed that he belongs to the fourteenth century. He was the son of“ Šrisaila of Vatsagotra. 
3. Śri Vijayadhvaja Tirtha is another able commentator on the Bhagavata. He belongs to the Dvaita School. His commentary is called Padaratnavali. He very closely follows the Bhāgavatatätparyanirnaya of Ananda Tirtha, which is only a que, giving elaborate elucidation wherever it is felt absolutely necessary. The Padaratnavali abounds in novel explanations and unique etymological derivations depending on Grammar and other Šastras. The text of the Bhāgavatapuraṇa taken up by Śri Vijayadhvaja records vast number of different readings, and alters the total number and the order of verses as well as the adhyāyas. He is supposed to have lived in the 15th century, A. D. 
4. There is another latest commentary, the Sudhisudhä written by Dr. P. Radhakrishna Sarma, the Director of the present project. The object of writing this commentary is to elucidate certain matters which need easier explanation. It caters for the needs of the present readers. The commentator tries to bring some modern thoughts to lime light offering new interpretation on certain topics. His explanation is chiefly meant for making the text easily understood. The deep study of the Bhāgavata Rahasyaprakāśa of Kulapati Dr. Sri Ekkirala Krishnamacharya propelled him to write this commentary taking the important points into its fold. 
*Ref. to Puranavimarśa pp. 572-73 by Baladeva Upadhyaya. 
*Here in this context we wish to write a few words to clear a doubt that may be created by a wrong interpretation of two 
slokas of the introductory verses of his commentary The slokas run thus - 
"arè anggy zdzerdazu arctcgani fafu 
श्रीशैलैशगुरु श्रियः पतिमपि प्राचार्यपारम्परीम् । " ॥ १॥ 
" श्रीशैलपूर्णा दखिलेतिहासपुराणजाल समवाप्य येन 
प्रावर्ति सन्दर्शयतेव शिष्यभाव मुनि लक्ष्मण माश्रयेऽहम्। " ॥ २ ॥ 
Referring to the above slokas it is stated as "He was the son of Srisaila of Vatsagotra and a pupil of Laksmanamuni, his father's disciple Of course, Sri Viraraghavacārya was the son of Srisaila or Śrīsaileśa, but he was not the disciple of Laksmanamuni, and Laksmanamuni was not the disciple of the present commentator's father Therefore the above interpretation is not correct Laksmanamuni means here Ramanujacarya who belongs to the 11th century and Viraraghava to the 14th century. The relationship of the teacher and the taught can not exist between the above two on account of the wide gap of time The above verses are to be rendered thus "My obeisance to my father Srisailesa by name, who is the son of Ahobalacarya, the ocean of the waters of Vatsalya, the compassion My obeisance to the consort of Laksmidevi, (ie Visnu) and to the successive line of preceptors surrender unto Laksmanamuni se Sriramanujācārya who behaved as a disciple towards Srisailapurna, having learnt all the Itchāsas and Puranas from him." 
Here in the above šioka Śrīšailesa is the name of the father of the commentator here means father (please refer to the Colophon श्रीशैलेशगुरो स्सुतेन etc) श्रीशैलपूर्ण mentioned in the next verse is not identical with श्रीशैलशगुरु । श्रीशेलपूर्ण is a Sanskritised form of Tirumalainambi He is quite a different person He was the uncle, and preceptor of Rámánujǎcarya, the author of the Sribhasya etc and he taught the Ramayana and the Puranas to Ramanuja The misunderstanding is due to the confusion in the meaning of the two words, श्रीशैलेशगुरु and श्रीशैलपूर्ण । लक्ष्मण signifies Ramanuja and muni means Sahnyasın. As such Laksmanamuni means Ramanujācharya, a Samnyasın. The above interpretation may be verified by looking into the second sloka wherein a successive line of the disciples from Ramanuja is stated

APPENDICES 
Appendix 1: We have printed quarter-verse index arranging it in the alphabetical order. Though the task is strenuous and monotonous we have prepared it for the convenience of the scholars. Any quotation, from the Bhāgavata, let it be full or half or quarter verse, occurring in any book under study can be found here in the index and its position can be known easily. 
Appendix 2: In this appendix we have enlisted the quotations occurring in all the commentaries. The commentators who are versatile scholars cite the passages profusely right from the Vedas to the contemporary works either with a view to elucidating the text or to substantiating their explanations or to inculcating the Philosophy more effectively, or to infusing the spiritual consciousness into the hearts of the readers or to kindling the Bhakti or devotion in the votaries towards the God. It was aimed at tracing the sources of the quotations. The number of quotations being prodigious, source tracing proved to be an onerous task. But we have ventured to embark on this new enterprise, bearing in mind the oft-quoted saying- "अध्यप्रसिद्धं यशसे हि पुंसा मनन्यसाधारण मेव कर्म", which has served as an impetus in this respect. The quotations culled from the first skandha itself are 679. Despite our endeavour, we could not trace the sources of all the quotations. However, we have succeeded in tracing more than eighty per cent sources. But at some places we could not mention the subdivisions, i.e. Adhyāya, Sarga, Parva, Śloka et cetera. Hence we have given only the name of the text of very voluminous works such as the Skânda, where tracing is almost impossible. 
It is hoped that the readers are enabled to refer to the original source-texts and benefitted by obtaining more information. We have noted, in brackets the name of the source-text and the numbers of the subdivision of the texts, immediately after the respective quotations, in the text of the commentary itself. Not content with this act, we have prepared separately a list of quotations along with the name of the sources et cetera, and arranged them in the alphabetical order and added the same to the text as appendix-2. 
EDITING 
1. A correction has been made with regard to a word visvien occurring in a sloka commencing with 'ange died 144' (1-3-1). The commentary of Viraraghava pertaining to the verse according to A-edition runs as "एकादशेन्द्रियपञ्चभूतात्मकः षोडशकलाः यस्मिंस्तथा " The word pañcabhūtātmaka is an adjective to the word कलाः । Hence the adjective should agree with its noun in gender and number. is of feminine gender in plural number. als: is of masculine gender in singular number. Now the antagonism between the noun and the adjective is apparent. Hence it is ungrammatical. The W-edition gives here somewhat better reading as 
gan: In this version the disagreement of number is avoided. But the adjective being of feminine gender, its form should be "af" We have amended so, keeping in mind the aphorism of Pāņini "प्रत्ययस्थात्कारपूर्वस्यातइदाप्यसुपः” (अष्टा. 7-3-44). 
2. A line "प्रत्ययस्येति शब्दस्य योऽर्थः स तद्वा इति तच्छब्देन परामृश्यते" is found in the commentary of Virarāghava on the second verse in the third canto, în A-edition. The sentence, as it is, can not be construed properly. The word Я is not found in the text, with which some other word is intended to be construed. W-edition 
reads it correctly as "प्रथमस्य यस्य इति शब्दस्य योऽर्थः "We adopted this version. Now it means, that the word यस्य occurs twice, in the consecutive slokas यस्याम्पसि..... and यस्यावयव..... There the first यस्य is to be construed with तत् in तद्वै in accordance with the convention यत्तदो र्नित्यसम्बन्धः; यस्य is referred to by तत् । 
2. (a) The commentary of Viraraghava, acording to A-edition on the above sloka runs thus- " रूपस्य ज्ञानदृश्य मपरिच्छेद्यत्वं सर्वावतारनिदानत्वश्चाऽऽह यस्याम्भसीति सार्थेन। Here अपरिच्छेद्यत्व and सर्वावतारनिदानत्व are abstract nouns where as the first word ng is, unlike the other words, an adjective. This also must be an abstract 
Ки 
noun to suit the sense as stated in W-edition. This is amended accordingly. Further, in lieu of A-edition's reading यस्याम्पसीति सार्धेन the reading पश्यन्तीति सार्धेन is found in W-edition. In view of the sense the reading of W-edition is correct. So we have adopted the reading of W-edition. 
3. A portion of the commentary of Viraraghava on the eighth sioka of third adhyaya, as per A-edition reads thus --- "य स्तन्नात् कर्मणां निवृत्तिधर्मवतां नैष्कर्म्य निवृत्तिधर्मविरहं प्रवृत्तिधर्माणां अकर्तव्यताऽवगम्यते । The word नैष्कार्य is explained by the word निवृत्तिधर्मविरह नैष्कर्म्य is निवृत्तिधर्म but not निवृत्तिधर्मविरह, which is quite contrary. So प्रवृत्तिधर्म is adopted by us, as seen in the W-editon. Further, निवृत्तिधर्मविरहं अवगम्यते is wrong usage. Since the verb अवगम्यते is in the passive voice the object of the verb ie, प्रवृत्तिधर्मविरह must be in nominative case as विरहः, and not in the objective case as far So the reading : is taken by us. 
4. The commentary of 
on the thirty first verse in the same adhyāya reads 
"स्वरूपावरणेन तदध्यासत इवि सदृष्टान्त माह" as per A edition. The word अध्यासते is replaced by अध्यासः, a reading found in H and Veditions. As the verbal form will not serve the purpose, the word as the noun form, suited to the context, 
is adopted. 
5. We had to change the order of the slokārdhas of the 43rd, 44th and 45th slokas in the third adhyāya. It was done quite în consonance with the propriety of sense and the spirit of the commentaries. 
The order of the ślokardhas as

The above verses are three in number and so there are six half verses. With regard to the first half there is no change. But the fourth half as printed in A-edition is changed as the second half, the fifth as the third half, the sixth half as the fourth half, the second half as the fifth half, and the third half as the sixth half in this edition. As a result of the above adoption some changes have been effected in the position of Sridhara's commentary also.

The reading त्रैवर्णिकादित्वात् as per A edition occurring in the commentary of Virarāghava on the 25th sloka of the 4th adhyaya, is replaced by त्रैवर्णिकाधिकारित्वात्, as the propriety of the reading उपनयनस्थ त्रैवर्णिकाधिकारित्वात् and the impropriety of the reading उपनयनस्य त्रैवर्णिकादित्वात् are obvious. 
7. "पद गतौ, गत्यर्था मुख्यर्थाः उपबृंहितं येन तदिति वा" is a line seen in the commentary of Viraraghava on the 3rd verse of the 5th adhyaya, as per A-edition. The sentence appears to be mutilated one. But W-edition gives us a meaningful reading as "पद गती, गत्यर्था बुद्ध्यर्थाः यत् यस्मात् सवर्थः परिबृंहितं सर्वार्थाः परिबृंहिता येन तदिति वा" | So this reading is adopted. 
8. "अमोघ मवितथं पश्यतीति तथाभूतहिताचरणाय बद्धदीक्षा इत्यर्थः" | Only this much is seen in the commentary of Virarāghava on the 13th verse of the same adhyaya as per A edition. The above reading, as it is, makes no sense. That is why we have adopted here the lengthier reading, found in W-edition, that makes the sense full, as भूतहिताचरणोपयुक्तज्ञानसम्पन्नश्चेत्यर्थः । न केवल ममोघदृगेव, अपि तु घृतवतः घृतं सङ्कल्पितं व्रतं सत्यदीक्षारूपं येन सः भूतहिताचरणाय 
दक्ष इत्यर्थः । 
xiii 
A sentence in the same place is found in all editions as "a ùa và vả mà!”" By studying the commentary, it was thought that this requires a slight change to give better meaning. So we have suggested "कथ मेवं महाभाग्यम् ?" in lieu of "कथ मेव महो भाग्यम् !" 
9. The 24th verse of the sixth adhyāya begins with "niam didien à”: This phrase allows two kinds of splitting सत्सेवया दीर्घया and सत्सेवया अदीर्घया | Both these versions were printed and commented in both the ways by different authors. But the majority of the commentators accepted the splitting as add and commented accordingly. Therefore accepting the splitting as are, we have printed the text as सत्सेवया दीर्घया with अकारप्रश्लेष to suit the purpose. 
10. The word 
occurring in 28th sloka of the 6th adhyaya, has been printed as flafuri (A,B,K & M). This form being erroneous we have accepted the form an agreeable to grammar, means lightning. The word is to be derived thus is the stem; the suffix is added to this as per the aphorism of Panini "" (3. 4-3-112) in the sense that the lightning exists in the same quarter (दिक् ) in which the mountain सुदामा exists. Because of the affix अणु the stem gets the suffix ोपू i.e. ई । सुदामा may mean also the white coloured elephant of Indra i.e. Airävata as per the definition of Trikändaseṣa as fyer Hence means the lightning which has the same substratum along with the Airavata. Here again after applying the aphorism at the aphorism "a" (1-4-167) which ordains far is to be applied to ward off the far etc., lest it should get the unwanted form as on the analogy of etc. सौदामिनी is, of course, ungrammatical, Medinikosadefines " सुदामा तु पुमान् वारिधरपर्वतभेदयोः " i.e. सुदामा signifies not only a mountain but also the cloud. So in the sense ga that which arises in the cloud, is damit i Having studied the subject in this light we had to effect two corrections in A-edition following the W-edition. नान्तत्वात् has been replaced by अण्णन्तत्वात् and सौदामनी इत्यपि पाठः by सौदामिनी इत्यपपाठ । 
11. A reading in the commentary of Viraraghava in A-edition on the 37th sloka of the same adhyaya runs "ata and ram fed:" This line is unintelligible. But the reading in the same place of W-edition is 
found as "आख्यातमेव सङ्गृह्य दर्शयति 
मे मम जन्मकर्मणोः रहस्यं तथा भवतः तव आत्मा मन तुष्यते येन तच्च तत्सर्व माख्यात मित्यर्थः । This reading, being complete and meaningful, is taken to our edition. 
12. (a) The reading gugan in the commentary of Viraraghava on the 10th verse of the 7th adhyaya, in A-edition is changed as 
since the word is to be split, as a 
the adjective of the noun : This is done following W-edition. 
because it is 
(b) In the commentary of Vijayadhvaja on the same verse, the reading as per the A-edition is found as "ef goalfa fai aukit" This is defective as some words are lost. But B.K and M-editions present the supply of all the meaningful words needed. So the version "आनन्दरूपा भक्तिं कुर्वन्ति, किंपुन बहुजन्म स्वपरीक्षित परतस्वा ये भक्तयादिसाधनातिशयेन मुक्ता वानन्दातिशयमाकाङ्क्षमाणाः शुकादयः उरुक्रमे भक्तिं कुर्वन्तीति' is adopted in this edition. 13. (a) In the commentary of Viraraghava on the next verse ie. the 11th as per A-edition an erroneous line is found as - "नित्यं विष्णुजनप्रियः अहर्दिव माख्यानम्" is corrected as "नित्यं विष्णुजनप्रियः महदिदमाख्यानम् ' as per W-edition. 
(b) The version of the commentary of Viraraghava on the same verse seen as →→ 
“ufas aguadised कानुभाव्यत्वात् अवतारतदुणाना विशिष्य वेदान्तेभ्योऽवगतानाम् " is incorrect. Hence this is corrected in the light of the version of W-edition as "सभक्ति तद्णस्यैव भगवतोऽनुभाव्यत्वात् अवतारतणभक्ततगुणानां विशिष्य वेदान्तेभ्योऽनवगतानाम् ” । 
14. The 30th verse in the eighth adhyaya. Here the commentary of Viraraghava as per A and B-editions is - "किन्त्वदर्शना ऋष्यादिनाम्रा तापसादिरूपेण वा अन्विता इत्यर्थः " The reading adopted in this edition as per W-edition is - "a apliga aaften, amenfesturentiem "This change is done for easy understanding. 
XIV 
as -- 
15. The 16th verse of the 9th adhyaya. The commentary of Viraraghava as per A and B-editions runs ciaofa sig az emiferida:"! Finding that this commentary can not be construed properly, the reading is replaced by → "स लोकोऽपि श्रीकृष्णायत्त सत्तादिमांश्चेत्" as found in W-edition. 
37 

16. in the commentary of Vijayadhvaja on the 41st śloka (9th Adhyāya) beginning with 
"युधि तुरंग we have made an amendment to suit the purpose. While eulogising Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Bhisma uses an adjective विलसत्कवचे to Srikrsna and it has been commented as विलसत् शोभमान कवचं यस्य तस्मिन् 1.e in him who has put on a splendid armour. Again he gives another interpretation to the same word as facuą od 317 ad gaarid at means, in him who has a bright snake, Ananta () for his couch. The word विलसन् is explained by सर्पोऽनन्तः । But it is quite irrelevant, since विलसन् can not mean अनन्तसर्प। So it requires an amendment to get suited sense, Following the convention वबयो रभेदः, वकार can be changed to बकार and सन् is to be corrected as सत्, when the form is बिलसत् । Now the word can be dissolved as बिले सीदतीति बिलसत् that which dwells in a hole of the earth, i.e. a serpent: So face means that far takes as his bed. Here we remind some citations to the readers from lexicon, in support —— "दन्दशूको बिलेशय" ( अम को, 2-28), "मूषिकेऽहौ बिलेशयः" (वैज. को. 8-5-18) and "खिलौका गूढपा च्चक्री" (वैज. को 4-1-6). 
17. The serial number of the stanzas of the 11th 3 from the 18th to the 25th is different from one edition to another. The order of the serial number is changed keeping in mind the propriety of the meaning of the verses. The line "qofta agdaraa:" is found in the commentary of Śridhara which means the subjects denoted by the words Vāsudeva et cetera, existing in the 16th verse are to be construed with the verb :, that exists in the fourth verse from the 16th verse. The fourth stanza from the 16th will be the 19th. But the verb weg is in the second half of the eighteenth verse in A-edition. So this verse can not be the 19th from the 16th. But this is the first half of the 19th verse as per B,H and V-editions. According to the sense these three editions have been taken as authentic. The commentary of Śridhara is arranged in this order. The remaining commentaries are arranged in the order of the slokas which has been adopted in this edition. Pratika is also adjusted accordingly. 
18. (a) The reading of the commentary of Viraraghava on the 19th verse in the 12th adhyaya is found as-" her famarandaga Targafia" as per A-edition. But the same is found in W-edtion as a मनितरसाधारणैकगुण मेक मेवानुवर्तिता" | Being better the latter reading is adopted. 
(b) in the same place the commentary of Viraraghava runs as, “ð qan yu genfis:" as per A-edtion. But is irrelevant in the context, and so this word is replaced by afa a relevant word from W-edition. 
19. The commentary of Viraraghava on the 5th verse in the 13th adhyaya is missing in A-edition. So the commentary found in the B and W-editions is inserted in this edition at the proper place. 
20. The commentary of Śridhara as per A-edition on the 9th verse of the 14th adhyaya reads ung This, being irrelevant, has been given up. The reading of B,H and V-editions as yang has been adopted. 
21. Some portion of the commentary of Viraraghava on the 35th verse of the 15th Adhyāya is missing as per A-edition, where only this much as "an aquaene am" is found. The defect here is rectified by following the reading of the W-edition which runs as follows: 
"स्वेन रूपेणैवावतिष्ठते । tren a भगवा नपि तत्प्रयोजनाय मत्स्यादिरूपाणि यावत्प्रयोजनं धते । तदन्ते पुनर्जात्। हित्वा स्वकीयरूपेणैवावतस्थे । तथा तेन 
XV22. The 24th verse in the 16th adhyāya. In the commentary of the above verse a portion is printed as RR! The word bhara is against the metric rule. So R is corrected as in all the commentaries according to the मूलश्लोक | 
23. The 13th verse in the 18th adhyaya. A line in the commentary of Vijayadhvaja reads as per A-edition as facetterer of: But it is replaced here by face of, a better version of B, K and M-editions. 
24. The 44th verse in the same adhyaya. There occurs a phrase in the commentary of Vijayadhvaja which explains that a fer is the root for i This is as per A-edition. But in some other edition, it is explained that, ferm is the root for * The latter derivation is preferred to the former.

To express gratitude to those who have helped is the ardent duty of every one. Accordingly at the outset, I would offer my heartiest thanks to Sri P. V. R. K. Prasad, 1. A S, the then Executive Officer, T. T. Devasthanams, but for whose untiring efforts this institute, viz. S. V.

Lastly I offer my heartiest thanks to all who have helped me in preparing and bringing out this volume of Śrimad Bhagavata. 
I will be failing in my sacred duty, if I forget to thank the generous gentlemen, who have furnished the project with their rare and valuable editions of Śrimadbhāgavata.

Hanumaiah, Guntur and Sri Rachakonda Narasimha Murthy, Jillellamudi, Guntur dt., A.P. 
Now the first volume of Srimad Bhagavata, a critical edition, with the four commentaries is presented to the readers. This being my debut on this line, some mistakes must have crept in, for which we crave the indulgence of the readers. The concrete suggestions regarding the improvement of the edition will be received with pleasure and gratitude. I think that my labours will be amply rewarded if this edition can serve the purpose of the readers and scholars

समाधानम् नैत धुज्यते । श्रुतिस्मृतीतिहास पुराणादि सकलसदन्याः अनादिसिद्धाः । कालवैषम्येण उत्सन्नेषु प्राचीनप्रबन्धेषु नारायण एवं कृष्णद्वैपायनरूपेणावतीर्य, वेदव्यास इति अन्वर्थनामा भूत्वा यथा वेदान् तथा पुराणादी न्यपि उद्धृत्य संस्कृत्य प्रकट्यकरोत् । वस्तुतः पुराणानां सर्वेषामपि विषये व्यासस्य संस्कर्तृत्व मेव नतु कर्तृत्व मिति विदुषा मभिप्रायः । “अष्टादशपुराणानां कर्ता सत्यवतीसुतः" इत्यत्र श्लोके कर्तृशब्दः संस्कर्तृबोधक एवेति निश्चीयते विपश्चिद्भिः । अतः पुराणानां पौर्वापर्य सहेतु निर्णेतुं न शक्यते । सर्वेषां पुराणानां परिष्करणं एककाल आसी दिति निर्णीयते । परन्तु सर्वपुराणवैलक्षण्य मस्य भागवतस्य सर्वैरभ्युपेयते । भागवतावतारकथापरिशीलनेन एतत् सिध्यति । भगवान् व्यासः सर्वपुराणोत्कृष्टं सकलोपनिषत्प्रतिपाद्यार्थोपबृंहकत्वेन श्रीमद्भागवत- मात्मोद्धरणाय स्वय मेव विरचय्य स्वपुत्ताय शुकयोगिने समुपादिशत् स च परीक्षिते मुमुक्षवे इति । ततः क्रमशोऽस्य प्रचारः । ब्राह्मादीनां प्रवक्तार स्त्वन्ये, प्रचारको व्यासः । अपि तु भागवतपुराणस्य प्रवक्ता स्वयमेव व्यास इति विवेकः । 

एतावतो ग्रन्थस्य सङ्गृहीतं तात्पर्यमेतत् - इदं भागवतं व्यासप्रणीत मेव इद मेव अष्टादशपुराणान्तर्गतम् ; गारुडादिपुराणप्रशंसापात्र मपि इद मेव भागवतम् इति च * । 
एतदृन्थकर्तृत्वविषये अपरे केचि दन्यथा आशेरते । “अम्बरीष शुकप्रोक्तं शृणु भागवतं सदा" इति पाद्यपुराणस्थं अम्बरीषं प्रति गौतमेनोक्तं वचन माधारीकृत्य भागवतं शुकप्रोक्तं शुककर्तृक मिति व्याख्यान्ति । वस्तुतस्तु शुकप्रोक्त मित्यस्य व्यासात्पितु रधीत्य स्वमुखेन पुनः कथित मित्यर्थः । शुकप्रोक्तं इतीदं पदं पाद्मपुराणस्थम् । अत्रैव भागवते भागवतं व्यासमुनिप्रोक्त मित्यस्य बहूनि प्रमाणानि सन्ति । " उत्तमश्लोकचरितं चकार भगवानृषिः " ( भाग 1-3-40), "निःश्रेयसाय लोकस्य धर्म्य स्वस्त्ययनं महत्, तदिदं ग्राहयामास सुत मात्मविदां वरम्" (भाग 1-3-41, 42), "अनर्थोपशमं साक्षा द्भक्तियोग मधोक्षजे । लोकस्याजानतो विद्वां चक्रे सात्त्वतसंहिताम् " ( भाग. 1-7-6 ) इत्येभिर्वचनैः भागवतस्य व्यासकर्तृकत्वं सुतायोपदिष्टत्वश्च स्फुटं प्रतिपादिते । "इदं भागवतं नाम पुराणं ब्रह्मसम्मितम्। अधीतवान् द्वापरादौ पितु द्वैपायना दहम्” ( भाग. 2-1-8) " वेदगुप्तो मुनिः कृष्णो यतोऽहमिद मध्यगाम् । हित्वा स्वशिष्यान् पैलादीन् भगवान् बादरायणिः" ( भाग. 9-22-22), "मह्यं पुत्ताय शान्ताय परं गुह्य मिदं जगौ" 
( भाग. 9-22-23 ) इति श्रीशुकेनैवोक्तत्वात् व्यासो विरचय्य पुत्तायोपदिदेशेति स्पष्टमवगम्यते । अतोऽत्र शुककर्तृकत्वशङ्का परास्ता ।
