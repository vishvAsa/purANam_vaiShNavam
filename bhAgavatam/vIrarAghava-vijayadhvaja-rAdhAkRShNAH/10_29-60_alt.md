FOREWORD 
Sri Bhagavata critical edition project is one of the important projects being taken up by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. Sri Bhāgavata occupies a unique place in the spiritual literature of the world containing as it does the quintessence of devotion, knowledge and spirituality. It takes us to higher realms of thought and 
enriches our world-view. 
Sri Bhāgavata purāņa is an indispensable text for those who are interested in Indian culture, philosophy and religion. When the great seer-composer Vedavyāsa was in a depressed, gloomy mood, the celestial, sage Narada has advised him to write this epic with the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the central figure. It has that magical touch of the great composer who not only captures the subtle nuances of the Lord's life but also brings to the narrative a unique devotional, sublime flavour and fervour that entertains, ennobles and enthralls all. It has a message for everyone - young and old. 
The project aims at the preparation of a reference volume incorporating the three main commentaries drawn from the three dominant schools of philosophy - Advaita, Dvaita and Visiṣtādvaita. The present volume containing the second part of the tenth Skandha forms a part of the twelve - volume critical edition being edited by the eminent scholar Sri N.C.V. Narasimhacharyulu who has painstakingly prepared this edition by bringing in new insights with his vast experience and rare erudition. 
The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams humbly offers this Bhakti Bhāṣya, (as Śri Bhāgavata is called) to the discerning readers. Hopefully they would have the 
divine flavour of the nectar drawn from the veda. 
"Nigama Kalpataroḥ Galitam Phalam Sukamukhādamṛta drava samyutam 
Pibata Bhagavatam rasamālayam Muhuraho Rasikā Bhuvi Bhāvukāḥ” 
(Bhagavata - 1-1-3) 
(Drink deep the nectar flowing from the fruit of the Vedas as it trickles down from Sri Suka, the parrot, perched on the tree of wisdom.)

(I.V. SUBBARAO)INTRODUCTION 
It is well known to all that the munificent Management of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams is making strenuous incessant and sincere efforts for maintaining our Cultural Heritage enshrined in veritable Hindu Scriptures and other works akin to them. It strains every nerve, as it were, to sustain the Religio-philosophic outlook, wherein our Nations's peace and prosperity lie. In order to servive the Sanātana Dharma in the nation, to propagate and instil Bhakti in the minds of the people and making them pious, to convey the message of the Rṣis to mankind, to disseminate the ever-lasting, ever-fresh and inestimable greatness of Ārșa Dharma far and wide for the benefit of the sophisticated and unsophisticated people alike, the noble Devasthanam has founded many an institution such as Dharma Prachara Pariṣat, the Dāsasahitya project, the Alwar Divya Prabandha Project, the Recording Project and the Publication Cell. Further, the Management is sanctioning heavy amounts under the scheme of ‘Aid to Publish Religious Texts'. It is also financing the Paurāņikas, Veda Ghanapathys et cetera, the torch bearers of Indian Culture. It is generously granting financial aid to the numerous authors of Religious works in various languages. For the sake of upholding Arts and Fine Arts such as Music and Dance the Devasthanam is maintaining the educational institutions viz. the Arts Colleges, the College of Music and Dance, the Veda Pāṭhaśālas, the Oriental College and others. 
Śrī Bhāgavata Critical Edition Project is one among such institutions. When the unparalleled greatness of the sacred Śrī Bhāgavata is acknowledged, the value of the Project will be well realised. The Śrī Bhāgavata is a veritable encyclopedia of Spiritual Philosophy rendered in puraṇa form to make it more palatable, valuable, accessible and acceptable to literates as well as illiterates. It kindles in readers the unmotivated pure devotion towards the Supreme. 
Although there are eighteen puräṇas only the Bhāgavata puraṇa commands much reverence of the devotees. This purāna abounds in essential teachings to gain salvation and freedom from the worldly trials and tribulations. After the advent of this purāṇa all the other purāņas were relegated to the background. This purāņa is a devotional, philosophical, metaphisical and religious text rendered in a fine poetic form. Thus this text being wonderful and peculiar is extolled as a spiritual book Par Excellence. It has been worshipped as a deity placed on the golden throne. The pious people recite the puraṇa like the scripture of high order with much respect, since the daily recital of the text is sincerely believed to be capable of alleviating all sorts of human sufferings. Unlike all the other purāņas the Bhagavata is quoted by all the divergent and diverse sectarians as a genuine and authentic text to substantiate or to fortify their respective Dogmas, for, it has been accepted as an authority by the followers of all the schools of philosophy. 
Apart from its superb poetry and the very wide range of its devotional teachings, the reason for its forceful and ever expanding appeal lies in its elaborate exposion of the life and messages of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Out of eighteen thousand verses six thousand and odd verses deal with him directly. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is depicted as a perfect incarnation of Śrī Mahāviṣṇu. He is represented in the text as Saccidanandasvarupa Parabrahman, as described in the Upanisads and the Bhagavadgītā. He is projected herein as Supreme God. He is the perfect being amidst all the imperfect situations. The Eternal Boy, the paragon of the masculine beauty he always 
remains in his spiritual elevation, though he appears to be a pastoral boy intermingling with 
cowherd boys and other boys of lowest birth and station. This type of depiction of Lord in 
this text became most appealing and attracting even among lower classes. It is read by 
devotees with peity in raptures. 
ABOUT THE PURĀNAS 
Purāņa means old. It means "an old, ancient and sacred record" containing the whole 
body of Hindu mythology. But it is appropriately defined thus is though it belongs 
to the remote past it looks anew on account of its ever fresh value of the subject matter. Further, the word पुरा means both past and future. So purāna means पुरा = आगतानागतौ अणति nyufa zia gum, purāņa tells us about the past and future. Hence it can be termed as an 
ever-green book. The Vayu puraṇa defines thus- since the text tells about the past event it is called purāna and he, who knows the etymology, (fifth) will be liberated from sins. Like 
this there are also some other different definitions of the work. 
All the ancient texts such as the Śṛtis, Smṛtis and Purāņas are treated as having no beginning (31). They were not composed by human beings. Owing to the adversaries of 
time many texts of old were almost ruined. Even the surviving texts remained jumbled and 
utterly confused. the Lord Nārāyaṇa born as Kṛṣṇa dvaipayana, as believed by Indian 
tradition, arranged all the disorderly texts in a proper order, categorising, dividing and 
subdividing the Vedas. That is why he was called as Vedavyāsa (arranger of Vedas). Like 
the Vedas the purāņas also are authorless. They emanated, like the Vedas from the breath of the Omniscient Lord. Vyasa arranged the purāṇas also naming them as Padma, Skanda and so on. So the saying Nyaf adi ya: can properly be comprehended. The word af haf here means i.e. arranger in a scientific and proper order, but not the author. The puräņas are reckoned as eighteen, but the Kurmapuraṇa gives a list of eighteen Upapurāņas. 

III 
MODE OF EDITING AND PUBLISHING 
As said above Śrī Bhāgavata purāņa is an indispensable and invaluable book to them 
who are interested in the spiritual and devotional knowhow. But unfortunately this purāṇa critically and authentically edited and nicely printed is not available at present. Even a good edition of the work containing mere text (4) to enable the devotees to perform daily recital (414) is not available. The Management of T.T.D. knowing the dire necessity of the text, has taken up the problem seriously to tackle and consequently established the Śrī Bhāgavata Critical Edition Project in 1981 and constituted an Editorial Board. Ever since 
its inception the Project is trying to go ahead speedily. But it could not show speedy progress by leaps and bounds as thought of, but it goes by fits and starts owing to several reasons. 
SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE EDITION 
Though as many as eleven commentaries with text were printed by others long ago, they are not available now. We have taken only three commentaries belonging to the schools of Advaita, Visiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita which are completely true and faithful to the 
Scriptures. We have used several different editions to collate and corroborate. We have 
consulted all the available editions, taken the best readings after thorough study and comparison and prepared our edition. 
Having in view the benefit to the reader scholars I have prepared two types of appendices and added them arranged alphabetically at the end of the text. One is with the 
quarter verse index. This will facilitate the scholars to locate the citation from Sri Bhagavata occurring in any text they study with exact number of Skandha, Canto and verse. The other belongs to the alphabetical index of the citations given in the commentaries to substantiate the particular subject. The citations are numerous because the scholiasts are well versed in all the texts, the scriptures and others. The readers can know that the particular citation is from such and such text whether it be Sṛti, Smrti, Purāņa, Agama and the like. Then they can study the source text, with commentary if any, and understand fully well the spirit and purport of the citation. This is the special advantage of this index. 
After finishing the fourth skandha we took up the fifth skandha for editing. But at this juncture our Management ordered us to take up immediately the tenth skandha for editing, as this tenth skandha is directly connected with Śrī Kṛṣṇás life and history. This tenth skandha 
is considered to be the quintessence of the entire text because of its sacredness and importance. Obeying the orders of the Management we took the tenth skandha for editing, discontinuing fifth skandha in the middle. We have edited tenth skandha deviding it into 
IV 
three volumes and prepared the press copy. We have proposed to publish the entire Bhāgavata text in fourteen volumes. The nine skandhas go to make nine volumes. The tenth skandha being very large is split into three volumes as tenth, eleventh and twelfth volumes and 
eleventh and twelfth skandhas into two volumes as the thirteenth and fourteenth volumes 
(9+3+2=14). 
Later we took up for editing the semifinished fifth skandha. We completed fifth to nineth skandha (inclusive of both). The press copy was also prepared upto this. We are now going ahead with the editorial work of the eleventh skandha. After completing this work we shall take the twelfh i.e., the last skandha. When it is completed, the Bhāgavata will be of fourteen volumes. 
The first volume containing first skandha was published by TTD in the year 1989. The first part of the tenth skandha containing twenty eight cantos (1to 28) was released in the year 1998. The second part of the tenth skandha containing thrity two cantos (29 to 60) is released now. Third part containing thirty cantos (61 to 90) will be released in due course 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
It is my pleasant duty to express my sincere gratitude to those reputed and respected persons, who have generously helped me in getting this volume published. At the outset, I thank the Scholar Trio, viz. Dr. Ekkirala Krishnamacharyulu, Sri P.V.R.K. Prasad, I.A.S. the then Executive Officer and Dr. Pannala Radhakrishna Sarma, with whose strenuous and sincere efforts the Sri Bhāgavata Critical Edition Project was established in the year 1981. Thence forth this Project has been striving, at its best to publish the volumes of Sri Bhagavata one after the other. 
Every successive Executive Officer of T.T.D. is extending help with devotional zeal and enthusiasm for the furtherance of the Project. Every successor emulates his predecessor with regard to evincing interest in the sacred task. The successive list of the Executive Officers of TTD is as follows Sri P.V.R.K. Prasad, I.A.S. Sri G. Kumaraswamy Reddy, I.A.S. Sri S. Lakshminarayana, I.A.S. Sri Ch. Venkatapathy Raju, I.A.S. Sri M.V.S. Prasad, L.A.S. Sri D.V.L.N. Murthy, L.A.S. Sri N. Ramesh Kumar, I.A.S. and Sri M.K.R. Vinayak, I.A.S. I ardently thank them all for their unstinted help extended towards the said Project. Their help went a long way to carry on the research work connected with the editing of the Srimad Bhagavata. The present Executive Officer Dr. I.V. Subba Rao, I.A.S. is taking special care and interest and his help gives a stimulus to the Project work. As such I profoundly thank him. I also thank Sri D. Ramakrishnaiah, I.A.S. the Joint Executive Officer. I offer my heartfelt greatfulness to Avadhani sarvabhouma, Mahasahasravadhani 
V 
Dr. Medasani Mohan, the Director, Sri Annamacharya Project etc. for his uniform interest in the Project work. 
My thanks are due also to the learned Editorial Board of Śrī Bhāgavata Project for its valuable suggestions. I convey my deep gratefulness to the Chairman and the members of the TTD Trust Board and the members of the Specified Authority for kindly providing all the facilities to the Project.. 
I feel it is quite essential to express my deep debt of gratitude to the Research Assistants of the Śrī Bhāgavata Project viz. Sri J.C. Jayachandra Sastry, Siromani and Vidwan Sri A. Varadarajaņ, Siromani and Vidwan Sri U. Venkataramaiah, M.A. Siromani (all the three retired) and Dr. K. Rajagopalan, M.A., Ph.D. (who left the Project some time ago) Sri S.B.S. Bhattacharya, Siromani, Sikshasastri, Srimati S. Poornavalli, M.A. Gold Medalist, and Dr. S. Dasaratha, M.A., Ph.D. But for the assistance of the said research scholars I could not have accomplished this work. I must once again thank heartily the noble man Dr. P. Radhakrishna Sarma for furnishing the old and rare printed books of various editions of Bhagavata with commentaries, without which the Critical Edition of the Śrī Bhāgavata could not have been brought forth. Many hearty thanks are due to Sri K. Appanacharya, Special Officer, Dasasahitya Project, TTD and Dr. M.S. Narayana Murty, Director, S.V. University Oriental Research Institute, Tirupati for furnishing me with the required books. In fine, I express my sincere gratitude to all those other scholars too, who have helped me in one way or the other. Lastly I thank M/s Om Shakti Laser Type Setters and Printers for their neat execution. 
Now the second volume of the tenth skandha along with the three commentaries, Introduction, Appendices is being presented to the connoisseurs. By the oversight some mistakes might have crept in, for which I crave the indulgence of the readers. The concrete suggestions, if any, for the improvement of this edition are always welcome. 
I feel amply rewarded if this Edition can serve the purpose of the readers and scholars and fulfil the objective of T.T.Devasthanams in propagating Hindu Culture and Religion.
