In his viṣṇupurāṇa commentary, Śrīdhara-svāmī makes it unambiguously clear that he is an advaitin. He declares all of prapañca to be mithyā in the commentary on 2.6.42 and mentions all the classical advaitic concepts like adhyāsa-apavāda and aparokṣa-jñāna in 2.6.46

Further he is quite explicit that there is nothing sajātīya *and* vijātīya to ātmā in the commentary on 2.13.13-2.13.18. He elucidates the mithyātvam (according to him) of all the cetana padārthas
Image
As for the cetana (ātmā), he is clear that there is just one, and vitiating any doubts about his being a bhedābhedin (as some have claimed) he emphatically declares even the yoga for jīva-paramātma-aikya to be ultimately mithyā since there are the same (accdg to him) in 2.14.27
Image
He goes on to declare in the commentary for 2.14.28: "na tu prati-deha-bhinnaḥ" (no different soul in each body). And gives the example of a single vāyu through a flute to illustrate one ātmā having different upādhi bhedas (again classic śāṅkara advaita to my limited knowledge)
Image

And for 2.16.23 he again emphasizes "pratyakṣa-bheda-bhrama" on the single apratyakṣa ātmā as being illustrated by the example of ākāśa (notice also the mūla-śloka)
