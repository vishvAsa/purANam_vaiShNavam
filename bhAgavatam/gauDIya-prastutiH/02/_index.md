Sources:



* _Bhāgavata-tātparya_. Anandatirtha Madhvacarya. \
Transcription by Jan Brzezinski. Taken from Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha’s edition (Calcutta : Chaitanya Vani Preḥ s, 1995).
* _Bhāvārtha-dīpikā_. Sridhara Svami. \
Transcribed by Jan Klapis and proofread by Robert Gafrik from Sri Pandita Ramateja Pandeya's edition published by Caukhamba Samskrita Pratishthana in Vraja-jivana Pracya-bharati Grantha-mala series (28), reprinted in 1987. Gafrik and Klapis included all the pandit’s notes, even those refering to other commentaries, but some of them have been removed where they refer to other commentaries included in this edition, or where they give a source reference. This is one of the sources for the reading of the Bhāgavata text itself.
* _Krama-sandarbha_. Sri Jiva Gosvami. \
The authoritative source document here is Puridas’s 1952 edition (Vrindavan Das : Haridas Sharma). Primary transcription—where Shat-sandarbha text was available on the Gaudiya Grantha Mandira, it was used after comparison and correction. Most, though not all, croḥ s-references have been given. Another transcription by Durmada Das was made available, which was also compared and corrected. I don’t know which Durmada Das used, but it does not seem to fit in clearly to the sources used in Puridas. Some footnotes refer to these alternate readings, but this has not been done thoroughly. I have used the same references given by Puridas.


> * (ka) MS 516 in the Baranagar Gauranga Grantha Mandir.
> * (kha) MS 137 in the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad Library.
> * (ga) MS IIIC100 in the Asiatic Society Library, dated 1714.
> * (gha) Another MS in Bengali script. No further information.
> * (na) Ramanarayan Vidyaratna’s edition (Murshidabad, 1892).

Unfortunately, as is the case with all Puridas’s editions, there is no discussion of the critical process used. 

* _Sārārtha-darśinī_ of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. \
Taken from Bhakti Ballabh Tirtha’s edition (Calcutta : Chaitanya Vani Preḥ s, 1995). Transcription by Jan Brzezinski. This volume is one of the sources for the reading of the Bhagavata text itself.
* _Catuḥśloki-bhāṣya_. Srinivasa Acarya. \
A special feature of this commentary is the inclusion of Srinivas Acharya’s commentary on the the catuhsloki (2.9.30-36). Taken from Haridas Shastri’s undated edition (ca. 1983). Transcription by Jan Brzezinski.
* _Śrīmad-bhāgavata-mahā-purāṇa_. In two volumes with Hindi translation. 13th edition. Gorakhpur: Gita Preḥ s, 1989. \
This edition was used to help establish the Bhagavata text itself. 
* _Kaivalya-dīpikā _is Hemachandra's commentary on _Mukta-phala_ of Vopadeva (ed.) Isvara Chandra Sastri and Pandit Haridasa Vidyasagara, Calcutta 1920.

There have been some formatting problems due to Microsoft Word’s handy complex scripts function, which I seem to be unable to disable. Hopefully, most of the complexities have been unraveled. (Jan Brzezinski 2006-02-10)
