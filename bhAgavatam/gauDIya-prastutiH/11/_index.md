1.03

Complete edition of Eleventh Canto with commentaries of

Madhva, Śrīdhara, Jīva Gosvāmin (Krama-sandarbha) and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.

This edition does not have Srinath Chakravarti. Comments by Sanatan Goswami on the Eleventh Canto found in *Hari-bhakti-vilāsa* and *Br̥had-bhāgavatāmr̥ta* have been included where found. Where the Sandarbhas differ from Krama-sandarbha, those comments have also been added, as well as the comments given by Viśvanātha or Śrī Jīva to other texts citing verses from the Eleventh Canto.\

______

No single edition was used consistently throughout, so that information is not being given here. There are only a few footnotes and notifications of variants, etc., usually based on a comparison to the Ṣaṭ-sandarbha comments.
