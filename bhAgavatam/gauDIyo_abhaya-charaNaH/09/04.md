CHAPTER FOUR

This chapter describes the history of Mahārāja Nabhaga, of his son Nābhāga, and of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa.

The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Nābhāga lived for many years in the *gurukula.* In Nābhāga’s absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among themselves. When Nābhāga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but when Nābhāga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and describe two *mantras* to be chanted there. Nābhāga executed the order of his father, and thus Aṅgirā and other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice. To test Nābhāga, Lord Śiva challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord Śiva was satisfied by Nābhāga’s behavior, Lord Śiva offered him all the riches.

From Nābhāga was born Ambarīṣa, the most powerful and celebrated devotee. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence. He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This process is called *yukta-vairāgya,* or feasible renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying material opulence, he never desired even liberation.

Once Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vṛndāvana, observing the vow of Dvādaśī. On Dvādaśī, the day after Ekādaśī, when he was about to break his Ekādaśī fast, the great mystic *yogī* Durvāsā appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambarīṣa respectfully received Durvāsā Muni, and Durvāsā Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamunā River at noontime. Because he was absorbed in *samādhi,* he did not come back very soon. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the advice of learned *brāhmaṇas,* just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By mystic power, Durvāsā Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry. When he returned he began to chastise Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always the protector of His devotee, and to protect Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, He sent His disc, the Sudarśana *cakra,* which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durvāsā, who was so envious of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. Durvāsā fled to Brahmaloka, Śivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarśana *cakra.* Finally he went to the spiritual world and surrendered to Lord Nārāyaṇa, but Lord Nārāyaṇa could not excuse a person who had offended a Vaiṣṇava. To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaiṣṇava whom he has offended. There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord Nārāyaṇa advised Durvāsā to return to Mahārāja Ambarīṣa and beg his pardon.

श्रीशुक उवाच  
नाभागो नभगापत्यं यं ततं भ्रातर- कविम् ।  
यविष्ठं व्यभजन् दायं ब्रह्मचारिणमागतम् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*nābhāgo nabhagāpatyaṁ  
yaṁ tataṁ bhrātaraḥ kavim  
yaviṣṭhaṁ vyabhajan dāyaṁ  
brahmacāriṇam āgatam*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *nābhāgaḥ* — Nābhāga; *nabhaga*-*apatyam* — was the son of Mahārāja Nabhaga; *yam* — unto whom; *tatam* — the father; *bhrātaraḥ* — the elder brothers; *kavim* — the learned; *yaviṣṭham* — the youngest; *vyabhajan* — divided; *dāyam* — the property; *brahmacāriṇam* — having accepted the life of a *brahmacārī* perpetually (*naiṣṭhika*); *āgatam* — returned.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: The son of Nabhaga named Nābhāga lived for a long time at the place of his spiritual master. Therefore, his brothers thought that he was not going to become a gṛhastha and would not return. Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of their father among themselves. When Nābhāga returned from the place of his spiritual master, they gave him their father as his share.**

### Purport

There are two kinds of *brahmacārīs.* One may return home, marry and become a householder, whereas the other, known as *bṛhad-vrata,* takes a vow to remain a *brahmacārī* perpetually. The *bṛhad-vrata brahmacārī* does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly takes *sannyāsa.* Because Nābhāga did not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers thought that he had taken *bṛhadvrata-brahmacarya.* Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when he returned they gave him their father as his share.

I am not your property.”**

### Purport

Nābhāga was very simple hearted. Therefore when he went to his father, the father, out of compassion for his son, suggested that as a means of livelihood Nābhāga could go to the descendants of Aṅgirā and take advantage of their misgivings in performing *yajña.*

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the most fortunate personality, achieved the rule of the entire world, consisting of seven islands, and achieved inexhaustible, unlimited opulence and prosperity on earth. Although such a position is rarely obtained, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa did not care for it at all, for he knew very well that all such opulence is material. Like that which is imagined in a dream, such opulence will ultimately be destroyed. The King knew that any nondevotee who attains such opulence merges increasingly into material nature’s mode of darkness.**

### Purport

For a devotee material opulence is insignificant, whereas for a nondevotee material opulence is the cause of increasing bondage, for a devotee knows that anything material is temporary, whereas a nondevotee regards the temporary so-called happiness as everything and forgets the path of self-realization. Thus for the nondevotee material opulence is a disqualification for spiritual advancement.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Ambarīṣa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord’s temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Kṛṣṇa or about Kṛṣṇa. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa’s temples and Kṛṣṇa’s places like Mathurā and Vṛndāvana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord’s devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasī offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord’s prasāda. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.1) the Lord recommends, *mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.* This indicates that one must execute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible, however, to train oneself without guidance from the spiritual master. Therefore, according to the instructions of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, the first business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various senses in rendering transcendental service to the Lord. The Lord also says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.1), *asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu.* In other words, if one wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by Kṛṣṇa by following in the footsteps of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. It is said, *hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate:* *bhakti* means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Kṛṣṇa, who is called Hṛṣīkeśa or Acyuta. These words are used in these verses. *Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, hṛṣīkeśa-padābhivandane.* The words Acyuta and Hṛṣīkeśa are also used in *Bhagavad-gītā.* *Bhagavad-gītā* is *kṛṣṇa-kathā* spoken directly by Kṛṣṇa, and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is also *kṛṣṇa-kathā* because everything described in the *Bhāgavatam* is in relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*evam* — thus (living a devotional life); *sadā* — always; *karma*-*kalāpam* — the prescribed occupational duties as a *kṣatriya* king; *ātmanaḥ* — of himself, personally (the head of the state); *pare* — unto the supreme transcendence; *adhiyajñe* — unto the supreme proprietor, the supreme enjoyer; *bhagavati* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *adhokṣaje* — unto He who is beyond material sense perception; *sarva*-*ātma*-*bhāvam* — all different varieties of devotional service; *vidadhat* — executing, offering; *mahīm* — the planet earth; *imām* — this; *tat*-*niṣṭha* — who are faithful devotees of the Lord; *vipra* — by such *brāhmaṇas*; *abhihitaḥ* — directed; *śaśāsa* — ruled; *ha* — in the past.

### Translation

**In performing his prescribed duties as king, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa always offered the results of his royal activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the enjoyer of everything and is beyond the perception of material senses. He certainly took advice from brāhmaṇas who were faithful devotees of the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29):

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ  
sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material world, and here in *Bhagavad-gītā* the peace formula is given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone should understand that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so on. The Lord has given perfect advice in *Bhagavad-gītā,* and Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, as the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a Vaiṣṇava, taking advice from Vaiṣṇava *brāhmaṇas.* The *śāstras* enjoin that even though a *brāhmaṇa* may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a *guru* until he is a Vaiṣṇava.

*ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro  
mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ  
avaiṣṇavo gurur na syād  
vaiṣṇavaḥ śva-paco guruḥ*

Therefore, as indicated here by the words *tan-niṣṭha-viprābhihitaḥ,* Mahārāja Ambarīṣa took advice from *brāhmaṇas* who were pure devotees of the Lord, for ordinary *brāhmaṇas* who are merely learned scholars or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice.

In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are authorized to make laws for the welfare of the state, but according to this description of the kingdom of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the country or the world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee *brāhmaṇas.* Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected by the ignorant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee *brāhmaṇas* in ruling the country, everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character will automatically follow.

*yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā  
sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ  
harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā  
manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ*

“One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.” (*Bhāg.* 5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a Kṛṣṇa conscious king will become devotees, and then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, as described here.

### Translation

**In desert countries where there flowed the river Sarasvatī, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa performed great sacrifices like the aśvamedha-yajña and thus satisfied the master of all yajñas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of dakṣiṇā to the brāhmaṇas, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasiṣṭha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.**

### Purport

When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the *Vedas,* one needs expert *brāhmaṇas* known as *yājñika-brāhmaṇas.* In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in *śāstra* is *saṅkīrtana-yajña* (*yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ*). Instead of spending money unnecessarily on performing *yajñas* impossible to perform in this Age of Kali because of the scarcity of *yājñika-brāhmaṇas,* one who is intelligent performs *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* Without properly performed *yajñas* to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be scarcity of rain (*yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ*). Therefore the performance of *yajña* is essential. Without *yajña* there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will be famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types of *yajñas,* such as the *aśvamedha-yajña,* to maintain the production of food grains. *Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.* Without food grains, both men and animals will starve. Therefore *yajña* is necessary for the state to perform because by *yajña* the people in general will be fed sumptuously. The *brāhmaṇas* and *yājñika* priests should be sufficiently paid for their expert service. This payment is called *dakṣiṇā.* Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, as the head of the state, performed all these *yajñas* through great personalities like Vasiṣṭha, Gautama and Asita. Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (*sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ*). The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere.

### Translation

**The citizens of the state of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa were accustomed to chanting and hearing about the glorious activities of the Personality of Godhead. Thus they never aspired to be elevated to the heavenly planets, which are extremely dear even to the demigods.**

### Purport

A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and His fame, qualities, form, paraphernalia and so on is never interested in elevation to the heavenly planets, even though such places are extremely dear even to the demigods.

*nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve  
na kutaścana bibhyati  
svargāpavarga-narakeṣv

“Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, never fear any condition of life. The heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to a devotee.” (*Bhāg.* 6.17.28) A devotee is always situated in the spiritual world. Therefore he does not desire anything. He is known as *akāma,* or desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was a most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were not interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly planets.

### Translation

**Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such achievements do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Kṛṣṇa within the core of his heart.**

### Purport

A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher planetary systems but even in the perfections of mystic *yoga.* Real perfection is devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in the impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic *yoga* (*aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti* and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee. As stated by Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī:

*kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate  
durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate  
viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate  
yat kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ*

(*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 5)

When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he regards material happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o’-the-wisp. As far as the perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic *yogī* is especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the service of the Lord (*hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*) there is no need for separate control of the senses. For those who are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee’s senses are all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled. *Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate* (Bg. 2.59). A devotee’s senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and material world is the mentality of service. *Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.* When there is no mentality of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one’s activities are material.

*prāpañcikatayā buddhyā  
hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ  
mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo  
vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate*

(*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.256)

That which is engaged in the service of the Lord is not material, and nothing thus engaged should be given up. In the construction of a high skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the same enthusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual. Spiritual activities should not be confused with material activities and given up. Nothing connected with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is material. A devotee who considers all this is always situated in spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (*paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate*).

### Translation

**The king of this planet, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, thus performed devotional service to the Lord and in this endeavor practiced severe austerity. Always satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his constitutional activities, he gradually gave up all material desires.**

### Purport

Severe austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many varieties. For example, in worshiping the Deity in the temple there are certainly laborious activities. *Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau.* One must decorate the Deity, cleanse the temple, bring water from the Ganges and Yamunā, continue the routine work, perform *ārati* many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity, prepare dresses and so on. In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity. Similarly, the hard labor involved in preaching, preparing literature, preaching to atheistic men and distributing literature door to door is of course an austerity (*tapo-yuktena*). *Tapo divyaṁ putrakā.* Such austerity is necessary. *Yena sattvaṁ śuddhyet.* By such austerity in devotional service, one is purified of material existence (*kāmān śanair jahau*). Indeed, such austerity leads one to the constitutional position of devotional service. In this way one can give up material desires, and as soon as one is freed from material desires, he is free from the repetition of birth and death, old age and disease.

**Mahārāja Ambarīṣa gave up all attachment to household affairs, wives, children, friends and relatives, to the best of powerful elephants, to beautiful chariots, carts, horses and inexhaustible jewels, and to ornaments, garments and an inexhaustible treasury. He gave up attachment to all of them, regarding them as temporary and material.**

### Purport

*Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.* Material possessions can be accepted as far as they can be used in devotional service. *Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam.* *Ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ prātikūlyasya varjanam.* In preaching, many things considered material are needed. A devotee should not have any attachment for such material involvements as house, wife, children, friends and cars. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, for example, had all such things, but he was not attached to them. This is the effect of *bhakti-yoga.* *Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca* (*Bhāg.* 11.2.42). One who is advanced in devotional service has no attachment for material things for sense enjoyment, but for preaching, to spread the glories of the Lord, he accepts such things without attachment. *Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.* Everything can be used to the extent that it can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service.

### Translation

**Being very pleased by the unalloyed devotion of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave the King His disc, which is fearful to enemies and which always protects the devotee from enemies and adversities.**

### Purport

A devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, may not be expert in self-defense, but because a devotee fully depends on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is always sure of protection by the Lord. Prahlāda Mahārāja said:

*naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraṇyās  
tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ*

(*Bhāg.* 7.9.43)

A devotee is always merged in the ocean of the transcendental bliss of rendering service to the Lord. Therefore he is not at all afraid of any adverse situation in the material world. The Lord also promises, *kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati:* “O Arjuna, you may declare to the world that the devotees of the Lord are never vanquished.” (Bg. 9.31) For the protection of the devotees, Kṛṣṇa’s disc, the Sudarśana *cakra,* is always ready. This disc is extremely fearful to the nondevotees (*pratyanīka-bhayāvaham*). Therefore although Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was fully engaged in devotional service, his kingdom was free of all fear of adversity.

To observe Ekādaśī-vrata and Dvādaśī-vrata means to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those interested in advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness must observe Ekādaśī-vrata regularly. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa’s queen was equally as qualified as the King. Therefore it was possible for Mahārāja Ambarīṣa to engage his life in household affairs. In this regard, the word *tulya-śīlayā* is very significant. Unless a wife is equally as qualified as her husband, household affairs are very difficult to continue. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita advises that a person in such a situation should immediately give up household life and become a *vānaprastha* or *sannyāsī:*

*mātā yasya gṛhe nāsti  
bhāryā cāpriya-vādinī  
araṇyaṁ tena gantavyaṁ  
yathāraṇyaṁ tathā gṛham*

A person who has no mother at home and whose wife is not agreeable with him should immediately go away to the forest. Because human life is meant for spiritual advancement only, one’s wife must be helpful in this endeavor. Otherwise there is no need of household life.

After giving these cows, the King first sumptuously fed all the brāhmaṇas, and when they were fully satisfied, he was about to observe the end of Ekādaśī, with their permission, by breaking the fast. Exactly at that time, however, Durvāsā Muni, the great and powerful mystic, appeared on the scene as an uninvited guest.**

### Translation

**The King said: “To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the brāhmaṇas is certainly a great offense. On the other hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvādaśī, there is a flaw in one’s observance of the vow. Therefore, O brāhmaṇas, if you think that it will be auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water.” In this way, after consulting with the brāhmaṇas, the King reached this decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may be accepted as eating and also as not eating.**

### Purport

When Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, in his dilemma, consulted the *brāhmaṇas* about whether he should break the fast or wait for Durvāsā Muni, apparently they could not give a definite answer about what to do. A Vaiṣṇava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore Mahārāja Ambarīṣa himself decided, in the presence of the *brāhmaṇas,* that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a *brāhmaṇa.* In the *Vedas* it is said, *apo ’śnāti tan naivāśitaṁ naivānaśitam.* This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering to *satyāgraha* will not eat but will drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa decided to act in this way.

### Translation

**Alas, just see the behavior of this cruel man! He is not a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. Being proud of his material opulence and his position, he considers himself God. Just see how he has transgressed the laws of religion.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has diverted the entire meaning of this verse as spoken by Durvāsā Muni. Durvāsā Muni used the word *nṛ-śaṁsasya* to indicate that the King was cruel, but Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura interprets it to mean that the King’s character was glorified by all the local people. He says that the word *nṛ* means “by all the local people” and that *śaṁsasya* means “of he (Ambarīṣa) whose character was glorified.” Similarly, one who is very rich becomes mad because of his wealth and is therefore called *śriyā-unmattasya,* but Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura interprets these words to mean that although Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was such an opulent king, he was not mad after money, for he had already surpassed the madness of material opulence. Similarly, the word *īśa-māninaḥ* is interpreted to mean that he was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress the laws for observing Ekādaśī-pāraṇa, despite the thinking of Durvāsā Muni, for he only took water. In this way, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has supported Ambarīṣa Mahārāja and all his activities.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, you have invited me to eat as a guest, but instead of feeding me, you yourself have eaten first. Because of your misbehavior, I shall show you something to punish you.**

### Purport

A devotee cannot be defeated by a so-called mystic *yogī.* This will be proved by the failure of Durvāsā Muni’s endeavor to chastise Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. *Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ* (*Bhāg.* 5.18.12). One who is not a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord has no good qualifications, however great a mystic, philosopher or fruitive worker he may be. Only a devotee emerges victorious in all circumstances, as will be shown in this incident involving the rivalry between Durvāsā and Mahārāja Ambarīṣa.

**Taking a trident in his hand and making the surface of the earth tremble with his footsteps, that blazing creature came before Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. But the King, upon seeing him, was not at all disturbed and did not move even slightly from his position.**

### Purport

*Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati* (*Bhāg.* 6.17.28). A pure devotee of Nārāyaṇa is never afraid of any material danger. There are many examples of devotees such as Prahlāda Mahārāja, who was tortured by his father but was not at all afraid, although he was only a five-year-old boy. Therefore, following the examples of Ambarīṣa Mahārāja and Prahlāda Mahārāja, a devotee should learn how to tolerate all such awkward positions in this world. Devotees are often tortured by nondevotees, yet the pure devotee, depending fully on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed by such inimical activities.

### Translation

**As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake, so, by the previous order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His disc, the Sudarśana cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the created demon to protect the Lord’s devotee.**

### Purport

As a pure devotee, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, although in such danger, did not move an inch from his position, nor did he request the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give him protection. He was fixed in understanding, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the core of his heart. A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead always, not for any material profit, but as his duty. The Lord, however, knows how to protect His devotee. As indicated by the words *prāg diṣṭam,* the Lord knew everything. Therefore, before anything happened, He had already arranged for His *cakra* to protect Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. This protection is offered to a devotee even from the very beginning of his devotional service. *Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati* (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66): *ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.* Protection begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the devotee proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without outward disturbances. A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the furious snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy of a devotee may be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional service.

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.34) it is said, *mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham:* when the Supreme Personality of Godhead approaches as death, or the supreme controller of time, He takes everything away. In other words, all opulence, prestige and everything we possess is given by the Supreme Lord for some purpose. It is the duty of the surrendered soul to execute the orders of the Supreme. No one can disregard Him. Under the circumstances, Lord Brahmā refused to give shelter to Durvāsā Muni from the powerful Sudarśana *cakra* sent by the Lord.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brāhmaṇa: I am completely under the control of My devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.**

### Purport

All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, are fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully under the control of His devotee. Why is this? Because the devotee is *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya;* in other words, he has no material desires in his heart. His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to serve Him best. Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely favorable to the devotees — indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:* without being a devotee of a devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu identified Himself as *gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ.* Thus he instructed us to become not directly servants of Kṛṣṇa but servants of the servant of Kṛṣṇa. Devotees like Brahmā, Nārada, Vyāsadeva and Śukadeva Gosvāmī are directly servants of Kṛṣṇa, and one who becomes a servant of Nārada, Vyāsadeva and Śukadeva, like the Six Gosvāmīs, is still more devoted. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura therefore says, *yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ:* if one very sincerely serves the spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee. Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.

### Translation

**O best of the brāhmaṇas, without saintly persons for whom I am the only destination, I do not desire to enjoy My transcendental bliss and My supreme opulences.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy His transcendental bliss He requires the cooperation of His devotees. In Vṛndāvana, for example, although Lord Kṛṣṇa is full in Himself, He wants the cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the *gopīs* to increase His transcendental bliss. Such pure devotees, who can increase the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are certainly most dear to Him. Not only does the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoy the company of His devotees, but because He is unlimited He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. Thus, He descends to the material world to induce the nondevotees and rebellious living entities to return home, back to Godhead. He requests them to surrender unto Him because, unlimited as He is, He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an attempt to increase the number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more and more. It is certain that a devotee who helps in this endeavor to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the Supreme Lord. Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does not feel transcendental bliss without His devotees. An example that may be cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have sons in a family he does not feel happiness. Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a son to complete his happiness. The science of transcendental bliss is known to the pure devotee. Therefore the pure devotee is always engaged in increasing the transcendental happiness of the Lord.

### Translation

**Since pure devotees give up their homes, wives, children, relatives, riches and even their lives simply to serve Me, without any desire for material improvement in this life or in the next, how can I give up such devotees at any time?**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the words *brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.* Thus He is the well-wisher of the *brāhmaṇas.* Durvāsā Muni was certainly a very great *brāhmaṇa,* but because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service. Great mystic *yogīs* are actually self-interested. The proof is that when Durvāsā Muni created a demon to kill Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depending solely and wholly on Him, whereas when Durvāsā Muni was chased by the Sudarśana *cakra* by the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe. At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in his own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore, he did not have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give all protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of serving Him.

Another point in this verse is that attachment to *dārāgāra-putrāpta* — home, wife, children, friendship, society and love — is not the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure devotee. Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme Lord to the best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to take away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so on. This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to Godhead.

The pure devotee is actually equal toward everyone, as confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54): *brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati/ samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.* Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (*paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*). A pure devotee is actually learned because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically liberated (*brahma-bhūtaḥ*). He can therefore see everyone on the spiritual platform. He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all living entities. He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and that what is distress to him is distressing for others. Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone. As Prahlāda Mahārāja said:

*śoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyārtha-  
māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān*

(*Bhāg.* 7.9.43)

People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee’s chief concern, therefore, is to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

मत्सेवया प्रतीतं ते सालोक्यादिचतुष्टयम् ।  
नेच्छन्ति सेवया पूर्णा- कुतोऽन्यत् कालविप्लुतम् ॥ ६७ ॥

### Verse text

*mat-sevayā pratītaṁ te  
sālokyādi-catuṣṭayam  
necchanti sevayā pūrṇāḥ  
kuto ’nyat kāla-viplutam*

### Synonyms

*mat*-*sevayā* — by being engaged fully in My transcendental loving service; *pratītam* — automatically achieved; *te* — such pure devotees are fully satisfied; *sālokya*-*ādi*-*catuṣṭayam* — the four different types of liberation (*sālokya, sārūpya, sāmīpya* and *sārṣṭi,* what to speak of *sāyujya*); *na* — not; *icchanti* — desire; *sevayā* — simply by devotional service; *pūrṇāḥ* — fully complete; *kutaḥ* — where is the question; *anyat* — other things; *kāla*-*viplutam* — which are finished in the course of time.

### Translation

**My devotees, who are always satisfied to be engaged in My loving service, are not interested even in the four principles of liberation \[sālokya, sārūpya, sāmīpya and sārṣṭi\], although these are automatically achieved by their service. What then is to be said of such perishable happiness as elevation to the higher planetary systems?**

### Purport

Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura has estimated the value of liberation as follows:

*muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate ’smān  
dharmārtha-kāma-gatayaḥ samaya-pratīkṣāḥ*

Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura realized that if one develops his natural devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, *mukti* stands before him with folded hands to offer all kinds of service. In other words, the devotee is already liberated. There is no need for him to aspire for different types of liberation. The pure devotee automatically achieves liberation, even without desiring it.

### Purport

Since Durvāsā Muni wanted to chastise Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, it is to be understood that he wanted to give pain to the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the Lord says, *sādhavo hṛdayaṁ mahyam:* “The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart.” The Lord’s feelings are like those of a father, who feels pain when his child is in pain. Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet of a devotee. Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it causes devastation. Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee. Actually Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was not at all at fault; Durvāsā Muni unnecessarily wanted to chastise him on flimsy grounds. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa wanted to complete the Ekādaśī-pāraṇa as part of devotional service to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water. But although Durvāsā Muni was a great mystic *brāhmaṇa,* he did not know what is what. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees, being always situated in the core of the Lord’s heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.11):

*teṣām evānukampārtham  
aham ajñānajaṁ tamaḥ  
nāśayāmy ātma-bhāvastho  
jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā*

“Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.” The devotee does not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya.* Even the most learned or experienced person cannot understand the movements of a Vaiṣṇava, a pure devotee. No one, therefore, should criticize a pure Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava knows his own business; whatever he does is precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

ayaṁ hy ātmābhicāras te

### Synonyms

*upāyam* — the means of protection in this dangerous position; *kathayiṣyāmi* — I shall speak to you; *tava* — of your deliverance from this danger; *vipra* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *śṛṇuṣva* — just hear from me; *tat* — what I say; *ayam* — this action taken by you; *hi* — indeed; *ātma*-*abhicāraḥ* — self-envy or envious of yourself (your mind has become your enemy); *te* — for you; *yataḥ* — because of whom; *tam* — to him (Mahārāja Ambarīṣa); *yāhi* — immediately go; *mā* *ciram* — do not wait even a moment; *sādhuṣu* — unto devotees; *prahitam* — applied; *tejaḥ* — power; *prahartuḥ* — of the executor; *kurute* — does; *aśivam* — inauspiciousness.

### Translation

**O brāhmaṇa, let Me now advise you for your own protection. Please hear from Me. By offending Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, you have acted with self-envy. Therefore you should go to him immediately, without a moment’s delay. One’s so-called prowess, when employed against the devotee, certainly harms he who employs it. Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.**

### Purport

A Vaiṣṇava is always an object of envy for nondevotees, even when the nondevotee happens to be his father. To give a practical example, Hiraṇyakaśipu was envious of Prahlāda Mahārāja, but this envy of the devotee was harmful to Hiraṇyakaśipu, not to Prahlāda. Every action taken by Hiraṇyakaśipu against his son Prahlāda Mahārāja was taken very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when Hiraṇyakaśipu was on the verge of killing Prahlāda, the Lord personally appeared and killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. Service to a Vaiṣṇava gradually accumulates and becomes an asset for the devotee. Similarly, harmful activities directed against the devotee gradually become the ultimate cause of the performer’s falldown. Even such a great *brāhmaṇa* and mystic *yogī* as Durvāsā was in a most dangerous situation because of his offense at the lotus feet of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, a pure devotee.

तपो विद्या च विप्राणां नि-श्रेयसकरे उभे ।

### Verse text

*tapo vidyā ca viprāṇāṁ  
niḥśreyasa-kare ubhe  
te eva durvinītasya  
kalpete kartur anyathā*

### Synonyms

*tapaḥ* — austerities; *vidyā* — knowledge; *ca* — also; *viprāṇām* — of the *brāhmaṇas*; *niḥśreyasa* — of what is certainly very auspicious for upliftment; *kare* — are causes; *ubhe* — both of them; *te* — such austerity and knowledge; *eva* — indeed; *durvinītasya* — when such a person is an upstart; *kalpete* — become; *kartuḥ* — of the performer; *anyathā* — just the opposite.

### Translation

**For a brāhmaṇa, austerity and learning are certainly auspicious, but when acquired by a person who is not gentle, such austerity and learning are most dangerous.**

### Purport

It is said that a jewel is very valuable, but when it is on the hood of a serpent, it is dangerous despite its value. Similarly, when a materialistic nondevotee achieves great success in learning and austerity, that success is dangerous for all of society. So-called learned scientists, for example, invented atomic weapons that are dangerous for all humanity. It is therefore said, *maṇinā bhūṣitaḥ sarpaḥ kim asau na bhayaṅkaraḥ.* A serpent with a jewel on its hood is as dangerous as a serpent without such a jewel. Durvāsā Muni was a very learned *brāhmaṇa* equipped with mystic power, but because he was not a gentleman, he did not know how to use his power. He was therefore extremely dangerous. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a dangerous person who uses his mystic power for some personal design. By the laws of nature, therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for society but for the person who misuses it.

### Translation

**O best of the brāhmaṇas, you should therefore go immediately to King Ambarīṣa, the son of Mahārāja Nābhāga. I wish you all good fortune. If you can satisfy Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, then there will be peace for you.**

### Purport

In this regard, Madhva Muni quotes from the *Garuḍa Purāṇa:*

*brahmādi-bhakti-koṭy-aṁśād  
aṁśo naivāmbarīṣake  
naivanyasya cakrasyāpi  
tathāpi harir īśvaraḥ*

*tātkālikopaceyatvāt  
teṣāṁ yaśasa ādirāṭ  
brahmādayaś ca tat-kīrtiṁ  
vyañjayām āsur uttamām*

*mohanāya ca daityānāṁ  
brahmāde nindanāya ca  
anyārthaṁ ca svayaṁ viṣṇur  
brahmādyāś ca nirāśiṣaḥ*

*mānuṣeṣūttamātvāc ca  
teṣāṁ bhaktyādibhir guṇaiḥ  
brahmāder viṣṇv-adhīnatva-  
jñāpanāya ca kevalam*

*durvāsāś ca svayaṁ rudras  
tathāpy anyāyām uktavān  
tasyāpy anugrahārthāya  
darpa-nāśārtham eva ca*

The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Mahārāja Ambarīṣa and Durvāsā Muni is that all the demigods, including Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, are under the control of Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore, when a Vaiṣṇava is offended, the offender is punished by Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord. No one can protect such a person, even Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Ambarīṣa Mahārāja Offended by Durvāsā Muni.”*
