CHAPTER SIXTEEN

When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, as described in this chapter, Paraśurāma rid the entire world of *kṣatriyas* twenty-one times. This chapter also describes the descendants of Viśvāmitra.

When Jamadagni’s wife, Reṇukā, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsarās, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband. Paraśurāma killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord Paraśurāma, and therefore when Paraśurāma was absent from the *āśrama,* they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Paraśurāma returned to the *āśrama* and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the *kṣatriyas* on the surface of the world. Taking up his axe, he went to Māhiṣmatī-pura, the capital of Kārtavīryārjuna, and killed all of Kārtavīryārjuna’s sons, whose blood became a great river. Paraśurāma, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna; later, when the *kṣatriyas* became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no *kṣatriyas* on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, Paraśurāma joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarṣi-maṇḍala. Paraśurāma, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata. In the next *manvantara,* he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.

In the dynasty of Gādhi, the most powerful Viśvāmitra took birth. By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a *brāhmaṇa.* He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandās. In the sacrificial arena of Hariścandra, the son of Ajīgarta named Śunaḥśepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajāpatis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devarāta in the dynasty of Gādhi. The fifty elder sons of Viśvāmitra, however, did not accept Śunaḥśepha as their elder brother, and therefore Viśvāmitra cursed them to become *mlecchas,* unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Viśvāmitra’s fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Śunaḥśepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Viśvāmitra, being satisfied, blessed them. Thus Devarāta was accepted in the dynasty of Kauśika, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty.

The word *prabhāva-jñaḥ* is significant. Paraśurāma knew the prowess of his father, and therefore he agreed to carry out his father’s order. He thought that if he refused to carry out the order he would be cursed, but if he carried it out his father would be pleased, and when his father was pleased, Paraśurāma would ask the benediction of having his mother and brothers brought back to life. Paraśurāma was confident in this regard, and therefore he agreed to kill his mother and brothers.

### Translation

**My dear King Parīkṣit, the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, who were defeated by the superior strength of Paraśurāma, never achieved happiness, for they always remembered the killing of their father.**

### Purport

Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but because of a slight offense by his poor wife, Reṇukā, he ordered that she be killed. This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kārtavīryārjuna, as described herein. Lord Paraśurāma was also infected by sin because of killing Kārtavīryārjuna, although this was not very offensive. Therefore, whether one be Kārtavīryārjuna, Lord Paraśurāma, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise one must suffer the results of sinful activities. This is the lesson we receive from Vedic literature.

### Translation

**With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Paraśurāma created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the kṣatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Paraśurāma, on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the kṣatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times. Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pañcaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.**

### Purport

Paraśurāma is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal mission is *paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām* — to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants. To kill all the sinful men is one among the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead. Lord Paraśurāma killed all the *kṣatriyas* twenty-one times consecutively because they were disobedient to the brahminical culture. That the *kṣatriyas* had killed his father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the *kṣatriyas,* the ruling class, had become polluted, their position was inauspicious. Brahminical culture is enjoined in the *śāstra,* especially in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ*). According to the laws of nature, whether at the time of Paraśurāma or at the present, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful, not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like Paraśurāma to create a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some other calamity. Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of *varṇāśrama-dharma,* it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Paraśurāma.

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.9), *yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:* “Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.” *Karma-bandhanaḥ* refers to the repeated acceptance of one material body after another. The whole problem of life is this repetition of birth and death. Therefore one is advised to work to perform *yajña* meant for satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. Although Lord Paraśurāma was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities. Anyone in this material world, however careful he may be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not want to. For example, one may trample many small ants and other insects while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly. Therefore the Vedic principle of *pañca-yajña,* five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is compulsory. In this Age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to people in general. *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:* we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. *Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam:* although He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, He always chants Hare Kṛṣṇa and preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* The performance of *saṅkīrtana-yajña* is a special concession for human society to save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities. We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.*

These seven stars are seen every night, and they each make a complete orbit around the polestar within twenty-four hours. Along with these seven stars, all the others stars also orbit from east to west. The upper portion of the universe is called the north, and the lower portion is called the south. Even in our ordinary dealings, while studying a map, we regard the upper portion of the map as north.

### Translation

**Viśvāmitra, the son of Mahārāja Gādhi, was as powerful as the flames of fire. From the position of a kṣatriya, he achieved the position of a powerful brāhmaṇa by undergoing penances and austerities.**

### Purport

Now, having narrated the history of Lord Paraśurāma, Śukadeva Gosvāmī begins the history of Viśvāmitra. From the history of Paraśurāma we can understand that although Paraśurāma belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a *kṣatriya.* Later, after finishing his work as a *kṣatriya,* he again became a *brāhmaṇa* and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that although Viśvāmitra was born in a *kṣatriya* family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a *brāhmaṇa.* These histories confirm the statements in *śāstra* that a *brāhmaṇa* may become a *kṣatriya,* a *kṣatriya* may become a *brāhmaṇa* or *vaiśya,* and a *vaiśya* may become a *brāhmaṇa,* by achieving the required qualities. One’s status does not depend upon birth. As confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.11.35) by Nārada:

*yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ  
puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam  
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta  
tat tenaiva vinirdiśet*

“If one shows the symptoms of being a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra,* even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification.” To know who is a *brāhmaṇa* and who is a *kṣatriya,* one must consider a man’s quality and work. If all the unqualified *śūdras* become so-called *brāhmaṇas* and *kṣatriyas,* social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish.

### Purport

Here is a description of Śunaḥśepha. When Hariścandra was to sacrifice his son Rohita, Rohita arranged to save his own life by purchasing Śunaḥśepha from Śunaḥśepha’s father to be sacrificed in the *yajña.* Śunaḥśepha was sold to Mahārāja Hariścandra because he was the middle son, between the oldest and the youngest. It appears that the sacrifice of a man as an animal in *yajña* has been practiced for a very long time.

**When requested by their father to accept Śunaḥśepha as the eldest son, the elder fifty of the Madhucchandās, the sons of Viśvāmitra, did not agree.

### Purport

In Vedic literature there are names like *mleccha* and *yavana.* The *mlecchas* are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic principles. In former days, the *mlecchas* were fewer, and Viśvāmitra Muni cursed his sons to become *mlecchas.* But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for people are automatically *mlecchas.* This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the entire population will consist of *mlecchas* because no one will follow the Vedic principles. At that time the incarnation Kalki will appear. *Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi karavālam.* He will kill all the *mlecchas* indiscriminately with his sword.

**Thus the younger Madhucchandās accepted Śunaḥśepha as their eldest brother and told him, “We shall follow your orders.” Viśvāmitra then said to his obedient sons, “Because you have accepted Śunaḥśepha as your eldest brother, I am very satisfied. By accepting my order, you have made me a father of worthy sons, and therefore I bless all of you to become the fathers of sons also.”**

### Purport

Of the one hundred sons, half disobeyed Viśvāmitra by not accepting Śunaḥśepha as their eldest brother, but the other half accepted his order. Therefore the father blessed the obedient sons to become the fathers of sons. Otherwise they too would have been cursed to be sonless *mlecchas.*
