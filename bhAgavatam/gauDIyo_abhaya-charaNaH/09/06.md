CHAPTER SIX

After describing the descendants of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, Śukadeva Gosvāmī described all the kings from Śaśāda to Māndhātā, and in this connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the daughters of Māndhātā.

Mahārāja Ambarīṣa had three sons, named Virūpa, Ketumān and Śambhu. The son of Virūpa was Pṛṣadaśva, and his son was Rathītara. Rathītara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great sage Aṅgirā, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathītara’s wife. When the sons were born, they became the dynasty of Aṅgirā Ṛṣi and of Rathītara.

The son of Manu was Ikṣvāku, who had one hundred sons, of whom Vikukṣi, Nimi and Daṇḍakā were the eldest. The sons of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violating sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikukṣi, was banished from the kingdom. By the mercy of Vasiṣṭha and the power of mystic *yoga,* Mahārāja Ikṣvāku attained liberation after giving up his material body. When Mahārāja Ikṣvāku expired, his son Vikukṣi returned and took charge of the kingdom. He performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Vikukṣi later became celebrated as Śaśāda.

Vikukṣi’s son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and because of his valuable service he became famous as Purañjaya, Indravāha and Kakutstha. The son of Purañjaya was Anenā, the son of Anenā was Pṛthu, and the son of Pṛthu was Viśvagandhi. The son of Viśvagandhi was Candra, the son of Candra was Yuvanāśva, and his son was Śrāvasta, who constructed Śrāvastī Purī. The son of Śrāvasta was Bṛhadaśva. Bṛhadaśva’s son Kuvalayāśva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as Dhundhumāra, “the killer of Dhundhu.” The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Dṛḍhāśva, Kapilāśva and Bhadrāśva. He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu. The son of Dṛḍhāśva was Haryaśva, the son of Haryaśva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha was Bahulāśva, and the son of Bahulāśva was Kṛśāśva. The son of Kṛśāśva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanāśva.

Yuvanāśva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest. In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajña on his behalf. Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing *yajña.* Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck. Thus the son became known as Māndhātā. In due course of time, Yuvanāśva achieved perfection by performing austerities.

Thereafter, Māndhātā became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands. Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu, meaning “one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves.” Māndhātā begot sons in the womb of his wife, Bindumatī. These sons were Purukutsa, Ambarīṣa and Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.

In this connection, Śukadeva Gosvāmī described the history of Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell from his *yoga* and wanted to marry all the daughters of Māndhātā for sexual pleasure. Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of *vānaprastha,* performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In this regard, Śukadeva Gosvāmī described how Saubhari Muni’s wives also became perfect.

### Translation

**Rathītara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Aṅgirā to beget sons for him. Because of this request, Aṅgirā begot sons in the womb of Rathītara’s wife. All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.**

### Purport

In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the womb of a lesser man’s wife for the sake of better progeny. In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land. Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but the sons born of her would then become her husband’s sons. Such sons were called *kṣetra-jāta.* Because Rathītara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.

### Translation

**Having been born from the womb of Rathītara’s wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of Rathītara, but because they were born from the semen of Aṅgirā, they were also known as the dynasty of Aṅgirā. Among all the progeny of Rathītara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their birth, they were considered brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the meaning of *dvi-jātayaḥ* as “mixed caste,” indicating a mixture of *brāhmaṇa* and *kṣatriya.*

### Purport

According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, although the *Bhāgavatam* (9.1.11-12) has previously included Ikṣvāku among the ten sons begotten by Manu in his wife Śraddhā, this was a generalization. It is here specifically explained that Ikṣvāku was born simply from the sneezing of Manu.

तथेति स वनं गत्वा मृगान् हत्वा क्रियार्हणान् ।  
श्रान्तो बुभुक्षितो वीर- शशं चाददपस्मृति- ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*tatheti sa vanaṁ gatvā  
mṛgān hatvā kriyārhaṇān  
śrānto bubhukṣito vīraḥ  
śaśaṁ cādad apasmṛtiḥ*

### Synonyms

*tathā* — according to the direction; *iti* — thus; *saḥ* — Vikukṣi; *vanam* — to the forest; *gatvā* — going; *mṛgān* — animals; *hatvā* — killing; *kriyā*-*arhaṇān* — suitable for offering to the *yajña* in the *śrāddha* ceremony; *śrāntaḥ* — when he was fatigued; *bubhukṣitaḥ* — and hungry; *vīraḥ* — the hero; *śaśam* — a rabbit; *ca* — also; *ādat* — he ate; *apasmṛtiḥ* — forgetting (that the flesh was meant for offering in the *śrāddha*).

### Translation

**Thereafter, Ikṣvāku’s son Vikukṣi went to the forest and killed many animals suitable for being offered as oblations. But when fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.**

### Purport

It is evident that *kṣatriyas* killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of *yajña.* Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as *śrāddha* is also a kind of *yajña.* In this *yajña,* flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered. However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the *Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa,* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said:

*aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ  
sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam  
devareṇa sutotpattiṁ  
kalau pañca vivarjayet*

“In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of *sannyāsa,* the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife.” The word *pala-paitṛkam* refers to an offering of flesh in oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are *śūdras,* not *kṣatriyas.* According to Vedic injunctions, however, only *kṣatriyas* are allowed to hunt, whereas *śūdras* are allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kālī or similar demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in *Bhagavad-gītā* Kṛṣṇa personally speaks of *go-rakṣyam,* cow protection. Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the *śāstra,* are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given all protection.

### Translation

**Vikukṣi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Ikṣvāku, who gave it to Vasiṣṭha for purification. But Vasiṣṭha could immediately understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by Vikukṣi, and therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the śrāddha ceremony.**

### Purport

That which is meant to be offered in *yajña* cannot be tasted by anyone before being offered to the Deity. In our temples, this regulation is in effect. One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the Deity. If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is polluted and can no longer be offered. Those engaged in Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved from committing offenses in Deity worship.

Since the King has thus rejected me, I shall reform my body in such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women, what to speak of the daughters of worldly kings.**

### Translation

**Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe austerities resulted in an opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants, and varieties of parks with clear-water lakes and gardens. In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of flowers, birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers. Saubhari Muni’s home was amply provided with valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes. Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia, the muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.**

### Purport

Saubhari Ṛṣi was a great *yogī.* Yogic perfection makes available eight material opulences — *aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, vaśitva* and *kāmāvasāyitā.* Saubhari Muni exhibited superexcellence in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection. The word *bahv-ṛca* means “expert in chanting *mantras.*” As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be achieved by subtle means through *mantras.* By chanting *mantras,* Saubhari Muni arranged for material opulence, but this was not perfection in life. As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the *vānaprastha* order and achieved final success. Those who are not *ātma-tattva-vit,* who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are *ātma-tattva-vit* are not inspired by material opulence. This is the instruction we can derive from the life and activities of Saubhari Muni.

Everyone is proud of his own position, but here was an astounding experience, in which the emperor of the entire world felt himself defeated in all details of material happiness by the opulence of Saubhari Muni.

### Synonyms

*evam* — in this way; *gṛheṣu* — in household affairs; *abhirataḥ* — being always engaged; *viṣayān* — material paraphernalia; *vividhaiḥ* — with varieties of; *sukhaiḥ* — happiness; *sevamānaḥ* — enjoying; *na* — not; *ca* — also; *atuṣyat* — satisfied him; *ājya*-*stokaiḥ* — by drops of fat; *iva* — like; *analaḥ* — a fire.

### Translation

**In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the material world, but he was not at all satisfied, just as a fire never ceases blazing if constantly supplied with drops of fat.**

### Purport

Material desire is just like a blazing fire. If a fire is continually supplied with drops of fat, the fire will increase more and more and never be extinguished. Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material desires by catering to one’s material demands will never be successful. In modern civilization, everyone is engaged in economic development, which is another way of constantly dropping fat into the material fire. The Western countries have reached the summit of material civilization, but people are still dissatisfied. Real satisfaction is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29), where Kṛṣṇa says:

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ  
sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

“The sages who knows Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.” One must therefore take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by properly following the regulative principles. Then one can attain an eternal, blissful life in peace and knowledge.

### Translation

**Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded place, he thought to himself about the cause of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.**

### Purport

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a *vaiṣṇava-aparādha.* The history is that when Garuḍa wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuḍa’s plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaiṣṇava. Because of this *vaiṣṇava-aparādha,* an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic *tapasya.* One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaiṣṇava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident concerning Saubhari Muni.

Everyone should observe this falldown and learn from it.**

### Translation

**A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and should not employ his senses externally \[in seeing, hearing, talking, walking and so on\]. One should always stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should associate with persons similarly engaged.**

### Purport

Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience, instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side of the material ocean must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and accumulating money. This is also advised by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

*niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukasya  
pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya  
sandarśanaṁ viṣayiṇām atha yoṣitāṁ ca  
hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato ’py asādhu*

(*Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* 8.27)

“Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly.”

One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He must not associate with *viṣayī* — materialistic persons or those interested in sex life. Every materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura also recommends that one engage in the service of the *ācāryas,* and if one wants to live in association, he must live in the association of devotees (*tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta-sane vāsa*). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs. Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By gradually associating with the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, simply by taking *prasāda* and taking part in chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* ordinary persons are being considerably elevated. Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water. Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association.

Then I became the husband of fifty wives, and in each of them I begot one hundred sons, and thus my family increased to five thousand members. By the influence of the modes of material nature, I became fallen and thought that I would be happy in material life. Thus there is no end to my material desires for enjoyment, in this life and the next.**

**When Saubhari Muni, who was quite conversant with the self, went to the forest, he performed severe penances. In this way, in the fire at the time of death, he ultimately engaged himself in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more desire for material enjoyment the subtle body is also ended, and in this way a pure soul remains. This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti*). If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. *Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti:* he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage.

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, by observing their husband progressing in spiritual existence, Saubhari Muni’s wives were also able to enter the spiritual world by his spiritual power, just as the flames of a fire cease when the fire is extinguished.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.32), *striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim.* Women are not considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Downfall of Saubhari Muni.”*
