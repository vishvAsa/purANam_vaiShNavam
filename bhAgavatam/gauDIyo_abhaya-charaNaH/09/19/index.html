This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Mahārāja Yayāti achieved liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.
After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayāti finally became disgusted with such materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved Devayānī. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brāhmaṇa owner, to whom she described her husband’s behavior. The brāhmaṇa became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brāhmaṇa’s pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one’s lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The śāstra therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man. King Yayāti, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyāsī, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his beloved wife, Devayānī, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.">

  <p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>
<p>This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Mahārāja Yayāti achieved liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.</p>
<p>After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayāti finally became disgusted with such materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved Devayānī. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her <em>brāhmaṇa</em> owner, to whom she described her husband’s behavior. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon, the he-goat begged the <em>brāhmaṇa’s</em> pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one’s lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The <em>śāstra</em> therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man. King Yayāti, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or <em>sannyāsī,</em> giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his beloved wife, Devayānī, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>

<h3 id="purport">Purport</h3>
<p>Persons who live in the village or town are called <em>grāma-nivāsī,</em> and those who live in the forest are called <em>vana-vāsī</em> or <em>vānaprastha.</em> The <em>vānaprasthas,</em> who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well (<em>hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpam</em>). If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to <em>vana,</em> the forest. When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a <em>vānaprastha,</em> he should accept <em>sannyāsa.</em> <em>Vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta. Sannyāsa</em> means accepting unalloyed engagement in the service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life — <em>brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</em> and <em>sannyāsa.</em> One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely <em>vānaprastha</em> and <em>sannyāsa.</em></p>

<h3 id="purport-1">Purport</h3>
<p>Here Mahārāja Yayāti compares himself to a he-goat and Devayānī to a she-goat and describes the nature of man and woman. Like a he-goat, a man searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and a woman without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that has fallen into a well. Without being cared for by a man, a woman cannot be happy. Indeed, she is just like a she-goat that has fallen into a well and is struggling for existence. Therefore a woman must take shelter of her father, as Devayānī did when under the care of Śukrācārya, and then the father must give the daughter in charity to a suitable man, or a suitable man should help the woman by placing her under the care of a husband. This is shown vividly by the life of Devayānī. When King Yayāti delivered Devayānī from the well, she felt great relief and requested Yayāti to accept her as his wife. But when Mahārāja Yayāti accepted Devayānī, he became too attached and had sex life not only with her but with others, like Śarmiṣṭhā. Yet still he was dissatisfied. Therefore one should retire by force from such family life as Yayāti’s. When one is fully convinced of the degrading nature of worldly family life, one should completely renounce this way of life, take <em>sannyāsa,</em> and engage himself fully in the service of the Lord. Then one’s life will be successful.</p>

Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was a laborious task, but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent this labor. <em>Aho gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho ’yam ahaṁ mameti.</em> The union between male and female provides the impetus for gaining a nice apartment, a good income, children and friends. Thus one becomes entangled in this material world.</p>

<p><strong>When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she desired to accept him as her husband.

Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.</strong></p>

<p>Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. <em>Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham</em>. Although one becomes a <em>gṛhastha,</em> or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart’s content, one is never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for self-realization.</p>
<p><em>tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ<br>
śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam</em></p>
<p>Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (<em>dehino ’smin yathā dehe</em>). A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body. However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily concept of life.</p>

<p>The word <em>svāminam</em> is significant. <em>Svāmī</em> means “caretaker” or “master.” Devayānī was cared for by Śukrācārya before her marriage, and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayāti, but here the word <em>svāminam</em> indicates that Devayānī left the protection of her husband, Yayāti, and returned to her former protector, Śukrācārya. Vedic civilization recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man. During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a grown son. In any stage of life, a woman should not have independence.</p>

<h3 id="purport-5">Purport</h3>
<p>Here Śukrācārya is figuratively described as the husband of another she-goat. This indicates that the relationship between husband and wife in any society, whether higher or lower than human society, is nothing but the same relationship between he-goat and she-goat, for the material relationship between man and woman is one of sex. <em>Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham</em>. Śukrācārya was an <em>ācārya,</em> or expert, in family affairs, which involve the transfer of semen from he-goat to she-goat. The words <em>kaścid ajā-svāmī</em> expressly indicate herein that Śukrācārya was no better than Yayāti, for both of them were interested in family affairs generated by <em>śukra,</em> or semen. Śukrācārya first cursed Yayāti to become old so that he could no longer indulge in sex, but when Śukrācārya saw that Yayāti’s emasculation would make his own daughter a victim of punishment, he used his mystic power to restore Yayāti’s masculinity. Because he used his power of mystic <em>yoga</em> for family affairs and not to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this exercise in the magic of <em>yoga</em> was no better than the affairs of he-goats and she-goats. Yogic power should properly be used to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself recommends in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (6.47):</p>
<p><em>yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br>

If one wants relief from the miserable condition of material life, one must voluntarily give up his lusty relationship with his wife; otherwise there is no question of self-realization. Unless one is extremely advanced in spiritual consciousness, household life is nothing but a dark well in which one commits suicide. Prahlāda Mahārāja therefore recommended that in due time, at least after one’s fiftieth year, one must give up household life and go to the forest. <em>Vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta</em>.

On the <em>brahma-bhūta</em> stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is no lamentation and no material hankering (<em>na śocati na kāṅkṣati</em>). As long as one lives in the material world, actions and reactions will continue, but when one is unaffected by such material actions and reactions, he is to be considered free from the danger of being victimized by material desires. The symptoms of those who are satiated with lusty desires are described in this verse. As explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, when one is not envious even of his enemy, does not expect honor from anyone, but instead desires all well-being even for his enemy, he is understood to be a <em>paramahaṁsa,</em> one who has fully subdued the lusty desires for sense gratification.</p>

<p>We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men who have reached more than eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and pay heavy fees to drink wine and associate with women. Although such men are too old to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased. Time deteriorates even the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the desires of his senses. Therefore, by the practice of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> one should give up his lusty desires. As explained by Śrī Yāmunācārya:</p>
<p><em>yadavadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde<br>

It may be said that one is liable to be attracted if he is not very advanced in civilized life; however, as specifically mentioned here, <em>vidvāṁsam api karṣati:</em> even if one is highly advanced, materially or spiritually, he may be attracted by lusty desires. The object of attraction may even be one’s mother, sister or daughter. Therefore, one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was most strict in such dealings, especially after He accepted the <em>sannyāsa</em> order. Indeed, no woman could come near Him to offer Him respect. Again, one is warned herewith that one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. A <em>brahmacārī</em> is forbidden even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens to be young. The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from the disciple of her husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of the spiritual master is young, a <em>brahmacārī</em> is forbidden to render service to her.</p>

<h3 id="translation-17">Translation</h3>
<p><strong>Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Free from the dualities of mental concoction and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with the animals.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purport-14">Purport</h3>
<p>To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one’s mind cannot be freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the forest. <em>Pañcāśordhvaṁ vanaṁ vrajet</em>. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and go to the forest. The best forest is Vṛndāvana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves Vṛndāvana. Cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Vṛndāvana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in Vṛndāvana one can automatically meditate upon Kṛṣṇa. Vṛndāvana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma and meditate upon this form. As expressed here by the words <em>brahmaṇy adhyāya,</em> one should concentrate one’s mind upon the Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Kṛṣṇa, as confirmed by Arjuna in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (<em>paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</em>). Kṛṣṇa and His abode, Vṛndāvana, are not different. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <em>ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam.</em> Vṛndāvana is as good as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, if one somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in Vṛndāvana, and if one is not a pretender but simply lives in Vṛndāvana and concentrates his mind upon Kṛṣṇa, one is liberated from material bondage. One’s mind is not purified, however, even in Vṛndāvana, if one is agitated by lusty desires. One should not live in Vṛndāvana and commit offenses, for a life of offenses in Vṛndāvana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs live in Vṛndāvana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires. Men who have gone to Vṛndāvana but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave Vṛndāvana and stop their grievous offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord. There are many misguided men who live in Vṛndāvana to satisfy their sexual desires, but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are under the control of <em>māyā,</em> and specifically under the control of lusty desires, are called <em>māyā-mṛga.</em> Indeed, everyone in the conditional stage of material life is a <em>māyā-mṛga.</em> It is said, <em>māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad:</em> Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took <em>sannyāsa</em> to show His causeless mercy to the <em>māyā-mṛgas,</em> the people of this material world, who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and always think of Kṛṣṇa in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then one will be eligible to live in Vṛndāvana, and his life will be successful.</p>

<p>The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his encagement. This is the beginning of spiritual understanding.</p>
<p><em>dehino ’smin yathā dehe<br>

<p>“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13) The real mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material body. Therefore Kṛṣṇa descends to teach the conditioned soul about spiritual realization and how to become free from material bondage. <em>Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata.</em> The words <em>dharmasya glāniḥ</em> mean “pollution of one’s existence.” Our existence is now polluted, and it must be purified (<em>sattvaṁ śuddhyet</em>). The human life is meant for this purification, not for thinking of happiness in terms of the external body, which is the cause of material bondage. Therefore, in this verse, Mahārāja Yayāti advises that whatever material happiness we see and whatever is promised for enjoyment is all merely flickering and temporary. <em>Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino ’rjuna.</em> Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, if one is not freed from material bondage one must return to this planet earth and continue in the miserable condition of material existence (<em>bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate</em>). One should always keep this understanding in mind so as not to be allured by any kind of sense enjoyment, in this life or in the next. One who is fully aware of this truth is self-realized (<em>sa ātma-dṛk</em>), but aside from him, everyone suffers in the cycle of birth and death (<em>mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani</em>). This understanding is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to this is but a cause of unhappiness. <em>Kṛṣṇa-bhakta</em> — <em>niṣkāma, ataeva ‘śānta.</em>’ Only a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, who knows the aim and object of life, is peaceful. All others, whether <em>karmīs, jñānīs</em> or <em>yogīs,</em> are restless and cannot enjoy real peace.</p>

<p>That Mahārāja Yayāti was immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life is certainly astonishing. But the example given herewith is appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly, if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (<em>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</em>). As stated in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (2.4.18):</p>
<p><em>kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā<br>
ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ<br>

<p>“Kirāta, Hūṇa, Āndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana and the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.” Lord Viṣṇu is so powerful that He can deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, can be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Mahārāja Yayāti did. Mahārāja Yayāti was eager to serve Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce material life, Lord Vāsudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life. This is clearly expressed in the next verse.</p>

<h3 id="purport-17">Purport</h3>
<p>The word <em>vidhuta,</em> meaning “cleansed,” is very significant. Everyone in this material world is contaminated (<em>kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo ’sya</em>). Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by <em>sattva-guṇa,</em> by <em>rajo-guṇa</em> or by <em>tamo-guṇa.</em> Even if one becomes a qualified <em>brāhmaṇa</em> in the mode of goodness (<em>sattva-guṇa</em>), he is still materially contaminated. One must come to the platform of <em>śuddha-sattva,</em> transcending the <em>sattva-guṇa.</em> Then one is <em>vidhuta-triliṅga,</em> cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature. This is possible by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> (1.2.17):</p>
<p><em>śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br>
puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ<br>

<p>“Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted.” A person trying to be perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious by hearing the words of Kṛṣṇa from <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> or <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> certainly has all the dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, <em>ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:</em> the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Mahārāja Yayāti was, one’s original position as an associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called <em>svarūpa-siddhi,</em> or personal perfection.</p>

<h3 id="purport-18">Purport</h3>
<p>When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his real position as an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa.

Under the influence of <em>māyā,</em> everyone living in this material world thinks that he is the master of everything (<em>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate</em>). One thinks that there is no God or controller and that one is independent and can do anything. This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this ignorance, he is called liberated. Mahārāja Yayāti had delivered Devayānī from the well, and finally, as a dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her from the misconception of material happiness.

<h3 id="translation-26">Translation</h3>
<p><strong>O Lord Vāsudeva, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation. You live as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart and are smaller than the smallest, yet You are greater than the greatest and are all-pervading. You appear completely silent, having nothing to do, but this is due to Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</strong></p>

<p>How Devayānī became self-realized by the grace of her great husband, Mahārāja Yayāti, is described here. Describing such realization is another way of performing the <em>bhakti</em> process.</p>
<p><em>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ<br>
smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam<br>
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ<br>
sakhyam ātma-nivedanam</em></p>
<p>“Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Viṣṇu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one’s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him — these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service.” (<em>Bhāg.</em> 7.5.23) <em>Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,</em> hearing and chanting, are especially important. By hearing from her husband about the greatness of Lord Vāsudeva, Devayānī certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto the lotus feet of the Lord (<em>oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya</em>). This is knowledge. <em>Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate.</em> Surrender to Vāsudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many births. As soon as one surrenders unto Vāsudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her association with her great husband, Mahārāja Yayāti, Devayānī became purified, adopted the means of <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> and thus became liberated.</p>
<p><em>Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the</em> Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, <em>entitled “King Yayāti Achieves Liberation.”</em></p>
