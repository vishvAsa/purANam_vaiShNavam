CHAPTER FIVE

In this chapter we find Mahārāja Ambarīṣa offering prayers to the Sudarśana *cakra* and we find how the Sudarśana *cakra* became merciful to Durvāsā Muni.

By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, Durvāsā Muni immediately went to Mahārāja Ambarīṣa and fell at his lotus feet. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and ashamed because Durvāsā Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to the Sudarśana *cakra* just to save Durvāsā. What is this Sudarśana *cakra*? The Sudarśana *cakra* is the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world. *Sa aikṣata, sa asṛjata.* This is the Vedic version. The Sudarśana *cakra,* which is the origin of creation and is most dear to the Lord, has thousands of spokes. This Sudarśana *cakra* is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his mercy, the universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarśana *cakra* is employed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Mahārāja Ambarīṣa thus prayed that the Sudarśana *cakra* be merciful, the Sudarśana *cakra,* being appeased, refrained from killing Durvāsā Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarśana *cakra’s* mercy. Durvāsā Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaiṣṇava an ordinary person (*vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhi*). Mahārāja Ambarīṣa belonged to the *kṣatriya* group, and therefore Durvāsā Muni considered him lower than the *brāhmaṇas* and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him. By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaiṣṇavas. After this incident, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa gave Durvāsā Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took *prasāda.* Mahārāja Ambarīṣa later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Mānasa-sarovara to execute devotional meditation.

### Purport

The word *sudarśana* means “auspicious vision.” From Vedic instructions we understand that this material world is created by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*sa aikṣata, sa asṛjata*). The Supreme Personality of Godhead glanced over the *mahat-tattva,* or the total material energy, and when it was agitated, everything came into existence. Western philosophers sometimes think that the original cause of creation was a chunk that exploded. If one thinks of this chunk as the total material energy, the *mahat-tattva,* one can understand that the chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and thus the Lord’s glance is the original cause of material creation.

I can simply utter the word “namaḥ,” offering all obeisances unto you.**

### Purport

The disc of the Lord is called Sudarśana because he does not discriminate between high and low criminals or demons. Durvāsā Muni was certainly a powerful *brāhmaṇa,* but his acts against the pure devotee Mahārāja Ambarīṣa were no better than the activities of *asuras.* As stated in the *śāstras, dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam:* the word *dharma* refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:* real *dharma* is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real *dharma* means *bhakti,* or devotional service to the Lord. The Sudarśana *cakra* is here addressed as *dharma-setave,* the protector of *dharma.* Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarśana *cakra* was ready to punish even such a strict *brāhmaṇa* as Durvāsā Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are demons even in the form of *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore the Sudarśana *cakra* does not discriminate between *brāhmaṇa* demons and *śūdra* demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon. In the *śāstras* we find many *brāhmaṇas* and *kṣatriyas* who acted as demons and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the *śāstras,* one has to be understood according to his symptoms. If one is born of a *brāhmaṇa* father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudarśana *cakra* is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is described as *adharma-śīlāsura-dhūma-ketave.* Those who are not devotees are called *adharma-śīla.* The Sudarśana *cakra* is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons.

tamaḥ prakāśaś ca dṛśo mahātmanām  
duratyayas te mahimā girāṁ pate

### Translation

**O master of speech, by your effulgence, full of religious principles, the darkness of the world is dissipated, and the knowledge of learned persons or great souls is manifested. Indeed, no one can surpass your effulgence, for all things, manifested and unmanifested, gross and subtle, superior and inferior, are but various forms of you that are manifested by your effulgence.**

### Purport

Without illumination, nothing can be seen, especially in this material world. The illumination in this world emanates from the effulgence of Sudarśana, the original vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illuminating principles of the sun, the moon and fire emanate from Sudarśana. Similarly, illumination by knowledge also comes from Sudarśana because with the illumination of Sudarśana one can distinguish one thing from another, the superior from the inferior. Generally people accept a powerful *yogī* like Durvāsā Muni as wonderfully superior, but if such a person is chased by the Sudarśana *cakra,* we can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is because of his dealings with devotees.

### Synonyms

*prītaḥ* — very much satisfied; *asmi* — I am; *anugṛhītaḥ* — very much favored; *asmi* — I am; *tava* — your; *bhāgavatasya* — because of your being a pure devotee; *vai* — indeed; *darśana* — by seeing you; *sparśana* — and touching your feet; *ālāpaiḥ* — by talking with you; *ātithyena* — by your hospitality; *ātma*-*medhasā* — by my own intelligence.

### Translation

**Durvāsā Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King. At first I thought of you as an ordinary human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.**

### Purport

It is said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaiṣṇava. Therefore, although Durvāsā Muni was a great mystic *yogī,* he first mistook Mahārāja Ambarīṣa for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaiṣṇava. When Durvāsā Muni was persecuted by the Sudarśana *cakra,* however, his intelligence developed. Therefore the word *ātma-medhasā* is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vaiṣṇava the King was. When Durvāsā Muni was chased by the Sudarśana *cakra,* he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarśana *cakra.* Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaiṣṇava by personal experience. Durvāsā Muni was certainly a great *yogī* and a very learned *brāhmaṇa,* but despite his being a real *yogī* he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore it is said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā mudrā vijñeha nā bujhaya:* even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaiṣṇava. There is always a possibility for so-called *jñānīs* and *yogīs* to be mistaken when studying the character of a Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *evam* — thus; *saṅkīrtya* — glorifying; *rājānam* — the King; *durvāsāḥ* — the great mystic *yogī* Durvāsā Muni; *paritoṣitaḥ* — being satisfied in all respects; *yayau* — left that place; *vihāyasā* — by the spaceways; *āmantrya* — taking permission; *brahmalokam* — to the topmost planet of this universe; *ahaitukam* — where there is no dry philosophical speculation.

### Translation

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Thus being satisfied in all respects, the great mystic yogī Durvāsā took permission and left, continuously glorifying the King. Through the skyways, he went to Brahmaloka, which is devoid of agnostics and dry philosophical speculators.**

### Purport

Although Durvāsā Muni went back to Brahmaloka through the spaceways, he did not need an airplane, for great mystic *yogīs* can transport themselves from any planet to any other without any machine. There is a planet named Siddhaloka whose inhabitants can go to any other planet because they naturally have all the perfection of *yoga* practice. Thus Durvāsā Muni, the great mystic *yogī,* could go through the skyways to any planet, even to Brahmaloka. In Brahmaloka, everyone is self-realized, and thus there is no need of philosophical speculation to come to the conclusion of the Absolute Truth. Durvāsā Muni’s purpose in going to Brahmaloka was apparently to speak to the residents of Brahmaloka about how powerful a devotee is and how a devotee can surpass every living entity within this material world. The so-called *jñānīs* and *yogīs* cannot compare to a devotee.

### Translation

**After one year, when Durvāsā Muni had returned, King Ambarīṣa sumptuously fed him all varieties of pure food, and then he himself also ate. When the King saw that the brāhmaṇa Durvāsā had been released from the great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been done by the Lord.**

### Purport

A devotee like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa is certainly always busy in many activities. Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. He was the emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were many disturbances created by persons like Durvāsā Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently depending fully on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord, however, is situated in everyone’s heart (*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ*), and He manages things as He desires. Thus although Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end Durvāsā Muni and Mahārāja Ambarīṣa became great friends and parted cordially on the basis of *bhakti-yoga.* After all, Durvāsā Muni was convinced of the power of *bhakti-yoga,* although he himself was a great mystic *yogī.* Therefore, as stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.47):

*yoginām api sarveṣāṁ  
mad-gatenāntarātmanā  
śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ  
sa me yuktatamo mataḥ*

“Of all *yogīs,* he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in *yoga* and is the highest of all.” Thus it is a fact that a devotee is the topmost *yogī,* as proved in the dealings of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa with Durvāsā Muni.

### Translation

**In this way, because of devotional service, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, who was endowed with varieties of transcendental qualities, was completely aware of Brahman, Paramātmā and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus he executed devotional service perfectly. Because of his devotion, he thought even the topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.**

### Purport

An exalted and pure devotee like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa is in full awareness of Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān; in other words, a devotee of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is in full knowledge of the other features of the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features — Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān (*brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate*). A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, knows everything (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti*) because Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, includes both Paramātmā and Brahman. One does not have to realize Paramātmā by the *yoga* system, for the devotee always thinking of Vāsudeva is the topmost *yogī* (*yoginām api sarveṣām*). And as far as *jñāna* is concerned, if one is a perfect devotee of Vāsudeva, he is the greatest *mahātmā* (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ*). A *mahātmā* is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thus Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, being a devotee of the Personality of Godhead, was in full awareness of Paramātmā, Brahman, *māyā,* the material world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere. Everything was known to him. *Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.* Because the devotee knows Vāsudeva, he knows everything within the creation of Vāsudeva (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ*). Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of happiness within this material world.

*nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve  
na kutaścana bibhyati  
svargāpavarga-narakeṣv  
api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ*

(*Bhāg.* 6.17.28)

Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any position in the material world as important. Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has therefore written (*Caitanya-candrāmṛta* 5):

*kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate  
durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate  
viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate  
yat-kāruṇya-katākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ*

For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great personalities like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, *kaivalya,* or merging into Brahman, appears no better than hell. As far as the heavenly planets are concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o’-the-wisp, and as far as yogic perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee. This is all possible when one becomes a devotee of the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s instructions.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Thereafter, because of his advanced position in devotional life, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, who no longer desired to live with material things, retired from active family life. He divided his property among his sons, who were equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of vānaprastha and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord Vāsudeva.**

### Purport

As a pure devotee, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was liberated in any condition of life because, as enunciated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, a devotee is always liberated.

*īhā yasya harer dāsye  
karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu  
jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

In *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī thus instructs that if one’s only desire is service to the Lord, he is liberated in any condition of life. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was undoubtedly liberated in any condition, but as an ideal king he accepted the *vānaprastha* order of retirement from family life. It is essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Vāsudeva. Therefore Mahārāja Ambarīṣa divided the kingdom among his sons and retired from family life.

### Translation

**Anyone who chants this narration or even thinks of this narration about the activities of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa certainly becomes a pure devotee of the Lord.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura herein gives a very good example. When one is very eager for more and more money, he is not satisfied even when he is a millionaire or a multimillionaire, but wants to earn more and more money by any means. The same mentality is present in a devotee. The devotee is never satisfied, thinking, “This is the limit of my devotional service.” The more he engages in the service of the Lord, the more service he wants to give. This is the position of a devotee. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, in his family life, was certainly a pure devotee, complete in every respect, because his mind and all his senses were engaged in devotional service (*sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane*). Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was self-satisfied because all of his senses were engaged in devotional service (*sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam/ hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate*). Nonetheless, although Mahārāja Ambarīṣa had engaged all his senses in devotional service, he left his home and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, exactly as a mercantile man, even though complete in wealth, tries to earn more and more. This mentality of getting more and more engaged in devotional service puts one in the most exalted position. Whereas on the *karma* platform the mercantile man who wants more and more money becomes increasingly bound and entangled, the devotee becomes increasingly liberated.
