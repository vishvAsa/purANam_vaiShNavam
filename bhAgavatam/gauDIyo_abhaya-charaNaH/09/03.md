CHAPTER THREE

This chapter describes the dynasty of Śaryāti, another son of Manu, and also tells about Sukanyā and Revatī.

Devajña Śaryāti gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second day of the *yajña* of the Aṅgirasas. One day, Śaryāti, along with his daughter, known as Sukanyā, went to the *āśrama* of Cyavana Muni. There Sukanyā saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances. As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole. Consequently, King Śaryāti and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine. When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanyā was the cause of this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajña Śaryāti offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.

When the heavenly physicians the Aśvinī-kumāra brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the *muni* requested them to give him back his youth. These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in which they bathed and regained full youth. After this, Sukanyā could not distinguish her husband. She then surrendered unto the Aśvinī-kumāras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her husband. Cyavana Muni then engaged King Śaryāti in performing the *soma-yajña* and gave the Aśvinī-kumāras the privilege to drink *soma-rasa.* The King of heaven, Lord Indra, became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Śaryāti. Henceforward, the Aśvinī-kumāra physicians were able to share in the *soma-rasa.*

Śaryāti later had three sons, named Uttānabarhi, Ānarta and Bhūriṣeṇa. Ānarta had one son, whose name was Revata. Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmī. Kakudmī was advised by Lord Brahmā to offer his beautiful daughter, Revatī, to Baladeva, who belongs to the *viṣṇu-tattva* category. After doing this, Kakudmī retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikāśrama to execute austerities and penances.

Thus with the permission of the great sage the King returned home.

सुकन्या च्यवनं प्राप्य पतिं परमकोपनम् ।  
प्रीणयामास चित्तज्ञा अप्रमत्तानुवृत्तिभि- ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*sukanyā cyavanaṁ prāpya  
patiṁ parama-kopanam  
prīṇayām āsa citta-jñā  
apramattānuvṛttibhiḥ*

### Synonyms

*sukanyā* — the girl named Sukanyā, the daughter of King Śaryāti; *cyavanam* — the great sage Cyavana Muni; *prāpya* — after obtaining; *patim* — as her husband; *parama*-*kopanam* — who was always very angry; *prīṇayām* *āsa* — she satisfied him; *citta*-*jñā* — understanding the mind of her husband; *apramattā* *anuvṛttibhiḥ* — by executing services without being bewildered.

### Translation

**Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanyā had gotten him as her husband, she dealt with him carefully, according to his mood. Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without being bewildered.**

### Purport

This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A great personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to anyone. Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife, Sukanyā, could understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her husband, she must try to understand her husband’s temperament and please him. This is victory for a woman. Even in the dealings of Lord Kṛṣṇa with His different queens, it has been seen that although the queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Kṛṣṇa as His maidservants. However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she must be ready to carry out her husband’s orders and please him in all circumstances. Then her life will be successful. When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately completely broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws. According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be trained to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however irritable or cruel he may be. In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not young but indeed old enough to be Sukanyā’s grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanyā, the beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all respects. Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.

### Verse text

*kasyacit tv atha kālasya  
nāsatyāv āśramāgatau  
tau pūjayitvā provāca  
vayo me dattam īśvarau*

### Synonyms

*kasyacit* — after some (time); *tu* — but; *atha* — in this way; *kālasya* — time having passed; *nāsatyau* — the two Aśvinī-kumāras; *āśrama* — that place of Cyavana Muni; *āgatau* — reached; *tau* — unto those two; *pūjayitvā* — offering respectful obeisances; *provāca* — said; *vayaḥ* — youth; *me* — unto me; *dattam* — please give; *īśvarau* — because you two are able to do so.

### Translation

**Thereafter, some time having passed, the Aśvinī-kumāra brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to come to Cyavana Muni’s āśrama. After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them to give him youthful life, for they were able to do so.**

### Purport

The heavenly physicians like the Aśvinī-kumāras could give youthful life even to one who was advanced in age. Indeed, great *yogīs,* with their mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the structure of the body is in order. We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Mahārāja’s soldiers and their treatment by Śukrācārya. Modern medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a dead body back to life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we can understand that such treatment is possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information. The Aśvinī-kumāras were expert in *Āyur-veda,* as was Dhanvantari. In every department of material science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection is to become a devotee of the Lord. To attain this perfection, one must consult *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* which is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire tree (*nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam*).

Sukanyā could have selected any one of them as her husband, for one could not distinguish among them, but because she was chaste, she took shelter of the Aśvinī-kumāras so that they could inform her who her actual husband was. A chaste woman will never accept any man other than her husband, even if there be someone equally as handsome and qualified.

**O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You have cheated the most respectable husband, who is honored by everyone, for I see that because he was old, diseased and therefore unattractive, you have left his company to accept as your husband this young man, who appears to be a beggar from the street.**

### Purport

This shows the values of Vedic culture. According to the circumstances, Sukanyā had been given a husband who was too old to be compatible with her. Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he was certainly unfit for the beautiful daughter of King Śaryāti. Nonetheless, her father expected her to be faithful to her husband. When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else, even though the man was young and handsome, he immediately chastised her as *asatī,* unchaste, because he assumed that she had accepted another man in the presence of her husband. According to Vedic culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully serve him. This is chastity. It is not that because she dislikes her husband she may give him up and accept another. This is against Vedic culture. According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her parents and remain chaste and faithful to him. Therefore King Śaryāti was surprised to see a young man by the side of Sukanyā.

kula-prasūte kula-dūṣaṇaṁ tv idam

### Synonyms

*katham* — how; *matiḥ* *te* — your consciousness; *avagatā* — has gone down; *anyathā* — otherwise; *satām* — of the most respectable; *kula*-*prasūte* — O my daughter, born in the family; *kula*-*dūṣaṇam* — who are the degradation of the family; *tu* — but; *idam* — this; *bibharṣi* — you are maintaining; *jāram* — a paramour; *yat* — as it is; *apatrapā* — without shame; *kulam* — the dynasty; *pituḥ* — of your father; *ca* — and; *bhartuḥ* — of your husband; *ca* — and; *nayasi* — you are bringing down; *adhaḥ* *tamaḥ* — downward into darkness or hell.

### Translation

**O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in this way? How is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties of both your father and your husband to hellish life.**

### Purport

It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father’s family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* even today; only the *śūdras* are degraded in this matter. For a woman of the *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Śaryāti, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni’s transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.

### Translation

**Sukanyā, however, being very proud of her chastity, smiled upon hearing the rebukes of her father. She smilingly told him, “My dear father, this young man by my side is your actual son-in-law, the great sage Cyavana, who was born in the family of Bhṛgu.”**

### Purport

Although the father chastised the daughter, assuming that she had accepted another husband, the daughter knew that she was completely honest and chaste, and therefore she was smiling. When she explained that her husband, Cyavana Muni, had now been transformed into a young man, she was very proud of her chastity, and thus she smiled as she talked with her father.
