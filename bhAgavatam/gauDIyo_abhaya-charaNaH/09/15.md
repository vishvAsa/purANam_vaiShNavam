CHAPTER FIFTEEN

This chapter describes the history of Gādhi in the dynasty of Aila.

From the womb of Urvaśī came six sons, named Āyu, Śrutāyu, Satyāyu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son of Śrutāyu was Vasumān, the son of Satyāyu was Śrutañjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhīma. Bhīma’s son was named Kāñcana, the son of Kāñcana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balāka, Ajaka and Kuśa. The sons of Kuśa were Kuśāmbu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kuśanābha. From Kuśāmbu came Gādhi, who had a daughter named Satyavatī. Satyavatī married Ṛcīka Muni after the *muni* contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavatī by Ṛcīka Muni, Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Rāma, or Paraśurāma. When a king named Kārtavīryārjuna stole Jamadagni’s desire cow, Paraśurāma, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a *saktyāveśa* incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kārtavīryārjuna. Later, he annihilated the *kṣatriya* dynasty twenty-one times. After Paraśurāma killed Kārtavīryārjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a *brāhmaṇa* he should have tolerated the offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised Paraśurāma to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places.

### Translation

**King Gādhi had a daughter named Satyavatī, whom a brāhmaṇa sage named Ṛcīka requested from the King to be his wife. King Gādhi, however, regarded Ṛcīka as an unfit husband for his daughter, and therefore he told the brāhmaṇa, “My dear sir, I belong to the dynasty of Kuśa. Because we are aristocratic kṣatriyas, you have to give some dowry for my daughter. Therefore, bring at least one thousand horses, each as brilliant as moonshine and each having one black ear, whether right or left.”**

### Purport

The son of King Gādhi was Viśvāmitra, who was said to be a *brāhmaṇa* and *kṣatriya* combined. Viśvāmitra attained the status of a *brahmarṣi,* as explained later. From the marriage of Satyavatī with Ṛcīka Muni would come a son with the spirit of a *kṣatriya.* King Gādhi demanded that an uncommon request be fulfilled before the *brāhmaṇa* Ṛcīka could marry his daughter.

### Devanagari

तावत् सत्यवती मात्रा स्वचरुं याचिता सती ।

### Verse text

*tāvat satyavatī mātrā  
sva-caruṁ yācitā satī  
śreṣṭhaṁ matvā tayāyacchan  
mātre mātur adat svayam*

### Translation

**Meanwhile, because Satyavatī’s mother thought that the oblation prepared for her daughter, Ṛcīka’s wife, must be better, she asked her daughter for that oblation. Satyavatī therefore gave her own oblation to her mother and ate her mother’s oblation herself.**

### Purport

A husband naturally has some affection for his wife. Therefore Satyavatī’s mother thought that the oblation prepared for Satyavatī by the sage Ṛcīka must have been better than her own oblation. In Ṛcīka’s absence, the mother took the better oblation from Satyavatī and ate it.

### Devanagari

तद् विदित्वा मुनि- प्राह पत्नीं कष्टमकारषी- ।  
घोरो दण्डधर- पुत्रो भ्राता ते ब्रह्मवित्तम- ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*tad viditvā muniḥ prāha  
patnīṁ kaṣṭam akāraṣīḥ  
ghoro daṇḍa-dharaḥ putro  
bhrātā te brahma-vittamaḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat* — this fact; *viditvā* — having learned; *muniḥ* — the great sage; *prāha* — said; *patnīm* — unto his wife; *kaṣṭam* — very regrettable; *akāraṣīḥ* — you have done; *ghoraḥ* — fierce; *daṇḍa*-*dharaḥ* — a great personality who can punish others; *putraḥ* — such a son; *bhrātā* — brother; *te* — your; *brahma*-*vittamaḥ* — a learned scholar in spiritual science.

### Translation

**When the great sage Ṛcīka returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife, Satyavatī, “You have done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce kṣatriya, able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science.”**

### Purport

A *brāhmaṇa* is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving. A *kṣatriya,* however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.42-43). Because Satyavatī, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she would give birth to a son imbued with the *kṣatriya* spirit. This was undesirable. The son of a *brāhmaṇa* is generally expected to become a *brāhmaṇa,* but if such a son becomes fierce like a *kṣatriya,* he is designated according to the description of the four *varṇas* in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ*). If the son of a *brāhmaṇa* does not become like a *brāhmaṇa,* he may be called a *kṣatriya, vaiśya* or *śūdra,* according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing society is not a person’s birth but his qualities and actions.

### Translation

**Satyavatī, however, pacified Ṛcīka Muni with peaceful words and requested that her son not be like a fierce kṣatriya. Ṛcīka Muni replied, “Then your grandson will be of a kṣatriya spirit.” Thus Jamadagni was born as the son of Satyavatī.**

### Purport

The great sage Ṛcīka was very angry, but somehow or other Satyavatī pacified him, and at her request he changed his mind. It is indicated here that the son of Jamadagni would be born as Paraśurāma.

द‍ृप्तं क्षत्रं भुवो भारमब्रह्मण्यमनीनशत् ।

### Verse text

*dṛptaṁ kṣatraṁ bhuvo bhāram  
abrahmaṇyam anīnaśat  
rajas-tamo-vṛtam ahan  
phalguny api kṛte ’ṁhasi*

### Synonyms

*dṛptam* — very proud; *kṣatram* — the *kṣatriyas,* the ruling class; *bhuvaḥ* — of the earth; *bhāram* — burden; *abrahmaṇyam* — sinful, not caring for the religious principles enunciated by the *brāhmaṇas*; *anīnaśat* — drove away or annihilated; *rajaḥ*-*tamaḥ* — by the qualities of passion and ignorance; *vṛtam* — covered; *ahan* — he killed; *phalguni* — not very great; *api* — although; *kṛte* — had been committed; *aṁhasi* — an offense.

### Translation

**When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brāhmaṇas, Paraśurāma killed them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.**

### Purport

The *kṣatriyas,* or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by great *brāhmaṇas* and saintly persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, *rajas-tamo-vṛtaṁ, bhāram abrahmaṇyam:* when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power. We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded. When the government is actually guided by *brāhmaṇas,* or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people. Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the *brāhmaṇas,* headed by such a *kṣatriya-*spirited *brāhmaṇa* as Paraśurāma, killed them twenty-one consecutive times.

In Kali-yuga, as stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.2.13), *dasyu-prāyeṣu rājasu:* the ruling class (*rājanya*) will be no better than plunderers (*dasyus*) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize the affairs of the government. Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations, they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration. As stated elsewhere in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.1.40):

*asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā-hīnā  
rajasā tamasāvṛtāḥ  
prajās te bhakṣayiṣyanti  
mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ*

Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of passion (*rajas*) and ignorance (*tamas*), unclean people (*mlecchas*), posing as members of the government (*rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ*), will swallow the citizens (*prājas te bhakṣayiṣyanti*). And in still another place, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.2.7-8) says:

*evaṁ prajābhir duṣṭābhir  
ākīrṇe kṣiti-maṇḍale  
brahma-viṭ-kṣatra-śūdrāṇāṁ  
yo balī bhavitā nṛpaḥ*

*prajā hi lubdhai rājanyair  
nirghṛṇair dasyu-dharmabhiḥ  
ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā  
yāsyanti giri-kānanam*

Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ*). But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not considered, the result will be *brahma-viṭ-kṣatra-śūdrāṇāṁ yo balī bhavitā nṛpaḥ:* the so-called caste system of *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the *prajās,* or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (*yāsyanti giri-kānanam*) to escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers. Therefore the *prajās,* or the people in general, must take to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Kali-kāle nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra:* Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. Therefore, when the *prajās* become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence.

### Synonyms

*tasmai* — unto him; *saḥ* — he (Jamadagni); *naradevāya* — unto King Kārtavīryārjuna; *muniḥ* — the great sage; *arhaṇam* — paraphernalia for worship; *āharat* — offered; *sa*-*sainya* — with his soldiers; *amātya* — his ministers; *vāhāya* — and the chariots, the elephants, the horses or the men who carried the palanquins; *haviṣmatyā* — because of possessing a *kāmadhenu,* a cow that could supply everything; *tapaḥ*-*dhanaḥ* — the great sage, whose only power was his austerity, or who was engaged in austerity.

### Translation

**The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the forest, received the King very well, along with the King’s soldiers, ministers and carriers. He supplied all the necessities to worship these guests, for he possessed a kāmadhenu cow that was able to supply everything.**

### Purport

The *Brahma-saṁhitā* informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vṛndāvana, where Kṛṣṇa lives, is full of *surabhi* cows (*surabhīr abhipālayantam*). The *surabhi* cow is also called *kāmadhenu.* Although Jamadagni possessed only one *kāmadhenu,* he was able to get from it everything desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King’s great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King’s followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the beginning of his offense. Paraśurāma, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kārtavīryārjuna because Kārtavīryārjuna was too proud. One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Paraśurāma became angry at Kārtavīryārjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of *kṣatriyas* twenty-one times.

### Verse text

*sa vai ratnaṁ tu tad dṛṣṭvā  
ātmaiśvaryātiśāyanam  
tan nādriyatāgnihotryāṁ  
sābhilāṣaḥ sahaihayaḥ*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — he (Kārtavīryārjuna); *vai* — indeed; *ratnam* — a great source of wealth; *tu* — indeed; *tat* — the *kāmadhenu* in the possession of Jamadagni; *dṛṣṭvā* — by observing; *ātma*-*aiśvarya* — his own personal opulence; *ati*-*śāyanam* — which was exceeding; *tat* — that; *na* — not; *ādriyata* — appreciated very much; *agnihotryām* — in that cow, which was useful for executing the *agnihotra* sacrifice; *sa*-*abhilāṣaḥ* — became desirous; *sa*-*haihayaḥ* — with his own men, the Haihayas.

### Translation

**Kārtavīryārjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy than himself because of possessing a jewel in the form of the kāmadhenu. Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not very much appreciative of Jamadagni’s reception. On the contrary, they wanted to possess that kāmadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.**

### Purport

Jamadagni was more powerful than Kārtavīryārjuna because of performing the *agnihotra-yajña* with clarified butter received from the *kāmadhenu.* Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow. Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and ghee, especially for performing the *agnihotra-yajña.* This is possible for everyone. Thus we find that in *Bhagavad-gītā* Lord Kṛṣṇa advises *go-rakṣya,* the protection of cows. This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely supply sufficient milk. We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk. In other farms the cows do not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this instruction given by Lord Kṛṣṇa — *go-rakṣya* — is extremely meaningful. The whole world must learn from Kṛṣṇa how to live happily without scarcity simply by producing food grains (*annād bhavanti bhūtāni*) and giving protection to the cows (*go-rakṣya*). *Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāvajam.* Those who belong to the third level of human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving protection to cows. This is the injunction of *Bhagavad-gītā.* In the matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Kṛṣṇa gives stress to cow protection, those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement of human society.

*haviḥ*-*dhānīm* — the *kāmadhenu*; *ṛṣeḥ* — of the great sage Jamadagni; *darpāt* — because of his being puffed up with material power; *narān* — all his men (soldiers); *hartum* — to steal or take away; *acodayat* — encouraged; *te* — the men of Kārtavīryārjuna; *ca* — also; *māhiṣmatīm* — to the capital of Kārtavīryārjuna; *ninyuḥ* — brought; *sa*-*vatsām* — with the calf; *krandatīm* — crying; *balāt* — because of being taken away by force.

### Translation

**Being puffed up by material power, Kārtavīryārjuna encouraged his men to steal Jamadagni’s kāmadhenu. Thus the men forcibly took away the crying kāmadhenu, along with her calf, to Māhiṣmatī, Kārtavīryārjuna’s capital.**

### Purport

The word *havirdhānīm* is significant in this verse. *Havirdhānīm* refers to a cow required for supplying *havis,* or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be trained to perform *yajñas.* As we are informed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.9), *yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:* if we do not perform *yajña,* we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A human being should be trained to perform *yajña.* *Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ.* If *yajñas* are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life. *Yajña,* therefore, is essential. For performing *yajña,* clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer. So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of *prakṛti,* nature (*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ*). Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (*ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate*). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. *Yajñe sukhena bhavantu.*

### Purport

Different personalities become beautiful by possessing different qualities. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says that the cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful when he becomes a learned scholar. In the same way, *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas* and *śūdras* become beautiful by their qualities. *Brāhmaṇas* are beautiful when they are forgiving, *kṣatriyas* when they are heroic and never retreat from fighting, *vaiśyas* when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and *śūdras* when they are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters. Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his special qualities. And the special quality of the *brāhmaṇa,* as described here, is forgiveness.

राज्ञो मूर्धाभिषिक्तस्य वधो ब्रह्मवधाद् गुरु- ।

### Verse text

*rājño mūrdhābhiṣiktasya  
vadho brahma-vadhād guruḥ  
tīrtha-saṁsevayā cāṁho  
jahy aṅgācyuta-cetanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*rājñaḥ* — of the king; *mūrdha*-*abhiṣiktasya* — who is noted as the emperor; *vadhaḥ* — the killing; *brahma*-*vadhāt* — than killing a *brāhmaṇa*; *guruḥ* — more severe; *tīrtha*-*saṁsevayā* — by worshiping the holy places; *ca* — also; *aṁhaḥ* — the sinful act; *jahi* — wash out; *aṅga* — O my dear son; *acyuta*-*cetanaḥ* — being fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.

### Translation

**My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely sinful than killing a brāhmaṇa. But now, if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious and worship the holy places, you can atone for this great sin.**

### Purport

One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed from all sins (*ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi*). From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, even the most sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Paraśurāma to worship the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be released from sinful reactions.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Paraśurāma, the Lord’s Warrior Incarnation.”*
