CHAPTER FOURTEEN

The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Bṛhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Purūravā, who begot six sons, headed by Āyu, in the womb of Urvaśī.

Lord Brahmā was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Brahmā had a son named Atri, and Atri’s son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tārā, who was the wife of Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the *asuras,* but Brahmā rescued Bṛhaspati’s wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tārā, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ilā a son named Aila, or Purūravā. Urvaśī was captivated by Purūravā’s beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While traveling all over the world, he met Urvaśī again at Kurukṣetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year.

One year later, Purūravā saw Urvaśī at Kurukṣetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. Urvaśī then advised Purūravā to worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Purūravā, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisthālī. Purūravā mistook Agnisthālī for Urvaśī, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and meditating upon Urvaśī all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire. Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthālī, and there he saw that from the womb of a *śamī* tree had come an *aśvattha* tree. Purūravā made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Purūravā. In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called *haṁsa;* there were no divisions of *varṇa* like *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra.* The *Veda* was the *oṁkāra.* The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.

तस्य द‍ृग्भ्योऽभवत् पुत्र- सोमोऽमृतमय- किल ।

### Verse text

*tasya dṛgbhyo ’bhavat putraḥ  
somo ’mṛtamayaḥ kila  
viprauṣadhy-uḍu-gaṇānāṁ  
brahmaṇā kalpitaḥ patiḥ*

### Synonyms

*tasya* — of him, Atri, the son of Brahmā; *dṛgbhyaḥ* — from the tears of jubilation from the eyes; *abhavat* — was born; *putraḥ* — a son; *somaḥ* — the moon-god; *amṛta*-*mayaḥ* — full of soothing rays; *kila* — indeed; *vipra* — of the *brāhmaṇas*; *oṣadhi* — of the drugs; *uḍu*-*gaṇānām* — and of the luminaries; *brahmaṇā* — by Lord Brahmā; *kalpitaḥ* — was appointed or designated; *patiḥ* — the supreme director.

### Translation

**From Atri’s tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who was full of soothing rays. Lord Brahmā appointed him the director of the brāhmaṇas, drugs and luminaries.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*candramā manaso jātaḥ*). But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, *dṛgbhya ānandāśrubhya ata evāmṛtamayaḥ:* “Here the word *dṛgbhyaḥ* means ‘from tears of jubilation.’ Therefore the moon-god is called *amṛtamayaḥ,* ‘full of soothing rays.’” In the Fourth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (4.1.15) we find this verse:

*atreḥ patny anasūyā trīñ  
jajñe suyaśasaḥ sutān  
dattaṁ durvāsasaṁ somam  
ātmeśa-brahma-sambhavān*

This verse describes that Anasūyā, the wife of Atri Ṛṣi, bore three sons — Soma, Durvāsā and Dattātreya. It is said that at the time of conception Anasūyā was impregnated by the tears of Atri.

### Purport

The moon-god is one of the demigods, but to fight against the other demigods he took the assistance of the demons. Śukra, being an enemy of Bṛhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against Bṛhaspati. To counteract this situation, Lord Śiva, who was affectionate toward Bṛhaspati, joined Bṛhaspati. The father of Bṛhaspati was Aṅgirā, from whom Lord Śiva had received knowledge. Therefore Lord Śiva had some affection for Bṛhaspati and joined his side in this fight. Śrīdhara Svāmī remarks, *aṅgirasaḥ sakāśāt prāpta-vidyo hara iti prasiddhaḥ:* “Lord Śiva is well known to have received knowledge from Aṅgirā.”

Be assured that after the child is delivered, I shall not burn you to ashes. I know that although you are unchaste, you wanted a son. Therefore I shall not punish you.**

### Purport

Tārā was married to Bṛhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should have been impregnated by him. But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste. Although Bṛhaspati accepted Tārā from Brahmā, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted her to deliver a son immediately. Tārā certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might be punished after giving birth. Thus Bṛhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, he wanted a son.

When a beautiful man and a beautiful woman unite together and embrace one another, how within these three worlds can they check their sexual relationship? Therefore *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (7.9.45) says, *yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham.*

*etāv uraṇakau rājan  
nyāsau rakṣasva mānada  
saṁraṁsye bhavatā sākaṁ  
ślāghyaḥ strīṇāṁ varaḥ smṛtaḥ*

### Synonyms

*etau* — to these two; *uraṇakau* — lambs; *rājan* — O King Purūravā; *nyāsau* — who have fallen down; *rakṣasva* — please give protection; *māna*-*da* — O one who gives all honor to a guest or visitor; *saṁraṁsye* — I shall enjoy sexual union; *bhavatā* *sākam* — in your company; *ślāghyaḥ* — superior; *strīṇām* — of a woman; *varaḥ* — husband; *smṛtaḥ* — it is said.

### Translation

**My dear King Purūravā, please give protection to these two lambs, who have fallen down with me. Although I belong to the heavenly planets and you belong to earth, I shall certainly enjoy sexual union with you. I have no objection to accepting you as my husband, for you are superior in every respect.**

### Purport

As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.40), *yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam.* There are various planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The atmosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvaśī descended after being cursed by Mitra and Varuṇa was different from the atmosphere of this earth. Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvaśī agreed to remain the consort of Purūravā, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds a man with superior qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Śrī Cāṇakya Paṇḍita (*strī-ratnaṁ duṣkulād api*). The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities of both are on an equal level.

**Purūravā replied: O beautiful one, your beauty is wonderful and your gestures are also wonderful. Indeed, you are attractive to all human society. Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.**

### Purport

It appears from the words of Urvaśī that the standard of living, eating, behavior and speech are all different on the heavenly planets from the standards on this planet earth. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared in clarified butter. Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse. To live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked. Indeed, there are many clubs and societies for this purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets. The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well-behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness. These are some of the distinctions between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the inhabitants of earth.

### Translation

**Urvaśī said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don’t be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and don’t allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don’t let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox. There is no use making friendship with women.**

### Purport

Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has advised, *viśvāso naiva kartavyaḥ strīṣu rāja-kuleṣu ca:* “Never place your faith in a woman or a politician.” Unless elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen, what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have been compared to *śūdras* and *vaiśyas* (*striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ*). On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, *śūdra* or whatever, everyone is equal. Otherwise, Urvaśī, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman’s heart is like that of a sly fox. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home and go to the forest.

*mātā yasya gṛhe nāsti  
bhāryā cāpriya-vādinī  
araṇyaṁ tena gantavyaṁ  
yathāraṇyaṁ tathā gṛham*

(*Cāṇakya-śloka* 57)

Kṛṣṇa conscious *gṛhasthas* must be very careful of the sly fox woman. If the wife at home is obedient and follows her husband in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the home is welcome. Otherwise one should give up one’s home and go to the forest.

*hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpaṁ  
vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta*

(*Bhāg.* 7.5.5)

One should go to the forest and take shelter of the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Women as a class are merciless and cunning. They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. For their own pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or brother.**

### Purport

King Purūravā was greatly attached to Urvaśī. Yet despite his faithfulness to her, she had left him. Now, considering that the King was wasting his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvaśī frankly explained the nature of a woman. Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required. To say nothing of her husband, she can even kill her brother. That is a woman’s nature. Therefore, in the material world, unless women are trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in society.

### Translation

**Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted women give up the friendship of a man who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship among fools. Indeed, they seek newer and newer friends, one after another.**

### Purport

Because women are easily seduced, the *Manu-saṁhitā* enjoins that they should not be given freedom. A woman must always be protected, either by her father, by her husband, or by her elderly son. If women are given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep their propriety. The nature of a woman, as personally described by Urvaśī, is to establish false friendship with someone and then seek new male companions, one after another, even if this means giving up the company of a sincere well-wisher.

**O my dear King, you will be able to enjoy with me as my husband at the end of every year, for one night only. In this way you will have other children, one after another.**

### Purport

Although Urvaśī had adversely explained the nature of woman, Mahārāja Purūravā was very much attached to her, and therefore she wanted to give the King some concession by agreeing to be his wife for one night at the end of each year.

### Translation

**Urvaśī said: “My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be able to deliver me to you again.” In accordance with these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthālī girl who looked exactly like Urvaśī. Thinking that the girl was Urvaśī, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could understand that she was not Urvaśī but Agnisthālī.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that Purūravā was very lusty. Immediately after getting the Agnisthālī girl, he wanted to have sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the girl was Agnisthālī, not Urvaśī. This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman knows the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life. Thus Purūravā understood during sexual intercourse that the Agnisthālī girl was not Urvaśī.

### Synonyms

*sthālīm* — the woman Agnisthālī; *nyasya* — immediately giving up; *vane* — in the forest; *gatvā* — on returning; *gṛhān* — at home; *ādhyāyataḥ* — began to meditate; *niśi* — the whole night; *tretāyām* — when the Tretā millennium; *sampravṛttāyām* — was just on the point of beginning; *manasi* — in his mind; *trayī* — the principles of the three *Vedas*; *avartata* — became revealed.

### Translation

**King Purūravā then left Agnisthālī in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon Urvaśī. In the course of his meditation, the Tretā millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing yajña to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.**

### Purport

It is said, *tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ:* in Tretā-yuga, if one performed *yajñas,* he would get the results of those *yajñas.* By performing *viṣṇu-yajña* specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, *yajña* is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While Purūravā was meditating upon Urvaśī, the Tretā-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic *yajñas* were revealed in his heart. But Purūravā was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses. *Yajñas* for enjoyment of the senses are called *karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas.* Therefore, he decided to perform *karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas* to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, *karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas* are meant for sensuous persons, whereas *yajña* should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the *saṅkīrtana-yajña* is recommended. *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.* Only those who are very intelligent take to *saṅkīrtana-yajña* to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform *karma-kāṇḍīya-yajñas.*

### Translation

**When the process of fruitive yajña became manifest within his heart, King Purūravā went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthālī. There he saw that from the womb of a śamī tree, an aśvattha tree had grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two araṇis. Desiring to go to the planet where Urvaśī resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower araṇi as Urvaśī, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.**

### Purport

The Vedic fire for performing *yajña* was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the *araṇis,* or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of *yajña.* If successful, a *yajña* will fulfill the desire of its performer. Thus Purūravā took advantage of the process of *yajña* to fulfill his lusty desires. He thought of the lower *araṇi* as Urvaśī, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son. A relevant Vedic *mantra* quoted herein by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura is *śamī-garbhād agniṁ mantha.* A similar *mantra* is *urvaśyām urasi purūravāḥ.* Purūravā wanted to have children continuously by the womb of Urvaśī. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvaśī and thereby get a son. In other words, he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing *yajña* he thought of Urvaśī, instead of thinking of the master of *yajña,* Yajñeśvara, Lord Viṣṇu.

### Verse text

*tasya nirmanthanāj jāto  
jāta-vedā vibhāvasuḥ  
trayyā sa vidyayā rājñā  
putratve kalpitas tri-vṛt*

### Synonyms

*tasya* — of Purūravā; *nirmanthanāt* — because of interaction; *jātaḥ* — was born; *jāta*-*vedāḥ* — meant for material enjoyment according to the Vedic principles; *vibhāvasuḥ* — a fire; *trayyā* — following the Vedic principles; *saḥ* — the fire; *vidyayā* — by such a process; *rājñā* — by the King; *putratve* — a son’s being born; *kalpitaḥ* — it so became; *tri*-*vṛt* — the three letters *a-u-m* combined together as *om.*.

### Translation

**From Purūravā’s rubbing of the araṇis came a fire. By such a fire one can achieve all success in material enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are invoked with the combined letters a-u-m. Thus the fire was considered the son of King Purūravā.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (*śukra*), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (*sāvitra*), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (*yajña*). Thus when Mahārāja Purūravā generated the fire by rubbing the *araṇis,* the fire became his son. Either by semen, by initiation or by *yajña* one may get a son. The Vedic *mantra oṁkāra,* or *praṇava,* consisting of the letters *a-u-m,* can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the words *nirmanthanāj jātaḥ* indicate that by the rubbing of the *araṇis* a son was born.

### Verse text

*tenāyajata yajñeśaṁ  
bhagavantam adhokṣajam  
urvaśī-lokam anvicchan

### Synonyms

*tena* — by generating such a fire; *ayajata* — he worshiped; *yajña*-*īśam* — the master or enjoyer of the *yajña*; *bhagavantam* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *adhokṣajam* — beyond the perception of the senses; *urvaśī*-*lokam* — to the planet where Urvaśī was staying; *anvicchan* — although desiring to go; *sarva*-*deva*-*mayam* — the reservoir of all demigods; *harim* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**By means of that fire, Purūravā, who desired to go to the planet where Urvaśī resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of sacrifice. Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the demigods.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram:* any *loka,* or planet, to which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the performance of sacrifice. The purpose of *yajña* is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, as we have explained many times, the *yajña* of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is the only sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material or spiritual. *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.14) also says, *yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ:* by offering sacrifices to Lord Viṣṇu, one can have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything (*sarva-kāma-dughā mahī*). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, *sarva-kāma-dughā mahī* (*Bhāg.* 1.10.4). Everything is possible by performing *yajña.* Therefore although Purūravā desired something material, he factually performed *yajña* to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is *adhokṣaja,* beyond the perception of Purūravā and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of *yajña* must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity. *Yajñas* can be performed in human society only when society is divided by *varṇāśrama-dharma* into four *varṇas* and four *āśramas.* Without such a regulative process, no one can perform *yajñas,* and without the performance of *yajñas,* no material plans can make human society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform *yajñas.* In this Age of Kali, the *yajña* recommended is *saṅkīrtana,* the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.

एक एव पुरा वेद- प्रणव- सर्ववाङ्‌मय- ।

### Verse text

*eka eva purā vedaḥ  
praṇavaḥ sarva-vāṅmayaḥ  
devo nārāyaṇo nānya  
eko ’gnir varṇa eva ca*

### Synonyms

*ekaḥ* — only one; *eva* — indeed; *purā* — formerly; *vedaḥ* — book of transcendental knowledge; *praṇavaḥ* — *oṁkāra*; *sarva*-*vāk*-*mayaḥ* — consisting of all Vedic *mantras*; *devaḥ* — the Lord, God; *nārāyaṇaḥ* — only Nārāyaṇa (was worshipable in the Satya-yuga); *na* *anyaḥ* — no other; *ekaḥ* *agniḥ* — one division only for *agni*; *varṇaḥ* — order of life; *eva* *ca* — and certainly.

### Translation

**In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra — praṇava, the root of all Vedic mantras. In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommendation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human society was known as haṁsa.**

### Purport

In Satya-yuga there was only one *Veda,* not four. Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one *Veda,* the *Atharva Veda* (or, some say, the *Yajur Veda*), was divided into four — *Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg* and *Atharva* — for the facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only *mantra* was *oṁkāra* (*oṁ tat sat*). The same name *oṁkāra* is manifest in the *mantra* Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Unless one is a *brāhmaṇa,* one cannot utter *oṁkāra* and get the desired result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a *śūdra,* unfit for pronouncing the *praṇava, oṁkāra.* Therefore the *śāstras* have recommended the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* *Oṁkāra* is a *mantra,* or *mahā-mantra,* and Hare Kṛṣṇa is also a *mahā-mantra.* The purpose of pronouncing *oṁkāra* is to address the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva (*oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya*). And the purpose of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is the same. *Hare:* “O energy of the Lord!” *Kṛṣṇa:* “O Lord Kṛṣṇa!” *Hare:* “O energy of the Lord!” *Rāma:* “O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!” The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the *Vedas* (*vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ*). By worshiping the demigods, one worships the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree. But worshiping Nārāyaṇa, the all-inclusive Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on. In Satya-yuga people knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worshiping Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same purpose can be served in this Age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* as recommended in the *Bhāgavatam.* *Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.* Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

*purūravasaḥ* — from King Purūravā; *eva* — thus; *āsīt* — there was; *trayī* — the Vedic principles of *karma, jñāna* and *upāsanā*; *tretā*-*mukhe* — in the beginning of the Tretā-yuga; *nṛpa* — O King Parīkṣit; *agninā* — simply by generating the fire of sacrifice; *prajayā* — by his son; *rājā* — King Purūravā; *lokam* — to the planet; *gāndharvam* — of the Gandharvas; *eyivān* — achieved.

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, at the beginning of Tretā-yuga, King Purūravā inaugurated a karma-kāṇḍa sacrifice. Thus Purūravā, who considered the yajñic fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he desired.**

### Purport

In Satya-yuga, Lord Nārāyaṇa was worshiped by meditation (*kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇum*). Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, and achieved every success by this process of meditation. In the next *yuga,* Tretā-yuga, the performance of *yajña* began (*tretāyāṁ yajato mukhaiḥ*). Therefore this verse says, *trayī tretā-mukhe.* Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that in Tretā-yuga, beginning in the Svāyambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “King Purūravā Enchanted by Urvaśī.”*
