CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamīḍha and others.

The son of Bharadvāja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Bṛhatkṣatra, Jaya, Mahāvīrya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Saṅkṛti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a *brāhmaṇa* guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the *brāhmaṇa.* When the *brāhmaṇa* left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a *śūdra* appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the *śūdra* and himself. Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.

Garga, the son of Bharadvāja, had a son named Śini, and Śini’s son was Gārgya. Although Gārgya was a *kṣatriya* by birth, his sons became *brāhmaṇas.* The son of Mahāvīrya was Duritakṣaya, whose sons were Trayyāruṇi, Kavi and Puṣkarāruṇi. Although these three sons were born of a *kṣatriya* king, they also achieved the position of *brāhmaṇas.* The son of Bṛhatkṣatra constructed the city of Hastināpura and was known as Hastī. His sons were Ajamīḍha, Dvimīḍha and Purumīḍha.

From Ajamīḍha came Priyamedha and other *brāhmaṇas* and also a son named Bṛhadiṣu. The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Bṛhadiṣu were Bṛhaddhanu, Bṛhatkāya, Jayadratha, Viśada and Syenajit. From Syenajit came four sons — Rucirāśva, Dṛḍhahanu, Kāśya and Vatsa. From Rucirāśva came a son named Pāra, whose sons were Pṛthusena and Nīpa, and from Nīpa came one hundred sons. Another son of Nīpa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Viṣvaksena; from Viṣvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallāṭa.

The son of Dvimīḍha was Yavīnara, and from Yavīnara came many sons and grandsons, such as Kṛtimān, Satyadhṛti, Dṛḍhanemi, Supārśva, Sumati, Sannatimān, Kṛtī, Nīpa, Udgrāyudha, Kṣemya, Suvīra, Ripuñjaya and Bahuratha. Purumīḍha had no sons, but Ajamīḍha, in addition to his other sons, had a son named Nīla, whose son was Śānti. The descendants of Śānti were Suśānti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyāśva. Bharmyāśva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of *brāhmaṇas.* Mudgala had twins — a son, Divodāsa, and a daughter, Ahalyā. From Ahalyā, by her husband, Gautama, Śatānanda was born. The son of Śatānanda was Satyadhṛti, and his son was Śaradvān. Śaradvān’s son was known as Kṛpa, and Śaradvān’s daughter, known as Kṛpī, became the wife of Droṇācārya.

### Translation

**Rantideva never endeavored to earn anything. He would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of providence, but when guests came he would give them everything. Thus he underwent considerable suffering, along with the members of his family. Indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and water, yet Rantideva always remained sober. Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and his family were about to eat, a brāhmaṇa guest arrived.**

### Devanagari

तस्मै संव्यभजत् सोऽन्नमाद‍ृत्य श्रद्धयान्वित- ।  
हरिं सर्वत्र सम्पश्यन् स भुक्त्वा प्रययौ द्विज- ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*tasmai saṁvyabhajat so ’nnam  
ādṛtya śraddhayānvitaḥ  
hariṁ sarvatra saṁpaśyan  
sa bhuktvā prayayau dvijaḥ*

### Synonyms

*tasmai* — unto him (the *brāhmaṇa*); *saṁvyabhajat* — after dividing, gave his share; *saḥ* — he (Rantideva); *annam* — the food; *ādṛtya* — with great respect; *śraddhayā* *anvitaḥ* — and with faith; *harim* — the Supreme Lord; *sarvatra* — everywhere, or in the heart of every living being; *saṁpaśyan* — conceiving; *saḥ* — he; *bhuktvā* — after eating the food; *prayayau* — left that place; *dvijaḥ* — the *brāhmaṇa.*.

### Translation

**Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead everywhere, and in every living entity, he received the guest with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The brāhmaṇa guest ate his share and then went away.**

### Purport

Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord both in the *brāhmaṇa* and in the *caṇḍāla.* This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.18):

*vidyā-vinaya-sampanne  
brāhmaṇe gavi hastini  
śuni caiva śva-pāke ca  
paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle *brāhmaṇa,* a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater \[outcaste\].” A *paṇḍita,* or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called *daridra-nārāyaṇa,* or “poor Nārāyaṇa,” Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Nārāyaṇa is present in the heart of one who is *daridra,* or poor, the poor man should be called *daridra-nārāyaṇa* is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Nārāyaṇa. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ*). It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Māyāvāda philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.

### Devanagari

अथान्यो भोक्ष्यमाणस्य विभक्तस्य महीपते- ।  
विभक्तं व्यभजत् तस्मै वृषलाय हरिं स्मरन् ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*athānyo bhokṣyamāṇasya  
vibhaktasya mahīpateḥ  
vibhaktaṁ vyabhajat tasmai  
vṛṣalāya hariṁ smaran*

### Synonyms

*atha* — thereafter; *anyaḥ* — another guest; *bhokṣyamāṇasya* — who was just about to eat; *vibhaktasya* — after setting aside the share for the family; *mahīpateḥ* — of the King; *vibhaktam* — the food allotted for the family; *vyabhajat* — he divided and distributed; *tasmai* — unto him; *vṛṣalāya* — unto a *śūdra*; *harim* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *smaran* — remembering.

### Translation

**Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a śūdra guest arrived. Seeing the śūdra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.**

### Purport

Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he never distinguished between the *brāhmaṇa* and the *śūdra,* the poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called *sama-darśinaḥ* (*paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*). One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the *brāhmaṇa* and the *śūdra,* the poor (*daridra*) and the rich (*dhanī*). Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.

### Translation

**Aggrieved at hearing the pitiable words of the poor fatigued caṇḍāla, Mahārāja Rantideva spoke the following nectarean words.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Rantideva’s words were like *amṛta,* or nectar, and therefore, aside from rendering bodily service to an aggrieved person, by his words alone the King could save the life of anyone who might hear him.

*na kāmaye ’haṁ gatim īśvarāt parām  
aṣṭarddhi-yuktām apunar-bhavaṁ vā  
ārtiṁ prapadye ’khila-deha-bhājām  
antaḥ-sthito yena bhavanty aduḥkhāḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *kāmaye* — desire; *aham* — I; *gatim* — destination; *īśvarāt* — from the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *parām* — great; *aṣṭa*-*ṛddhi*-*yuktām* — composed of the eight kinds of mystic perfection; *apunaḥ*-*bhavam* — cessation of repeated birth (liberation, salvation); *vā* — either; *ārtim* — sufferings; *prapadye* — I accept; *akhila*-*deha*-*bhājām* — of all living entities; *antaḥ*-*sthitaḥ* — staying among them; *yena* — by which; *bhavanti* — they become; *aduḥkhāḥ* — without distress.

### Translation

**I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the eight perfections of mystic yoga, nor for salvation from repeated birth and death. I want only to stay among all the living entities and suffer all distresses on their behalf, so that they may be freed from suffering.**

### Purport

Vāsudeva Datta made a similar statement to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, requesting the Lord to liberate all living entities in His presence. Vāsudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaiṣṇava is therefore described as being *para-duḥkha-duḥkhī,* very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiṣṇava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society.

*sa vai tebhyo namaskṛtya  
niḥsaṅgo vigata-spṛhaḥ

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — he (King Rantideva); *vai* — indeed; *tebhyaḥ* — unto Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the other demigods; *namaḥ*-*kṛtya* — offering obeisances; *niḥsaṅgaḥ* — with no ambition to take any benefit from them; *vigata*-*spṛhaḥ* — completely free from desires for material possessions; *vāsudeve* — unto Lord Vāsudeva; *bhagavati* — the Supreme Lord; *bhaktyā* — by devotional service; *cakre* — fixed; *manaḥ* — the mind; *param* — as the ultimate goal of life.

### Translation

**King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from the demigods. He offered them obeisances, but because he was factually attached to Lord Viṣṇu, Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he fixed his mind at Lord Viṣṇu’s lotus feet.**

### Purport

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:

*anya devāśraya nāi, tomāre kahinu bhāi,  
ei bhakti parama karaṇa*

If one wants to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, one should not hanker to take benedictions from the demigods. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20), *kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ:* those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, he did not hanker to take material benefits from them. Rather, he fixed his mind upon Lord Vāsudeva and rendered devotional service unto Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is not adulterated by material desires.

*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ  
jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam  
ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-  
śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*

“One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.”

### Synonyms

*īśvara*-*ālambanam* — completely taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord; *cittam* — his consciousness; *kurvataḥ* — fixing; *ananya*-*rādhasaḥ* — for Rantideva, who was undeviating and desired nothing other than to serve the Supreme Lord; *māyā* — the illusory energy; *guṇa*-*mayī* — consisting of the three modes of nature; *rājan* — O Mahārāja Parīkṣit; *svapna*-*vat* — like a dream; *pratyalīyata* — merged.

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, because King Rantideva was a pure devotee, always Kṛṣṇa conscious and free from all material desires, the Lord’s illusory energy, māyā, could not exhibit herself before him. On the contrary, for him māyā entirely vanished, exactly like a dream.**

### Purport

As it is said:

*kṛṣṇa — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra  
yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa, tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra*

Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure Kṛṣṇa conscious person there can be no existence of *māyā.* The Lord Himself says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14):

*daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī  
mama māyā duratyayā  
mām eva ye prapadyante  
māyām etāṁ taranti te*

“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.” If one wants to be free from the influence of *māyā,* the illusory energy, one must become Kṛṣṇa conscious and always keep Kṛṣṇa prominent within the core of his heart. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (*man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru*). In this way, by always being Kṛṣṇa-minded or Kṛṣṇa conscious, one can surpass the influence of *māyā* (*māyām etāṁ taranti te*). Because Rantideva was Kṛṣṇa conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word *svapnavat* is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one’s dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Kṛṣṇa conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.

तत्प्रसङ्गानुभावेन रन्तिदेवानुवर्तिन- ।  
अभवन् योगिन- सर्वे नारायणपरायणा- ॥ १८ ॥

### Verse text

*tat-prasaṅgānubhāvena  
rantidevānuvartinaḥ  
abhavan yoginaḥ sarve  
nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇāḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat*-*prasaṅga*-*anubhāvena* — because of associating with King Rantideva (when talking with him about *bhakti-yoga*); *rantideva*-*anuvartinaḥ* — the followers of King Rantideva (that is, his servants, his family members, his friends and others); *abhavan* — became; *yoginaḥ* — first-class mystic *yogīs,* or *bhakti-yogīs*; *sarve* — all of them; *nārāyaṇa*-*parāyaṇāḥ* — devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa.

### Translation

**All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were totally favored by his mercy and became pure devotees, attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa. Thus they all became the best of yogīs.**

### Purport

The best *yogīs* or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.47):

*yoginām api sarveṣāṁ  
mad-gatenāntarātmanā  
śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ  
sa me yuktatamo mataḥ*

“Of all *yogīs,* he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in *yoga* and is the highest of all.” The best *yogī* is he who constantly thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, by the king’s transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said that a Vaiṣṇava is meritorious in proportion to the number of devotees he has created. A Vaiṣṇava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word *rantidevānuvartinaḥ* indicates that Rantideva’s officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaiṣṇavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or *mahā-bhāgavata.* *Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ:* one should render service to such *mahātmās,* for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has also said, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:* one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaiṣṇava, the door to liberation is open.

### Translation

**From Garga came a son named Śini, and his son was Gārgya. Although Gārgya was a kṣatriya, there came from him a generation of brahmaṇas. From Mahāvīrya came a son named Duritakṣaya, whose sons were Trayyāruṇi, Kavi and Puṣkarāruṇi. Although these sons of Duritakṣaya took birth in a dynasty of kṣatriyas, they too attained the position of brāhmaṇas. Bṛhatkṣatra had a son named Hastī, who established the city of Hastināpura \[now New Delhi\].**

*ajamīḍhaḥ* — Ajamīḍha; *dvimīḍhaḥ* — Dvimīḍha; *ca* — also; *purumīḍhaḥ* — Purumīḍha; *ca* — also; *hastinaḥ* — became the sons of Hastī; *ajamīḍhasya* — of Ajamīḍha; *vaṁśyāḥ* — descendants; *syuḥ* — are; *priyamedha*-*ādayaḥ* — headed by Priyamedha; *dvijāḥ* — *brāhmaṇas.*.

### Translation

**From King Hastī came three sons, named Ajamīḍha, Dvimīḍha and Purumīḍha. The descendants of Ajamīḍha, headed by Priyamedha, all achieved the position of brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of *Bhagavad-gītā* that the orders of society — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* — are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (*guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ*). All the descendants of Ajamīḍha, who was a *kṣatriya,* became *brāhmaṇas.* This was certainly because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons of *brāhmaṇas* or *kṣatriyas* become *vaiśyas* (*brāhmaṇa-vaiśyatāṁ gatāḥ*). When a *kṣatriya* or *brāhmaṇa* adopts the occupation or duty of a *vaiśya* (*kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyam*), he is certainly counted as a *vaiśya.* On the other hand, if one is born a *vaiśya,* by his activities he can become a *brāhmaṇa.* This is confirmed by Nārada Muni. *Yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.* The members of the *varṇas,* or social orders — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* — must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.

### Purport

The Śuka mentioned here is different from the Śukadeva Gosvāmī who spoke *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, is described in great detail in the *Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa.* There it is said that Vyāsadeva maintained the daughter of Jābāli as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of *māyā.* Vyāsadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by *māyā,* but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children. Vyāsadeva then went to Dvārakā and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyāsadeva’s request, went to Vyāsadeva’s cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by *māyā.* Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a *parivrājakācārya.* When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the boy created a duplicate Śukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the *śuka-kanyā,* or daughter of Śukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Śukadeva. The original Śukadeva was a lifelong *brahmacārī.*
