CHAPTER SEVEN

In this chapter the descendants of King Māndhātā are described, and in this connection the histories of Purukutsa and Hariścandra are also given.

The most prominent son of Māndhātā was Ambarīṣa, his son was Yauvanāśva, and Yauvanāśva’s son was Hārīta. These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Māndhātā. Purukutsa, another son of Māndhātā, married the sister of the snakes (*sarpa-gaṇa*) named Narmadā. The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaraṇya. Anaraṇya’s son was Haryaśva, Haryaśva’s son was Prāruṇa, Prāruṇa’s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana’s son was Satyavrata, also known as Triśaṅku. When Triśaṅku kidnapped the daughter of a *brāhmaṇa,* his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Triśaṅku became a *caṇḍāla,* worse than a *śūdra.* Later, by the influence of Viśvāmitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of Viśvāmitra. The son of Triśaṅku was Hariścandra. Hariścandra once performed a Rājasūya-yajña, but Viśvāmitra cunningly took all of Hariścandra’s possessions as a *dakṣiṇa* contribution and chastised Hariścandra in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha. Hariścandra had no sons, but on the advice of Nārada he worshiped Varuṇa and in this way got a son named Rohita. Hariścandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuṇa-yajña. Varuṇa reminded Hariścandra repeatedly about this *yajña,* but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest. Meanwhile, at home, Hariścandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuṇa. When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so. Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then returned home. Rohita purchased Śunaḥśepha, the second son of Ajīgarta, and gave him to his father, Hariścandra, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuṇa and the other demigods were pacified, and Hariścandra was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, Viśvāmitra was the *hotā* priest, Jamadagni was the *adhvaryu,* Vasiṣṭha was the *brahmā,* and Ayāsya was the *udgātā.* King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariścandra a golden chariot, and Viśvāmitra gave him transcendental knowledge. Thus Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes how Hariścandra achieved perfection.

त्रैशङ्कवो हरिश्चन्द्रो विश्वामित्रवसिष्ठयो- ।  
यन्निमित्तमभूद् युद्धं पक्षिणोर्बहुवार्षिकम् ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*traiśaṅkavo hariścandro  
viśvāmitra-vasiṣṭhayoḥ  
yan-nimittam abhūd yuddhaṁ  
pakṣiṇor bahu-vārṣikam*

### Synonyms

*traiśaṅkavaḥ* — the son of Triśaṅku; *hariścandraḥ* — by the name Hariścandra; *viśvāmitra*-*vasiṣṭhayoḥ* — between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha; *yat*-*nimittam* — because of Hariścandra; *abhūt* — there was; *yuddham* — a great fight; *pakṣiṇoḥ* — both of whom had been converted into birds; *bahu*-*vārṣikam* — for many years.

### Translation

**The son of Triśaṅku was Hariścandra. Because of Hariścandra there was a quarrel between Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha, who for many years fought one another, having been transformed into birds.**

### Purport

Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha were always inimical. Formerly, Viśvāmitra was a *kṣatriya,* and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to become a *brāhmaṇa,* but Vasiṣṭha would not agree to accept him. In this way there was always disagreement between the two. Later, however, Vasiṣṭha accepted him because of Viśvāmitra’s quality of forgiveness. Once Hariścandra performed a *yajña* for which Viśvāmitra was the priest, but Viśvāmitra, being angry at Hariścandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a contribution of *dakṣiṇā.* Vasiṣṭha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra. The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed the other. One of them said, “May you become a bird,” and the other said, “May you become a duck.” Thus both of them became birds and continued fighting for many years because of Hariścandra. We can see that such a great mystic *yogī* as Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and such great sages as Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra became birds. This is the material world. *Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino ’rjuna.* Within this material world, or within this universe, however elevated one may be in material qualities, one must suffer the conditions of birth, death, old age and disease (*janma-mṛtyu jarā-vyādhi*). Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that this material world is simply miserable (*duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam*). The *Bhāgavatam* says, *padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām:* at every step here there is danger. Therefore, because the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* this movement is the greatest benediction in human society.

### Purport

It appears that in those days a man could be purchased for any purpose. Hariścandra was in need of a person to sacrifice as the animal in a *yajña* and thus fulfill his promise to Varuṇa, and a man was purchased from another man for this purpose. Millions of years ago, animal sacrifice and slave trade both existed. Indeed, they have existed since time immemorial.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Hariścandra first purified his mind, which was full of material enjoyment, by amalgamating it with the earth.

Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total material energy with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization of one’s self as part of the Supreme Lord. When the self-realized spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally imperceptible and inconceivable. Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from material bondage.**
