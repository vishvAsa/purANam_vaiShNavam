CHAPTER TWO

This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karūṣa.

After Sudyumna accepted the order of *vānaprastha* and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, Pṛṣadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Pṛṣadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger. Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a *śūdra* family, but Pṛṣadhra practiced mystic *yoga,* and in *bhakti-yoga* he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.

Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood. From Manu’s son known as Karūṣa, a sect of *kṣatriyas* known as Kārūṣas was generated. Manu also had a son known as Dhṛṣṭa, from whom another sect of *kṣatriyas* was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a *kṣatriya,* they became *brāhmaṇas.* From Nṛga, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhūtajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in succession, came Pratīka, and from him came Oghavān. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Nariṣyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Ṛkṣa, Mīḍhvān, Pūrṇa, Indrasena, Vītihotra, Satyaśravā, Uruśravā, Devadatta and Agniveśya. From the *kṣatriya* known as Agniveśya came the celebrated *brāhmaṇa* dynasty known as Āgniveśyāyana. From the seminal dynasty of Diṣṭa, another son of Manu, came Nābhāga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsaprīti, Prāṁśu, Pramati, Khanitra, Cākṣuṣa, Viviṁśati, Rambha, Khanīnetra, Karandhama, Avīkṣit, Marutta, Dama, Rājyavardhana, Sudhṛti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhumān, Vegavān, Budha and Tṛṇabindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty. From Tṛṇabindu came a daughter named Ilavilā, from whom Kuvera took birth. Tṛṇabindu also had three sons, named Viśāla, Śūnyabandhu and Dhūmraketu. The son of Viśāla was Hemacandra, his son was Dhūmrākṣa, and his son was Saṁyama. The sons of Saṁyama were Devaja and Kṛśāśva. Kṛśāśva’s son, Somadatta, performed an Aśvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *evam* — thus; *gate* — had accepted the order of *vānaprastha*; *atha* — thereafter; *sudyumne* — when Sudyumna; *manuḥ* *vaivasvataḥ* — Vaivasvata Manu, known as Śrāddhadeva; *sute* — his son; *putra*-*kāmaḥ* — desiring to get sons; *tapaḥ* *tepe* — executed severe austerities; *yamunāyām* — on the bank of the Yamunā; *śatam* *samāḥ* — for one hundred years.

### Verse text

*tato ’yajan manur devam

### Translation

**Then, because of this desire for sons, the Manu known as Śrāddhadeva worshiped the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the demigods. Thus he got ten sons exactly like himself. Among them all, Ikṣvāku was the eldest.**

पृषध्रस्तु मनो- पुत्रो गोपालो गुरुणा कृत- ।  
पालयामास गा यत्तो रात्र्यां वीरासनव्रत- ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*pṛṣadhras tu manoḥ putro  
go-pālo guruṇā kṛtaḥ  
pālayām āsa gā yatto  
rātryāṁ vīrāsana-vrataḥ*

### Synonyms

*pṛṣadhraḥ* *tu* — among them, Pṛṣadhra; *manoḥ* — of Manu; *putraḥ* — the son; *go*-*pālaḥ* — herding cows; *guruṇā* — by the order of his spiritual master; *kṛtaḥ* — having been engaged; *pālayām* *āsa* — he protected; *gāḥ* — cows; *yattaḥ* — so engaged; *rātryām* — at night; *vīrāsana*-*vrataḥ* — taking the vow of *vīrāsana,* standing with a sword.

### Translation

**Among these sons, Pṛṣadhra, following the order of his spiritual master, was engaged as a protector of cows. He would stand all night with a sword to give the cows protection.**

### Purport

One who becomes *vīrāsana* takes the vow to stand all night with a sword to give protection to the cows. Because Pṛṣadhra was engaged in this way, it is to be understood that he had no dynasty. We can further understand from this vow accepted by Pṛṣadhra how essential it is to protect the cows. Some son of a *kṣatriya* would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even at night. What then is to be said of sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is the most sinful activity in human society.

He took up his sword, but because the stars were covered by clouds, he mistook the cow for the tiger and mistakenly cut off the cows’ head with great force.**

### Devanagari

तं शशाप कुलाचार्य- कृतागसमकामत- ।  
न क्षत्रबन्धु- शूद्रस्त्वं कर्मणा भवितामुना ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*taṁ śaśāpa kulācāryaḥ  
kṛtāgasam akāmataḥ  
na kṣatra-bandhuḥ śūdras tvaṁ  
karmaṇā bhavitāmunā*

### Synonyms

*tam* — him (Pṛṣadhra); *śaśāpa* — cursed; *kula*-*ācāryaḥ* — the family priest, Vasiṣṭha; *kṛta*-*āgasam* — because of committing the great sin of killing a cow; *akāmataḥ* — although he did not want to do it; *na* — not; *kṣatra*-*bandhuḥ* — the family member of a *kṣatriya*; *śūdraḥ* *tvam* — you have behaved like a *śūdra*; *karmaṇā* — therefore by your fruitive reaction; *bhavitā* — you shall become a *śūdra*; *amunā* — because of killing the cow.

### Translation

**Although Pṛṣadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his family priest, Vasiṣṭha, cursed him, saying, “In your next life you shall not be able to become a kṣatriya. Instead, you shall take birth as a śūdra because of killing the cow.”**

### Purport

It appears that Vasiṣṭha was not free from *tamo-guṇa,* the mode of ignorance. As the family priest or spiritual master of Pṛṣadhra, Vasiṣṭha should have taken Pṛṣadhra’s offense very lightly, but instead Vasiṣṭha cursed him to become a *śūdra.* It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement. Vasiṣṭha, however, did just the opposite. Therefore Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that he was *durmati;* in other words, his intelligence was not very good.

**Thereafter, Pṛṣadhra gained relief from all responsibilities, became peaceful in mind, and established control over all his senses. Being unaffected by material conditions, being pleased with whatever was available by the grace of the Lord to maintain body and soul together, and being equal toward everyone, he gave full attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, who is the transcendental Supersoul, free from material contamination. Thus Pṛṣadhra, fully satisfied in pure knowledge, always keeping his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, achieved pure devotional service to the Lord and began traveling all over the world, without affection for material activities, as if he were deaf, dumb and blind.**

### Devanagari

एवं वृत्तो वनं गत्वा दृष्ट्वा दावाग्निमुत्थितम् ।

### Verse text

*evaṁ vṛtto vanaṁ gatvā  
dṛṣṭvā dāvāgnim utthitam  
tenopayukta-karaṇo  
brahma prāpa paraṁ muniḥ*

### Synonyms

*evam* *vṛttaḥ* — being situated in such an order of life; *vanam* — to the forest; *gatvā* — after going; *dṛṣṭvā* — when he saw; *dāva*-*agnim* — a forest fire; *utthitam* — existing there; *tena* — by that (fire); *upayukta*-*karaṇaḥ* — engaging all the senses of the body by burning; *brahma* — transcendence; *prāpa* — he achieved; *param* — the ultimate goal; *muniḥ* — as a great saintly person.

### Translation

**With this attitude, Pṛṣadhra became a great saint, and when he entered the forest and saw a blazing forest fire, he took this opportunity to burn his body in the fire. Thus he achieved the transcendental, spiritual world.**

### Purport

The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam  
evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma  
naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” Pṛṣadhra, because of his *karma,* was cursed to take his next birth as a *śūdra,* but because he took to saintly life, specifically concentrating his mind always upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a pure devotee. Immediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*mām eti*), as a result of his devotional situation. Devotional service performed by thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although Pṛṣadhra was cursed he avoided the terrible consequence of becoming a *śūdra* and instead returned home, back to Godhead. As stated in *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.54):

*yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma-  
bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam ātanoti  
karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of their material activities. Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe up to the King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of *karma.* A pure devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from these laws.

### Synonyms

*dhṛṣṭāt* — from Dhṛṣṭa, another son of Manu; *dhārṣṭam* — a caste of the name Dhārṣṭa; *abhūt* — was produced; *kṣatram* — belonging to the *kṣatriya* group; *brahma*-*bhūyam* — the position of *brāhmaṇas*; *gatam* — had achieved; *kṣitau* — on the surface of the world; *nṛgasya* — of Nṛga, another son of Manu; *vaṁśaḥ* — the dynasty; *sumatiḥ* — of the name Sumati; *bhūtajyotiḥ* — of the name Bhūtajyoti; *tataḥ* — thereafter; *vasuḥ* — by the name Vasu.

### Translation

**From the son of Manu named Dhṛṣṭa came a kṣatriya caste called Dhārṣṭa, whose members achieved the position of brāhmaṇas in this world. Then, from the son of Manu named Nṛga came Sumati. From Sumati came Bhūtajyoti, and from Bhūtajyoti came Vasu.**

### Purport

Here it is said, *kṣatraṁ brahma-bhūyaṁ gataṁ kṣitau:* although the Dhārṣṭas belonged to the *kṣatriya* caste, they were able to convert themselves into *brāhmaṇas.* This gives clear evidence supporting the following statement by Nārada (*Bhāg.* 7.11.35):

*yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ  
puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam  
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta  
tat tenaiva vinirdiśet*

If the qualities of one group are found in the men of another, those men should be recognized by their qualities, by their symptoms, not by the caste of the family in which they were born. Birth is not at all important; it is one’s qualities that are stressed in all Vedic literature.

### Purport

From Manu, one son became a *kṣatriya,* another a *brāhmaṇa,* and another a *vaiśya.* This confirms the statement by Nārada Muni, *yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam* (*Bhāg.* 7.11.35). One should always remember that *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* should never be regarded as members of a caste by birth. A *brāhmaṇa* may be changed into a *kṣatriya,* and a *kṣatriya* into a *brāhmaṇa.* Similarly, a *brāhmaṇa* or *kṣatriya* may be changed into a *vaiśya,* and a *vaiśya* into a *brāhmaṇa* or *kṣatriya.* This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ*). So one is a *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* never by birth, but by quality. There is a great need of *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore, in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are trying to train some *brāhmaṇas* to guide human society. Because at present there is a scarcity of *brāhmaṇas,* the brain of human society is lost. Because practically everyone is a *śūdra,* no one at the present moment can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to achieve perfection in life.
