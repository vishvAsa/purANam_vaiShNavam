CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR

Vidarbha had three sons, named Kuśa, Kratha and Romapāda. Of these three, Romapāda expanded his dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Kṛti, Uśika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became kings. From the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from whose dynasty came the descendants named Vṛṣṇi, Nirvṛti, Daśārha, Vyoma, Jīmūta, Vikṛti, Bhīmaratha, Navaratha, Daśaratha, Śakuni, Karambhi, Devarāta, Devakṣatra, Madhu, Kuruvaśa, Anu, Puruhotra, Ayu and Sātvata. Sātvata had seven sons. One of them was Devāvṛdha, whose son was Babhru. Another son of Sātvata was Mahābhoja, by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated. Another was Vṛṣṇi, who had a son named Yudhājit. From Yudhājit came Anamitra and Śini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Śini. The descendants in succession from Śini were Satyaka, Yuyudhāna, Jaya, Kuṇi and Yugandhara. Another son of Anamitra was Vṛṣṇi. From Vṛṣṇi came Śvaphalka, by whom Akrūra and twelve other sons were generated. From Akrūra came two sons, named Devavān and Upadeva. The son of Andhaka named Kukura was the origin of the descendants known as Vahni, Vilomā, Kapotaromā, Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Avidyota, Punarvasu and Āhuka. Āhuka had two sons, named Devaka and Ugrasena. The four sons of Devaka were known as Devavān, Upadeva, Sudeva and Devavardhana, and his seven daughters were Dhṛtadevā, Śāntidevā, Upadevā, Śrīdevā, Devarakṣitā, Sahadevā and Devakī. Vasudeva married all seven daughters of Devaka. Ugrasena had nine sons named Kaṁsa, Sunāmā, Nyagrodha, Kaṅka, Śaṅku, Suhū, Rāṣṭrapāla, Dhṛṣṭi and Tuṣṭimān, and he had five daughters named Kaṁsā, Kaṁsavatī, Kaṅkā, Śūrabhū and Rāṣṭrapālikā. The younger brothers of Vasudeva married all the daughters of Ugrasena.

Vidūratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Śūra, who had ten other sons, of whom Vasudeva was the chief. Śūra gave one of his five daughters, Pṛthā, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named Kuntī. In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karṇa, and later she married Mahārāja Pāṇḍu.

Vṛddhaśarmā married the daughter of Śūra named Śrutadevā, from whose womb Dantavakra was born. Dhṛṣṭaketu married Śūra’s daughter named Śrutakīrti, who had five sons. Jayasena married Śūra’s daughter named Rājādhidevī. The king of Cedi-deśa, Damaghoṣa, married the daughter of Śūra named Śrutaśravā, from whom Śiśupāla was born.

Devabhāga, through the womb of Kaṁsā, begot Citraketu and Bṛhadbala; and Devaśravā, through the womb of Kaṁsavatī, begot Suvīra and Iṣumān. From Kaṅka, through the womb of Kaṅkā, came Baka, Satyajit and Purujit, and from Sṛñjaya, through the womb of Rāṣṭrapālikā, came Vṛṣa and Durmarṣaṇa. Śyāmaka, through the womb of Śūrabhūmi, begot Harikeśa and Hiraṇyākṣa. Vatsaka, through the womb of Miśrakeśī, begot Vṛka, who begot the sons named Takṣa, Puṣkara and Śāla. From Samīka came Sumitra and Arjunapāla, and from Ānaka came Ṛtadhāmā and Jaya.

Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devakī and Rohiṇī were the most important. From the womb of Rohiṇī, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, Sāraṇa, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Kṛta and others. Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devakī was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons. This chapter ends by glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vāsudeva.

When Vasudeva was born, the demigods from the heavenly kingdom sounded kettledrums. Therefore Vasudeva, who provided the proper place for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, was also known as Ānakadundubhi. The five daughters of King Śūra, named Pṛthā, Śrutadevā, Śrutakīrti, Śrutaśravā and Rājādhidevī, were Vasudeva’s sisters. Śūra gave Pṛthā to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore another name of Pṛthā was Kuntī.**

### Purport

According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before she is married, no one will marry her. Therefore although the sun-god, after appearing before Pṛthā, wanted to give her a child, Pṛthā hesitated because she was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the sun-god arranged to give her a child that came from her ear, and therefore the child was known as Karṇa. The custom is that a girl should be married *akṣata-yoni,* that is, with her virginity undisturbed. A girl should never bear a child before her marriage.

### Translation

**The eight sons born of Sahadevā such as Pravara and Śruta, were exact incarnations of the eight Vasus in the heavenly planets. Vasudeva also begot eight highly qualified sons through the womb of Devakī. These included Kīrtimān, Suṣeṇa, Bhadrasena, Ṛju, Sammardana, Bhadra and Saṅkarṣaṇa, the controller and serpent incarnation. The eighth son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself — Kṛṣṇa. The highly fortunate Subhadrā, the one daughter, was your grandmother.**

### Purport

The fifty-fifth verse says, *svayam eva hariḥ kila,* indicating that Kṛṣṇa, the eighth son of Devakī, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa is not an incarnation. Although there is no difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari and His incarnation, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, the complete Godhead. Incarnations exhibit only a certain percentage of the potencies of Godhead; the complete Godhead is Kṛṣṇa Himself, who appeared as the eighth son of Devakī.

### Verse text

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
kṣayo vṛddhiś ca pāpmanaḥ  
tadā tu bhagavān īśa  
ātmānaṁ sṛjate hariḥ*

### Synonyms

*yadā* — whenever; *yadā* — whenever; *hi* — indeed; *dharmasya* — of the principles of religion; *kṣayaḥ* — deterioration; *vṛddhiḥ* — increasing; *ca* — and; *pāpmanaḥ* — of sinful activities; *tadā* — at that time; *tu* — indeed; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *īśaḥ* — the supreme controller; *ātmānam* — personally; *sṛjate* — descends; *hariḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Whenever the principles of religion deteriorate and the principles of irreligion increase, the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead Śrī Hari, appears by His own will.**

### Purport

The principles by which an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends upon earth are explained in this verse. The same principles are also explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7) by the Lord Himself:

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.”

In the present age, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to inaugurate the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. At the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad (*manda*). They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form to live like cats and dogs. Under these circumstances Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, which is not different from Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one associates with this movement, he directly associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People should take advantage of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* and thus gain relief from all the problems created in this Age of Kali.

### Verse text

*na hy asya janmano hetuḥ  
karmaṇo vā mahīpate  
ātma-māyāṁ vineśasya  
parasya draṣṭur ātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *hi* — indeed; *asya* — of Him (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); *janmanaḥ* — of the appearance, or taking birth; *hetuḥ* — there is any cause; *karmaṇaḥ* — or for acting; *vā* — either; *mahīpate* — O King (Mahārāja Parīkṣit); *ātma*-*māyām* — His supreme compassion for the fallen souls; *vinā* — without; *īśasya* — of the supreme controller; *parasya* — of the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the material world; *draṣṭuḥ* — of the Supersoul, who witnesses everyone’s activities; *ātmanaḥ* — of the Supersoul of everyone.

### Translation

**O King, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, but for the Lord’s personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul, He knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.**

### Purport

This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being. An ordinary living being receives a particular type of body according to his past activities (*karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye*). A living being is never independent and can never appear independently. Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed upon him by *māyā* according to his past *karma.* As explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61), *yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.* The body is a kind of machine created and offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body awarded to him by *māyā,* the material energy, according to his *karma.* One cannot independently say, “Give me a body like this” or “Give me a body like that.” One must accept whatever body is offered by the material energy. This is the position of the ordinary living being.

When Kṛṣṇa descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion for the fallen souls. As the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.8):

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ  
vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya  
sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

“To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.” The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear. Indeed, no one can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under His control, and He is not under the control of anyone else. Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge think that one can equal Kṛṣṇa or become Kṛṣṇa are condemned in every way. No one can equal or surpass Kṛṣṇa, who is therefore described as *asamordhva.* According to the *Viśva-kośa* dictionary, the word *māyā* is used in the sense of “false pride” and also in the sense of “compassion.” For an ordinary living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment. As the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.14), *daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā:* “This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.” But when Kṛṣṇa comes the word *māyā* refers to His compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls. By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone, whether sinful or pious.

यन्मायाचेष्टितं पुंस- स्थित्युत्पत्त्यप्ययाय हि । अनुग्रहस्तन्निवृत्तेरात्मलाभाय चेष्यते ॥ ५८ ॥

### Verse text

*yan māyā-ceṣṭitaṁ puṁsaḥ

anugrahas tan-nivṛtter  
ātma-lābhāya ceṣyate*

### Synonyms

*yat* — whatever; *māyā*-*ceṣṭitam* — the laws of material nature enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *puṁsaḥ* — of the living entities; *sthiti* — duration of life; *utpatti* — birth; *apyayāya* — annihilation; *hi* — indeed; *anugrahaḥ* — compassion; *tat*-*nivṛtteḥ* — the creation and manifestation of cosmic energy to stop the repetition of birth and death; *ātma*-*lābhāya* — thus going home, back to Godhead; *ca* — indeed; *iṣyate* — for this purpose the creation is there.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material energy in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation just to deliver the living entity by His compassion and stop the living entity’s birth, death and duration of materialistic life. Thus He enables the living being to return home, back to Godhead.**

### Purport

Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world for the suffering of the living entities. The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke  
jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi  
prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

“The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.” All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency. *Ānandamayo ’bhyāsāt* (*Vedānta-sūtra* 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Kṛṣṇa, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahmā and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool. This is called *manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati.* There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature’s full control (*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ*). Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world. *Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*. He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (*ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate*). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues. *Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 10.2.32). Even having attained that *paraṁ padam,* having merged into the impersonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world.

In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears in this world and instructs him. Thus the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.” The real *dharma* is to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, but the rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, engages in *adharma,* in a struggle for existence to become like Kṛṣṇa. Therefore out of compassion Kṛṣṇa creates this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real position. *Bhagavad-gītā* and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. *Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ* (Bg. 15.15). All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called *brahma-jijñāsā.* Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says, *anugrahas tan-nivṛtteḥ,* indicating that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated. This is the purpose of the creation.

The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think.

*asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te  
jagad āhur anīśvaram  
aparaspara-sambhūtaṁ  
kim anyat kāma-haitukam*

“They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust.” (Bg. 16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child. Actually, however, this is not the fact. The fact is that there is a purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in the spiritual world. In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place for happiness. *Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam* (Bg. 13.9). One must stop the repetition of birth and death. Every human being, therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding Kṛṣṇa and his relationship with Kṛṣṇa and in this way return home, back to Godhead.

अक्षौहिणीनां पतिभिरसुरैर्नृपलाञ्छनै- । भुव आक्रम्यमाणाया अभाराय कृतोद्यम- ॥ ५९ ॥

### Verse text

*akṣauhiṇīnāṁ patibhir  
asurair nṛpa-lāñchanaiḥ  
bhuva ākramyamāṇāyā  
abhārāya kṛtodyamaḥ*

### Synonyms

*akṣauhiṇīnām* — of kings possessing great military power; *patibhiḥ* — by such kings or government; *asuraiḥ* — actually demons (because they do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily); *nṛpa*-*lāñchanaiḥ* — who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have somehow taken possession of the government); *bhuvaḥ* — on the surface of the earth; *ākramyamāṇāyāḥ* — aiming at attacking one another; *abhārāya* — paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on the surface of the earth; *kṛta*-*udyamaḥ* — enthusiastic (they spend all the revenue of the state to increase military power).

### Translation

**Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.8), *paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.* The *sādhus,* the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the conditioned souls may be released from the bondage of birth and death. But the *asuras,* the demons, impede the advancement of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and therefore Kṛṣṇa arranges occasional fights between different *asuras* who are very much interested in increasing their military power. The duty of the government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to see that the people of the state advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For this purpose, Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13), *cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:* “According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.” There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide *brāhmaṇas,* and they should be given all protection. *Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.* Kṛṣṇa is very fond of *brāhmaṇas* and cows. The *brāhmaṇas* promulgate the cause of advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness. The *kṣatriyas* and the government should be advised by the *brāhmaṇas.* Next, the *vaiśyas* should produce enough foodstuffs, and the *śūdras,* who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas*). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of Kṛṣṇa’s descent on the surface of the earth (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām*).

Everyone must understand Kṛṣṇa’s activities (*janma karma ca me divyam*). If one understands the purpose of Kṛṣṇa’s coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This liberation is the purpose of the creation and Kṛṣṇa’s descent upon the surface of the earth. Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Kṛṣṇa’s devotees want to teach Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and Kṛṣṇa conscious advancement. Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization. Such endeavors are *jagato’hitaḥ;* that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general. *Kṣayāya:* such activities lead to annihilation. One who understands the purpose of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and seriously take part in it. One should not endeavor for *ugra-karma,* or unnecessary work for sense gratification. *Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti* (*Bhāg.* 5.5.4). Simply for sense gratification, people make plans for material happiness. *Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān* (*Bhāg.* 7.9.43). They do this because they are all *vimūḍhas,* rascals. For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy, not understanding the importance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple devotees of brainwashing. Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, but Kṛṣṇa will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.

**To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future in this Age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him one will be freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of material existence. \[In other words, He acted so that all future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness stated in Bhagavad-gītā, could be relieved from the pangs of material existence.\]**

### Purport

The Lord’s activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām*) take place side by side. Kṛṣṇa actually appears for the deliverance of the *sādhus,* or *bhaktas,* but by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Kṛṣṇa is liberated. Whether the Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the demons and the devotees.

यस्मिन् सत्कर्णपीयुषे यशस्तीर्थवरे सकृत् । श्रोत्राञ्जलिरुपस्पृश्य धुनुते कर्मवासनाम् ॥ ६२ ॥

### Verse text

*yasmin sat-karṇa-pīyuṣe  
yaśas-tīrtha-vare sakṛt  
śrotrāñjalir upaspṛśya  
dhunute karma-vāsanām*

### Synonyms

*yasmin* — in the history of the transcendental activities of Kṛṣṇa upon the surface of the earth; *sat*-*karṇa*-*pīyuṣe* — who pleases the demands of the transcendental, purified ears; *yaśaḥ*-*tīrtha*-*vare* — keeping oneself in the best of holy places by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord; *sakṛt* — once only, immediately; *śrotra*-*añjaliḥ* — in the form of hearing the transcendental message; *upaspṛśya* — touching (exactly like the water of the Ganges); *dhunute* — destroys; *karma*-*vāsanām* — the strong desire for fruitive activities.

### Translation

**Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.**

### Purport

When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they are no longer interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve freedom from the material world. For sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of *janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi* — birth, death, old age and disease — but the devotee, simply by hearing the message of *Bhagavad-gītā* and further relishing the narrations of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* becomes so pure that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities. At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are being attracted by Kṛṣṇa consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement. But they cannot possibly check this movement or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions. Here the words *śrotrāñjalir upaspṛśya* indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities. *Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam*. Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the devotees are freed from such activities. The devotees are situated in liberation (*brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*), and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.

### Translation

**Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vṛṣṇi, Andhaka, Madhu, Śūrasena, Daśārha, Kuru, Sṛñjaya and Pāṇḍu, Lord Kṛṣṇa performed various activities. By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His instructions and His uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His transcendental body, pleased all of human society.**

### Purport

The words *nṛlokaṁ ramayām āsa mūrtyā sarvāṅga-ramyayā* are significant. Kṛṣṇa is the original form. Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word *mūrtyā.* The word *mūrti* means “form.” Kṛṣṇa, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of His transcendental body (*yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi*). The Lord is *narākṛti,* exactly resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word *sarvāṅga-ramyayā* informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling face, every part of His body — His hands, His legs, His chest — is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.

### Translation

**Kṛṣṇa’s face is decorated with ornaments, such as earrings resembling sharks. His ears are beautiful, His cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to everyone. Whoever sees Lord Kṛṣṇa sees a festival. His face and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.**

### Purport

As stated by the Lord Himself in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.3):

*manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu  
kaścid yatati siddhaye  
yatatām api siddhānāṁ  
kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ*

“Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.” Unless one is qualified to understand Kṛṣṇa, one cannot appreciate the presence of Kṛṣṇa on earth. Among the Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas, Pāṇḍavas and many other kings intimately related with Kṛṣṇa, the intimate relationship between Kṛṣṇa and the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana is especially to be noted. That relationship is described in this verse by the words *nityotsavaṁ na tatṛpur dṛśibhiḥ pibantyaḥ.* The inhabitants of Vṛndāvana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the *gopīs* and Kṛṣṇa’s father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw Kṛṣṇa’s beautiful features constantly. Seeing Kṛṣṇa is described here as *nitya-utsava,* a daily festival. The inhabitants of Vṛndāvana saw Kṛṣṇa almost every moment, but when Kṛṣṇa left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the *gopīs* were very much afflicted because they saw Kṛṣṇa walking on the sand and thought that Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone. By even thinking of this, the *gopīs* were affected, and they cried at home. These *gopīs,* who were therefore the exalted friends of Kṛṣṇa, saw Kṛṣṇa constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of Kṛṣṇa, the *gopīs* condemned the creator, Lord Brahmā. Therefore the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, especially the beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Kṛṣṇa’s beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Kṛṣṇa’s head. The entire *Śrīmad-Bhāgavata Purāṇa* is the embodiment of Kṛṣṇa’s form, and the Tenth Canto is His face. This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is. Kṛṣṇa’s smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts — all this was minutely observed by the *gopīs,* who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Kṛṣṇa’s face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision. The beauty of Kṛṣṇa’s face was therefore much more appreciated by the *gopīs* than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Yaśodā Mātā, who was also interested in decorating the face of Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as līlā-puruṣottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father’s home and went to Vṛndāvana to expand His loving relationship with His confidential devotees. In Vṛndāvana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvārakā, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:* by all the *Vedas,* it is Kṛṣṇa who is to be known. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the *Vedas* and established the principles of *gṛhastha* life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Kṛṣṇa (*vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ*). To advance in human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in His householder life. The real purpose of Kṛṣṇa’s appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in Vṛndāvana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the *gopīs* and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.8), *paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām:* the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be *puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam* — the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person. Here also we find the words *utpādya teṣu puruṣaḥ.* Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is *puruṣa,* a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He *puruṣa,* a person, but He is the *līlā-puruṣottama,* the best of all persons.

### Translation

**Thereafter, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa created a misunderstanding between family members just to diminish the burden of the world. Simply by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and declared victory for Arjuna. Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.**

### Purport

*Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.* The mission of Lord Kṛṣṇa was performed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, for by the Lord’s mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord’s glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and enabled them to attain *sārūpya.* Finally, Lord Kṛṣṇa instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode. The Lord’s instructions in the form of *Bhagavad-gītā* are full of *jñāna* and *vairāgya,* knowledge and renunciation. In the human form of life, one must learn these two things — how to become detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life. This is the Lord’s mission (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām*). After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Vṛndāvana.
