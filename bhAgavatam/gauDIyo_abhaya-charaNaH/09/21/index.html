  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamīḍha and others.
The son of Bharadvāja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Bṛhatkṣatra, Jaya, Mahāvīrya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Saṅkṛti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a brāhmaṇa guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the brāhmaṇa. When the brāhmaṇa left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a śūdra appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the śūdra and himself. Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.">

  <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>
<p>This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamīḍha and others.</p>
<p>The son of Bharadvāja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Bṛhatkṣatra, Jaya, Mahāvīrya, Nara and Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Saṅkṛti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> When the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a <em>śūdra</em> appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the <em>śūdra</em> and himself. Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.</p>
<p>Garga, the son of Bharadvāja, had a son named Śini, and Śini’s son was Gārgya. Although Gārgya was a <em>kṣatriya</em> by birth, his sons became <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> The son of Mahāvīrya was Duritakṣaya, whose sons were Trayyāruṇi, Kavi and Puṣkarāruṇi. Although these three sons were born of a <em>kṣatriya</em> king, they also achieved the position of <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> The son of Bṛhatkṣatra constructed the city of Hastināpura and was known as Hastī. His sons were Ajamīḍha, Dvimīḍha and Purumīḍha.</p>
<p>From Ajamīḍha came Priyamedha and other <em>brāhmaṇas</em> and also a son named Bṛhadiṣu. The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Bṛhadiṣu were Bṛhaddhanu, Bṛhatkāya, Jayadratha, Viśada and Syenajit. From Syenajit came four sons — Rucirāśva, Dṛḍhahanu, Kāśya and Vatsa. From Rucirāśva came a son named Pāra, whose sons were Pṛthusena and Nīpa, and from Nīpa came one hundred sons. Another son of Nīpa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Viṣvaksena; from Viṣvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallāṭa.</p>
<p>The son of Dvimīḍha was Yavīnara, and from Yavīnara came many sons and grandsons, such as Kṛtimān, Satyadhṛti, Dṛḍhanemi, Supārśva, Sumati, Sannatimān, Kṛtī, Nīpa, Udgrāyudha, Kṣemya, Suvīra, Ripuñjaya and Bahuratha. Purumīḍha had no sons, but Ajamīḍha, in addition to his other sons, had a son named Nīla, whose son was Śānti. The descendants of Śānti were Suśānti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyāśva. Bharmyāśva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> Mudgala had twins — a son, Divodāsa, and a daughter, Ahalyā. From Ahalyā, by her husband, Gautama, Śatānanda was born. The son of Śatānanda was Satyadhṛti, and his son was Śaradvān. Śaradvān’s son was known as Kṛpa, and Śaradvān’s daughter, known as Kṛpī, became the wife of Droṇācārya.</p>

Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and his family were about to eat, a brāhmaṇa guest arrived.</strong></p>

<p>Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord both in the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> and in the <em>caṇḍāla.</em> This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (5.18):</p>
<p><em>vidyā-vinaya-sampanne<br>
brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br>
śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br>
paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ</em></p>
<p>“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste].” A <em>paṇḍita,</em> or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called <em>daridra-nārāyaṇa,</em> or “poor Nārāyaṇa,” Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Nārāyaṇa is present in the heart of one who is <em>daridra,</em> or poor, the poor man should be called <em>daridra-nārāyaṇa</em> is a wrong conception. By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Nārāyaṇa. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<em>hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ</em>). It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Māyāvāda philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.</p>

<p>As it is said:</p>
<p><em>kṛṣṇa — sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra<br>

<p>Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure Kṛṣṇa conscious person there can be no existence of <em>māyā.</em> The Lord Himself says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.14):</p>
<p><em>daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī<br>
mama māyā duratyayā<br>
mām eva ye prapadyante<br>
māyām etāṁ taranti te</em></p>
<p>“This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.” If one wants to be free from the influence of <em>māyā,</em> the illusory energy, one must become Kṛṣṇa conscious and always keep Kṛṣṇa prominent within the core of his heart. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (<em>man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru</em>). In this way, by always being Kṛṣṇa-minded or Kṛṣṇa conscious, one can surpass the influence of <em>māyā</em> (<em>māyām etāṁ taranti te</em>). Because Rantideva was Kṛṣṇa conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word <em>svapnavat</em> is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one’s dreams. When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Kṛṣṇa conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.</p>

<p>The best <em>yogīs</em> or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (6.47):</p>

<p>“Of all <em>yogīs,</em> he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in <em>yoga</em> and is the highest of all.” The best <em>yogī</em> is he who constantly thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, by the king’s transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said that a Vaiṣṇava is meritorious in proportion to the number of devotees he has created. A Vaiṣṇava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word <em>rantidevānuvartinaḥ</em> indicates that Rantideva’s officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaiṣṇavas by his association. In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or <em>mahā-bhāgavata.</em> <em>Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ:</em> one should render service to such <em>mahātmās,</em> for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has also said, <em>chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:</em> one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaiṣṇava, the door to liberation is open.</p>

<p>This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that the orders of society — <em>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</em> and <em>śūdra</em> — are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (<em>guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ</em>). All the descendants of Ajamīḍha, who was a <em>kṣatriya,</em> became <em>brāhmaṇas.</em> This was certainly because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons of <em>brāhmaṇas</em> or <em>kṣatriyas</em> become <em>vaiśyas</em> (<em>brāhmaṇa-vaiśyatāṁ gatāḥ</em>). When a <em>kṣatriya</em> or <em>brāhmaṇa</em> adopts the occupation or duty of a <em>vaiśya</em> (<em>kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyam</em>), he is certainly counted as a <em>vaiśya.</em> On the other hand, if one is born a <em>vaiśya,</em> by his activities he can become a <em>brāhmaṇa.</em> This is confirmed by Nārada Muni. <em>Yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.</em> The members of the <em>varṇas,</em> or social orders — <em>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</em> and <em>śūdra</em> — must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.</p>

<p>The Śuka mentioned here is different from the Śukadeva Gosvāmī who spoke <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</em> Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Vyāsadeva, is described in great detail in the <em>Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa.</em> There it is said that Vyāsadeva maintained the daughter of Jābāli as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of <em>māyā.</em> Vyāsadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by <em>māyā,</em> but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children. Vyāsadeva then went to Dvārakā and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyāsadeva’s request, went to Vyāsadeva’s cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by <em>māyā.</em> Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a <em>parivrājakācārya.</em> When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the boy created a duplicate Śukadeva, who later entered family life. Therefore, the <em>śuka-kanyā,</em> or daughter of Śukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Śukadeva. The original Śukadeva was a lifelong <em>brahmacārī.</em></p>

<p><strong>While Mahārāja Śāntanu was on a hunting excursion, he saw the male and female children lying in the forest, and out of compassion he took them home. Consequently, the male child was known as Kṛpa, and the female child was named Kṛpī. Kṛpī later became the wife of Droṇācārya.</strong></p>
