CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

This chapter gives the history of King Yayāti, the son of Nahuṣa. Among Yayāti’s five sons, the youngest son, Pūru, accepted Yayāti’s invalidity.

When Nahuṣa, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, Yati, took *sannyāsa,* and therefore the next son, Yayāti, was enthroned as king. By providence, Yayāti married the daughter of Śukrācārya. Śukrācārya was a *brāhmaṇa* and Yayāti a *kṣatriya,* but Yayāti married her nonetheless. Śukrācārya’s daughter, named Devayānī, had a girlfriend named Śarmiṣṭhā, who was the daughter of Vṛṣaparvā. King Yayāti married Śarmiṣṭhā also. The history of this marriage is as follows. Once Śarmiṣṭhā was sporting in the water with thousands of her girlfriends, and Devayānī was also there. When the young girls saw Lord Śiva, seated on his bull with Umā, they immediately dressed themselves, but Śarmiṣṭhā mistakenly put on Devayānī’s clothes. Devayānī, being very angry, rebuked Śarmiṣṭhā, who also became very angry and responded by rebuking Devayānī and throwing her into a well. By chance, King Yayāti came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayānī and rescued her. Thus Devayānī accepted Mahārāja Yayāti as her husband. Thereafter, Devayānī, crying loudly, told her father about Śarmiṣṭhā’s behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, Śukrācārya was very angry and wanted to chastise Vṛṣaparvā, Śarmiṣṭhā’s father. Vṛṣaparvā, however, satisfied Śukrācārya by offering Śarmiṣṭhā as Devayānī’s maidservant. Thus Śarmiṣṭhā, as the maidservant of Devayānī, also went to the house of Devayānī’s husband. When Śarmiṣṭhā found her friend Devayānī with a son she also desired to have a son. Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested Mahārāja Yayāti for sex. When Śarmiṣṭhā became pregnant also, Devayānī was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father’s house and told her father everything. Śukrācārya again became angry and cursed Mahārāja Yayāti to become old, but when Yayāti begged Śukrācārya to be merciful to him, Śukrācārya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yayāti exchanged his old age for the youth of his youngest son, Pūru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*yatir yayātiḥ saṁyātir  
āyatir viyatiḥ kṛtiḥ  
ṣaḍ ime nahuṣasyāsann  
indriyāṇīva dehinaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *yatiḥ* — Yati; *yayātiḥ* — Yayāti; *saṁyātiḥ* — Saṁyāti; *āyatiḥ* — Āyati; *viyatiḥ* — Viyati; *kṛtiḥ* — Kṛti; *ṣaṭ* — six; *ime* — all of them; *nahuṣasya* — of King Nahuṣa; *āsan* — were; *indriyāṇi* — the (six) senses; *iva* — like; *dehinaḥ* — of an embodied soul.

### Devanagari

राज्यं नैच्छद् यति- पित्रा दत्तं तत्परिणामवित् ।  
यत्र प्रविष्ट- पुरुष आत्मानं नावबुध्यते ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*rājyaṁ naicchad yatiḥ pitrā  
dattaṁ tat-pariṇāmavit  
yatra praviṣṭaḥ puruṣa  
ātmānaṁ nāvabudhyate*

### Synonyms

*rājyam* — the kingdom; *na* *aicchat* — did not accept; *yatiḥ* — the eldest son, Yati; *pitrā* — by his father; *dattam* — offered; *tat*-*pariṇāma*-*vit* — knowing the result of becoming powerful as a king; *yatra* — wherein; *praviṣṭaḥ* — having entered; *puruṣaḥ* — such a person; *ātmānam* — self-realization; *na* — not; *avabudhyate* — will take seriously and understand.

### Translation

**When one enters the post of king or head of the government, one cannot understand the meaning of self-realization. Knowing this, Yati, the eldest son of Nahuṣa, did not accept the power to rule, although it was offered by his father.**

### Purport

Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities. *Kṣatriyas* are generally endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one loses the chance for human perfection. Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* This hearing is described as *nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.* Mahārāja Parīkṣit was involved in politics, but because at the end of his life he heard *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he attained perfection very easily. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore suggested:

*sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir  
ye prāyaśo ’jita jito ’py asi tais tri-lokyām*

(*Bhāg.* 10.14.3)

Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.

### Translation

**Because Nahuṣa, the father of Yayāti, molested Indra’s wife, Śacī, who then complained to Agastya and other brāhmaṇas, these saintly brāhmaṇas cursed Nahuṣa to fall from the heavenly planets and be degraded to the status of a python. Consequently, Yayāti became the king.**

śrī-rājovāca

### Translation

**Mahārāja Parīkṣit said: Śukrācārya was a very powerful brāhmaṇa, and Mahārāja Yayāti was a kṣatriya. Therefore I am curious to know how there occurred this pratiloma marriage between a kṣatriya and a brāhmaṇa.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic system, marriages between *kṣatriyas* and *kṣatriyas* or between *brāhmaṇas* and *brāhmaṇas* are the general custom. If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these marriages are of two types, namely *anuloma* and *pratiloma.* *Anuloma,* marriage between a *brāhmaṇa* and the daughter of a *kṣatriya,* is permissible, but *pratiloma,* marriage between a *kṣatriya* and the daughter of a *brāhmaṇa,* is not generally allowed. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit was curious about how Śukrācārya, a powerful *brāhmaṇa,* could accept the principle of *pratiloma.* Mahārāja Parīkṣit was eager to know the cause for this uncommon marriage.

And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhṛgu. Yet although this woman’s father, being among the demons, is our disciple, she has put on my dress, exactly like a śūdra taking charge of Vedic knowledge.**

### Purport

Crows have no independent life; they fully depend on the remnants of foodstuffs thrown by householders into the garbage tank. Therefore, because a *brāhmaṇa* depends on his disciples, when Śarmiṣṭhā was heavily rebuked by Devayānī she charged Devayānī with belonging to a family of crowlike beggars. It is the nature of women to fight verbally at even a slight provocation. As we see from this incident, this has been their nature for a long, long time.

Let me not be touched by others, for our relationship as husband and wife has been made possible by providence, not by any human being.**

### Purport

While taking Devayānī out of the well, King Yayāti must certainly have appreciated her youthful beauty, and therefore he might have asked her which caste she belonged to. Thus Devayānī would have immediately replied, “We are already married because you have accepted my hand.” Uniting the hands of the bride and bridegroom is a system perpetually existing in all societies. Therefore, as soon as Yayāti accepted Devayānī’s hand, they could be regarded as married. Because Devayānī was enamored with the hero Yayāti, she requested him not to change his mind and let another come to marry her.

### Translation

**Because of falling in the well, I met you. Indeed, this has been arranged by providence. After I cursed Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Bṛhaspati, he cursed me by saying that I would not have a brāhmaṇa for a husband. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife of a brāhmaṇa.**

### Purport

Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Bṛhaspati, had been a student of Śukrācārya, from whom he had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely. This art, called *mṛta-sañjīvanī,* was especially used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a soldier’s body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of *mṛta-sañjīvanī.* This art was known to Śukrācārya and many others, and Kaca, the son of Bṛhaspati, became Śukrācārya’s student to learn it. Devayānī desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Śukrācārya, looked upon the *guru’s* daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devayānī angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of *mṛta-sañjīvanī* from her father, it would be useless. When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayānī never to have a husband who was a *brāhmaṇa.* Because Devayānī liked Yayāti, who was a *kṣatriya,* she requested him to accept her as his bona fide wife. Although this would be *pratiloma-vivāha,* a marriage between the daughter of a high family and the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Because such a marriage is not sanctioned by regular scriptures, King Yayāti did not like it, but because it was arranged by providence and because he was attracted by Devayānī’s beauty, he accepted her request.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes of the boy and girl who were to be married. If according to astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect, the match was called *yoṭaka* and the marriage would be accepted. Even fifty years ago, this system was current in Hindu society. Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl, without this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place. A person is born in one of three categories, known as *deva-gaṇa, manuṣya-gaṇa* and *rakṣasa-gaṇa.* In different parts of the universe there are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people resemble demigods whereas others resemble demons. If according to astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there were calculations of *pratiloma* and *anuloma.* The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy, whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness. Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find many divorces. Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly one’s marriage would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great that the wife would voluntarily die when her husband died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now, of course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal society. Marriage now takes place simply by agreement. *Dāmpatye ’bhirucir hetuḥ* (*Bhāg.* 12.2.3). The word *abhiruci* means “agreement.” If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But when the Vedic system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce.

### Synonyms

*durmanāḥ* — being very unhappy; *bhagavān* — the most powerful; *kāvyaḥ* — Śukrācārya; *paurohityam* — the business of priesthood; *vigarhayan* — condemning; *stuvan* — praising; *vṛttim* — the profession; *ca* — and; *kāpotīm* — of collecting grains from the field; *duhitrā* — with his daughter; *saḥ* — he (Śukrācārya); *yayau* — went; *purāt* — from his own residence.

### Translation

**As Śukrācārya listened to what had happened to Devayānī, his mind was very much aggrieved. Condemning the profession of priesthood and praising the profession of uñcha-vṛtti \[collecting grains from the fields\], he left home with his daughter.**

### Purport

When a *brāhmaṇa* adopts the profession of a *kapota,* or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the field. This is called *uñcha-vṛtti.* A *brāhmaṇa* who takes to this *uñcha-vṛtti* profession is called first class because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a *brāhmaṇa* or *sannyāsī,* one does better if he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance. Śukrācārya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter’s complaint he had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the profession of priesthood. In his heart, Śukrācārya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.

**The powerful Śukrācārya was angry for a few moments, but upon being satisfied he said to Vṛṣaparvā: My dear King, kindly fulfill the desire of Devayānī, for she is my daughter and in this world I cannot give her up or neglect her.**

### Purport

Sometimes a great personality like Śukrācārya cannot neglect sons and daughters, for sons and daughters are by nature dependent on their father and the father has affection for them. Although Śukrācārya knew that the quarrel between Devayānī and Śarmiṣṭhā was childish, as Devayānī’s father he had to side with his daughter. He did not like to do this, but he was obliged to because of affection. He plainly admitted that although he should not have asked the King for mercy for his daughter, because of affection he could not avoid doing so.

He gave his daughter Śarmiṣṭhā to Devayānī, and Śarmiṣṭhā served Devayānī like a slave, along with thousands of other women.**

### Purport

In the beginning of these affairs concerning Śarmiṣṭhā and Devayānī, we saw that Śarmiṣṭhā had many friends. Now these friends became maidservants of Devayānī. When a girl married a *kṣatriya* king, it was customary for all her girlfriends to go with her to her husband’s house. For instance, when Vasudeva married Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who accompanied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of his wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children were accepted as *dāsī-putra,* the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen. In the history of Kṛṣṇa’s household life we find that Kṛṣṇa married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct queens, and Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments.

### Translation

**When Princess Śarmiṣṭhā begged King Yayāti for a son, the King was certainly aware of the principles of religion, and therefore he agreed to fulfill her desire. Although he remembered the warning of Śukrācārya, he thought of this union as the desire of the Supreme, and thus he had sex with Śarmiṣṭhā.**

### Purport

King Yayāti was completely aware of the duty of a *kṣatriya.* When a *kṣatriya* is approached by a woman, he cannot deny her. This is a religious principle. Consequently, when Dharmarāja, Yudhiṣṭhira, saw Arjuna unhappy after Arjuna returned from Dvārakā, he asked whether Arjuna had refused a woman who had begged for a son. Although Mahārāja Yayāti remembered Śukrācārya’s warning, he could not refuse Śarmiṣṭhā. He thought it wise to give her a son, and thus he had sexual intercourse with her after her menstrual period. This kind of lust is not against religious principles. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.11), *dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo ’smi:* sex life not contrary to the principles of religion is sanctioned by Kṛṣṇa. Because Śarmiṣṭhā, the daughter of a king, had begged Yayāti for a son, their combination was not lust but an act of religion.

When King Yayāti said that he had not yet satisfied his lusty desires with Śukrācārya’s daughter, Śukrācārya saw that it was against the interests of his own daughter for Yayāti to continue in old age and invalidity, for certainly his lusty daughter would not be satisfied. Therefore Śukrācārya blessed his son-in-law by saying that he could exchange his old age for someone else’s youth. He indicated that if Yayāti’s son would exchange his youth for Yayāti’s old age, Yayāti could continue to enjoy sex with Devayānī.

*mātāmaha-kṛtāṁ vatsa  
na tṛpto viṣayeṣv aham  
vayasā bhavadīyena  
raṁsye katipayāḥ samāḥ*

### Synonyms

*mātāmaha*-*kṛtām* — given by your maternal grandfather, Śukrācārya; *vatsa* — my dear son; *na* — not; *tṛptaḥ* — satisfied; *viṣayeṣu* — in sex life, sense gratification; *aham* — I (am); *vayasā* — by age; *bhavadīyena* — of your good self; *raṁsye* — I shall enjoy sex life; *katipayāḥ* — for a few; *samāḥ* — years.

### Translation

**My dear son, I am not yet satisfied in my sexual desires. But if you are kind to me, you can take the old age given by your maternal grandfather, and I may take your youth so that I may enjoy life for a few years more.**

### Purport

This is the nature of lusty desires. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20) it is said, *kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ:* when one is too attached to sense gratification, he actually loses his sense. The word *hṛta-jñānāḥ* refers to one who has lost his sense. Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his son to exchange youth for old age. Of course, the entire world is under such illusion. Therefore it is said that everyone is *pramattaḥ,* or exclusively mad. *Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma:* when one becomes almost like a madman, he indulges in sex and sense gratification. Sex and sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one achieves perfection when he has no desires for sex. This is possible only when one is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.

*yadavadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde  
nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt  
tadavadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne  
bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu-niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca*

“Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste.” Sexual desire can be stopped only when one is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, and not otherwise. As long as one has desires for sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different species or forms. But although the forms may differ, the business of sex is the same. Therefore it is said, *punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām.* Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body to another, with the same business of “chewing the chewed,” tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod, and so on.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*yaduḥ* *uvāca* — Yadu, the eldest son to Yayāti, replied; *na* *utsahe* — I am not enthusiastic; *jarasā* — with your old age and invalidity; *sthātum* — to remain; *antarā* — while in youth; *prāptayā* — accepted; *tava* — your; *aviditvā* — without experiencing; *sukham* — happiness; *grāmyam* — material or bodily; *vaitṛṣṇyam* — indifference to material enjoyment; *na* — does not; *eti* — attain; *pūruṣaḥ* — a person.

### Translation

**Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age, although you also were a young man. But I do not welcome your old age and invalidity, for unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation.**

### Purport

Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life. Therefore the *varṇāśrama* institution is most scientific. It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, *niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya:* one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead, must be *niṣkiñcana,* free from all affinity for material enjoyment. *Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam:* unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman. Devotional service is rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless one attains the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is already on the Brahman platform.

*māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa  
bhakti-yogena sevate  
sa guṇān samatītyaitān  
brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*

“One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.” (Bg. 14.26) If one attains devotional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. *Varṇāśrama* therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation. Yadu, the son of Mahārāja Yayāti, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future.

Mahārāja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse, *turvasuś coditaḥ pitrā druhyuś cānuś ca bhārata/ pratyācakhyur adharmajñāḥ.* Mahārāja Yadu’s brothers refused to accept their father’s proposal because they were not completely aware of *dharma.* To accept orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one’s father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers of Mahārāja Yadu refused their father’s order, this was certainly irreligious. Mahārāja Yadu’s refusal, however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto, *yadoś ca dharma-śīlasya:* Mahārāja Yadu was completely aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord. Mahārāja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord’s service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one’s being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have actually seen that many *sannyāsīs* who accept *sannyāsa* prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed. Therefore the general process is to go through *gṛhastha* life and *vānaprastha* life and finally come to *sannyāsa* and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. Mahārāja Yadu was ready to accept his father’s order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father’s old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances. Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, because Yadu was eager to see the Lord’s appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, Yadu refused to accept his father’s proposal. This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu’s purpose was to serve the Lord. Because Yadu was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed in the prayers of Kuntī, *yadoḥ priyasyānvavāye.* Yadu was very dear to Kṛṣṇa, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu’s dynasty. In conclusion, Mahārāja Yadu should not be considered *adharma-jña,* ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (*catuḥ-sana*), who refused the order of their father, Brahmā, for the sake of a better cause. Because the four Kumāras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as *brahmacārīs,* their refusal to obey their father’s order was not irreligious.

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Yayāti similarly requested his sons Turvasu, Druhyu and Anu to exchange their youth for his old age, but because they were unaware of religious principles, they thought that their flickering youth was eternal, and therefore they refused to carry out their father’s order.**

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*pūruḥ* *uvāca* — Pūru said; *kaḥ* — what; *nu* — indeed; *loke* — in this world; *manuṣya*-*indra* — O Your Majesty, best of human beings; *pituḥ* — the father; *ātma*-*kṛtaḥ* — who has given this body; *pumān* — a person; *pratikartum* — to repay; *kṣamaḥ* — is able; *yasya* — of whom; *prasādāt* — by the mercy; *vindate* — one enjoys; *param* — superior life.

### Translation

**Pūru replied: O Your Majesty, who in this world can repay his debt to his father? By the mercy of one’s father, one gets the human form of life, which can enable one to become an associate of the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

The father gives the seed of the body, and this seed gradually grows and develops until one ultimately attains the developed human body, with consciousness higher than that of the animals. In the human body one can be elevated to the higher planets, and, furthermore, if one cultivates Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can return home, back to Godhead. This important human body is obtained by the grace of the father, and therefore everyone is indebted to his father. Of course, in other lives one also gets a father and mother; even cats and dogs have fathers and mothers. But in the human form of life the father and mother can award their son the greatest benediction by teaching him to become a devotee. When one becomes a devotee, he achieves the greatest benediction because he completely averts the repetition of birth and death. Therefore the father who trains his child in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the most benevolent father in this world. It is said:

*janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya  
kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei*

Everyone gets a father and mother, but if one gets the benediction of Kṛṣṇa and *guru,* he can conquer material nature and return home, back to Godhead.

*uttamaḥ* — the best; *cintitam* — considering the father’s idea; *kuryāt* — acts accordingly; *prokta*-*kārī* — one who acts on the order of the father; *tu* — indeed; *madhyamaḥ* — mediocre; *adhamaḥ* — lower class; *aśraddhayā* — without any faith; *kuryāt* — acts; *akartā* — unwilling to do; *uccaritam* — like stool; *pituḥ* — of the father.

### Translation

**A son who acts by anticipating what his father wants him to do is first class, one who acts upon receiving his father’s order is second class, and one who executes his father’s order irreverently is third class. But a son who refuses his father’s order is like his father’s stool.**

### Purport

Pūru, Yayāti’s last son, immediately accepted his father’s proposal, for although he was the youngest, he was very qualified. Pūru thought, “I should have accepted my father’s proposal before he asked, but I did not. Therefore I am not a first-class son. I am second class. But I do not wish to become the lowest type of son, who is compared to his father’s stool.” One Indian poet has spoken of *putra* and *mūtra.* *Putra* means “son,” and *mūtra* means “urine.” Both a son and urine come from the same genitals. If a son is an obedient devotee of the Lord he is called *putra,* or a real son; otherwise, if he is not learned and is not a devotee, a son is nothing better than urine.

### Purport

As stated by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.19):

*bahūnāṁ janmanām ante  
jñānavān māṁ prapadyate  
vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti  
sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ*

“After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, is one with the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Everything is in Him in the beginning, and at the end all manifestations enter into Him. He is situated in everyone’s heart (*sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ*). And from Him everything has emanated (*janmādy asya yataḥ*). All material manifestations, however, are temporary. The word *svapna* means “dreams,” *māyā* means “illusion,” and *manoratha* means “mental creations.” Dreams, illusions and mental creations are temporary. Similarly, all material creation is temporary, but Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the eternal Absolute Truth.

The *kad-indriya,* or unpurified senses, can be purified if one engages the senses and the mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. *Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.* One must be freed from all designations. When one identifies himself with the material world, his senses are impure. But when one achieves spiritual realization and identifies himself as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately. Engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called *bhakti.* *Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.* One may enjoy the senses for many thousands of years, but unless one purifies the senses, one cannot be happy.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “King Yayāti Regains His Youth.”*
