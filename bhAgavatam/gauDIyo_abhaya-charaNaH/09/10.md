CHAPTER TEN

This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Rāmacandra appeared in the dynasty of Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga. It also describes the Lord’s activities, telling how He killed Rāvaṇa and returned to Ayodhyā, the capital of His kingdom.

The son of Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga was Dīrghabāhu, and his son was Raghu. The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Daśaratha, and the son of Daśaratha was Lord Rāmacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion — as Lord Rāmacandra, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna — great sages like Vālmīki who were actually in knowledge of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes these pastimes in brief.

Lord Rāmacandra went with Viśvāmitra and killed Rākṣasas like Mārīca. After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sītā and cut down the prestige of Paraśurāma. To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā. There He cut off the nose of Śūrpaṇakhā and killed the associates of Rāvaṇa, headed by Khara and Dūṣaṇa. Rāvaṇa’s kidnapping of Sītādevī was the beginning of this demon’s misfortune. When Mārīca assumed the form of a golden deer, Lord Rāmacandra went to bring the deer to please Sītādevī, but in the meantime Rāvaṇa took advantage of the Lord’s absence to kidnap her. When Sītādevī was kidnapped, Lord Rāmacandra, accompanied by Lakṣmaṇa, searched for her throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met Jaṭāyu. Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vāli and established a friendly relationship with Sugrīva. After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry. Then Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to bridge the ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhīṣaṇa, He attacked Rāvaṇa’s capital, Laṅkā. Previously, Hanumān, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Laṅkā, and now, with the help of Lakṣmaṇa, the forces of Lord Rāmacandra killed all the Rākṣasa soldiers. Then Lord Rāmacandra personally killed Rāvaṇa. Mandodarī and other wives lamented for Rāvaṇa, and in accordance with Lord Rāmacandra’s order, Vibhīṣaṇa performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family. Lord Rāmacandra then gave Vibhīṣaṇa the right to rule Laṅkā and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered Sītādevī from the Aśoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhyā, where He was received by His brother Bharata. When Lord Rāmacandra entered Ayodhyā, Bharata brought His wooden shoes, Vibhīṣaṇa and Sugrīva held a whisk and fan, Hanumān carried an umbrella, Śatrughna carried the Lord’s bow and two quivers, and Sītādevī carried a waterpot containing water from holy places. Aṅgada carried a sword, and Jāmbavān (Ṛkṣarāja) carried a shield. After Lord Rāmacandra, accompanied by Lord Lakṣmaṇa and mother Sītādevī, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasiṣṭha enthroned Him as King. The chapter ends with a short description of Lord Rāmacandra’s rule in Ayodhyā.

### Synonyms

*tasya* — of him, Mahārāja Daśaratha; *api* — also; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *eṣaḥ* — all of them; *sākṣāt* — directly; *brahma*-*mayaḥ* — the Supreme Parabrahman, the Absolute Truth; *hariḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *aṁśa*-*aṁśena* — by an expansion of a plenary portion; *caturdhā* — by fourfold expansions; *agāt* — accepted; *putratvam* — sonhood; *prārthitaḥ* — being prayed for; *suraiḥ* — by the demigods; *rāma* — Lord Rāmacandra; *lakṣmaṇa* — Lord Lakṣmaṇa; *bharata* — Lord Bharata; *śatrughnāḥ* — and Lord Śatrughna; *iti* — thus; *saṁjñayā* — by different names.

### Translation

**Being prayed for by the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth Himself, directly appeared with His expansion and expansions of the expansion. Their holy names were Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna. These celebrated incarnations thus appeared in four forms as the sons of Mahārāja Daśaratha.**

### Purport

Lord Rāmacandra and His brothers, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, are all *viṣṇu-tattva,* not *jīva-tattva.* The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into many, many forms. *Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam*. Although they are one and the same, *viṣṇu-tattva* has many forms and incarnations. As confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.39), *rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan.* The Lord is situated in many forms, such as Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, and these forms may exist in any part of His creation. All these forms exist permanently, eternally, as individual Personalities of Godhead, and they resemble many candles, all equally powerful. Lord Rāmacandra, Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata and Śatrughna, who, being *viṣṇu-tattva,* are all equally powerful, became the sons of Mahārāja Daśaratha in response to prayers by the demigods.

श्रुतं हि वर्णितं भूरि त्वया सीतापतेर्मुहु- ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*tasyānucaritaṁ rājann  
ṛṣibhis tattva-darśibhiḥ  
śrutaṁ hi varṇitaṁ bhūri  
tvayā sītā-pater muhuḥ*

### Synonyms

*tasya* — of Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Rāmacandra and His brothers; *anucaritam* — transcendental activities; *rājan* — O King (Mahārāja Parīkṣit); *ṛṣibhiḥ* — by great sages or saintly persons; *tattva*-*darśibhiḥ* — by persons who know the Absolute Truth; *śrutam* — have all been heard; *hi* — indeed; *varṇitam* — as they have been so nicely described; *bhūri* — many; *tvayā* — by you; *sītā*-*pateḥ* — of Lord Rāmacandra, the husband of mother Sītā; *muhuḥ* — more than often.

### Translation

**O King Parīkṣit, the transcendental activities of Lord Rāmacandra have been described by great saintly persons who have seen the truth. Because you have heard again and again about Lord Rāmacandra, the husband of mother Sītā, I shall describe these activities only in brief. Please listen.**

### Purport

Modern Rākṣasas, posing as educationally advanced merely because they have doctorates, have tried to prove that Lord Rāmacandra is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person. But those who are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the descriptions of Lord Rāmacandra and His activities only as presented by *tattva-darśīs,* those who know the Absolute Truth. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:

*tad viddhi praṇipātena  
paripraśnena sevayā  
upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ  
jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ*

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” Unless one is *tattva-darśī,* in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the activities of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore although there are many so-called *Rāmāyaṇas,* or histories of Lord Rāmacandra’s activities, some of them are not actually authoritative. Sometimes Lord Rāmacandra’s activities are described in terms of one’s own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments. But the characteristics of Lord Rāmacandra should not be handled as something imaginary. While describing the history of Lord Rāmacandra, Śukadeva Gosvāmī told Mahārāja Parīkṣit, “You have already heard about the activities of Lord Rāmacandra.” Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago there were many *Rāmāyaṇas,* or histories of Lord Rāmacandra’s activities, and there are many still. But we must select only those books written by *tattva-darśīs* (*jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ*), not the books of so-called scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate. This is a warning by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. *Ṛṣibhis tattva-darśibhiḥ.* Although the *Rāmāyaṇa* composed by Vālmīki is a huge literature, the same activities are summarized here by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in a few verses.

### Translation

**To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Rāmacandra immediately gave up the position of king and, accompanied by His wife, mother Sītā, wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which were so delicate that they were unable to bear even the touch of Sītā’s palms. The Lord was also accompanied by Hanumān \[or by another monkey, Sugrīva\], king of the monkeys, and by His own younger brother Lord Lakṣmaṇa, both of whom gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the forest. Having cut off the nose and ears of Śūrpaṇakhā, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from mother Sītā. He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who then allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean. Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of Rāvaṇa to kill him, like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, Rāmacandra, give us all protection.**

### Translation

**O King, the pastimes of Lord Rāmacandra were wonderful, like those of a baby elephant. In the assembly where mother Sītā was to choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke the bow belonging to Lord Śiva. This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but Lord Rāmacandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother Sītā, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from Sītā’s home after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord Rāmacandra met Paraśurāma. Although Paraśurāma was very proud, having rid the earth of the royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be a kṣatriya of the royal order.**

### Translation

**Carrying out the order of His father, who was bound by a promise to his wife, Lord Rāmacandra left behind His kingdom, opulence, friends, well-wishers, residence and everything else, just as a liberated soul gives up his life, and went to the forest with Sītā.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Daśaratha had three wives. One of them, Kaikeyī, served him very pleasingly, and he therefore wanted to give her a benediction. Kaikeyī, however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it was necessary. At the time of the coronation of Prince Rāmacandra, Kaikeyī requested her husband to enthrone her son Bharata and send Rāmacandra to the forest. Mahārāja Daśaratha, being bound by his promise, ordered Rāmacandra to go to the forest, according to the dictation of his beloved. And the Lord, as an obedient son, accepted the order immediately. He left everything without hesitation, just as a liberated soul or great *yogī* gives up his life without material attraction.

### Translation

**When Rāmacandra entered the forest and Lakṣmaṇa was also absent, the worst of the Rākṣasas, Rāvaṇa, kidnapped Sītādevī, the daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the shepherd is absent. Then Lord Rāmacandra wandered in the forest with His brother Lakṣmaṇa as if very much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His personal example the condition of a person attached to women.**

### Purport

In this verse the words *strī-saṅgināṁ gatim iti* indicate that the condition of a person attached to women was shown by the Lord Himself. According to moral instructions, *gṛhe nārīṁ vivarjayet:* when one goes on a tour, one should not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still, as far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a condition as Lord Rāmacandra when banished by the order of His father. Whether in the forest or at home, if one is attached to women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His personal example.

Of course, this is the material side of *strī-saṅgī,* but the situation of Lord Rāmacandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material world. *Nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt:* Nārāyaṇa is beyond the material creation. Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of the material world. The separation of Lord Rāmacandra from Sītā is spiritually understood as *vipralambha,* which is an activity of the *hlādinī* potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the *śṛṅgāra-rasa,* the mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms called *sāttvika, sañcārī, vilāpa, mūrcchā* and *unmāda.* Thus when Lord Rāmacandra was separated from Sītā, all these spiritual symptoms were manifested. The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is *sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,* the eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss. Feeling separation from one’s beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss. As explained by Śrīla Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, *rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktiḥ:* the dealings of love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa are displayed as the pleasure potency of the Lord. The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all pleasure. Lord Rāmacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and materially. Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.11):

*avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā  
mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam  
paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto  
mama bhūta-maheśvaram*

One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead thinks of the Lord as an ordinary human being. But the Lord’s mind, intelligence and senses can never be affected by material conditions. This fact is further explained in the *Skanda Purāṇa,* as quoted by Madhvācārya:

*nitya-pūrṇa-sukha-jñāna-  
svarūpo ’sau yato vibhuḥ  
ato ’sya rāma ity ākhyā  
tasya duḥkhaṁ kuto ’ṇv api*

*tathāpi loka-śikṣārtham  
aduḥkho duḥkha-vartivat  
antarhitāṁ loka-dṛṣṭyā  
sītām āsīt smarann iva*

*jñāpanārthaṁ punar nitya-  
sambandhaḥ svātmanaḥ śriyāḥ  
ayodhyāyā vinirgacchan  
sarva-lokasya ceśvaraḥ  
pratyakṣaṁ tu śriyā sārdhaṁ  
jagāmānādir avyayaḥ*

*nakṣatra-māsa-gaṇitaṁ  
trayodaśa-sahasrakam  
brahmaloka-samaṁ cakre  
samastaṁ kṣiti-maṇḍalam*

*rāmo rāmo rāma iti  
sarveṣām abhavat tadā  
sarvoramamayo loko  
yadā rāmas tv apālayat*

It was actually impossible for Rāvaṇa to take away Sītā. The form of Sītā taken by Rāvaṇa was an illusory representation of mother Sītā — *māyā-sītā*. When Sītā was tested in the fire, this *māyā-sītā* was burnt, and the real Sītā came out of the fire.

A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a woman, however powerful she may be in the material world, must be given protection, for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited by Rākṣasas like Rāvaṇa. Here the words *vaideha-rāja-duhitari* indicate that before mother Sītā was married to Lord Rāmacandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-rāja. And when she was married she was protected by her husband. Therefore the conclusion is that a woman should always be protected. According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman’s being independent (*asamakṣam*), for a woman cannot protect herself independently.

### Purport

When Rāvaṇa kidnapped Sītā, he was obstructed on the way by Jaṭāyu, a large bird. But the powerful Rāvaṇa defeated Jaṭāyu in the fight and cut his wing. When Rāmacandra was searching for Sītā, He found Jaṭāyu almost dead and was informed that Sītā has been carried off by Rāvaṇa. When Jaṭāyu died, Lord Rāmacandra did the duty of a son by performing the funeral ceremony, and then He made friends with the monkeys to deliver Sītādevī.

Then the personified ocean fearfully approached Lord Rāmacandra, taking all paraphernalia to worship Him. Falling at the Lord’s lotus feet, the personified ocean spoke as follows.**

### Translation

The demigods are infatuated with the mode of goodness, the Prajāpatis with the mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of ignorance, but You are the master of all these qualities.**

### Purport

The word *jaḍa-dhiyaḥ* refers to intelligence like that of an animal. A person with such intelligence cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being beaten, an animal cannot understand the purpose of a man. Similarly, those who are dull-minded cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when punished severely by the modes of material nature, they begin to understand Him. A Hindi poet has said:

*duḥkha se saba hari bhaje  
sukha se bhaje koī  
sukha se agar hari bhaje  
duḥkha kāthāṅ se haya*

When one is distressed he goes to the church or temple to worship the Lord, but when opulent he forgets the Lord. Therefore, punishment by the Lord through material nature is necessary in human society, for without it men forget the supremacy of the Lord due to their dull, blunt intelligence.

### Synonyms

*kāmam* — as You like; *prayāhi* — You may go over my water; *jahi* — just conquer; *viśravasaḥ* — of Viśravā Muni; *avameham* — pollution, like urine; *trailokya* — for the three worlds; *rāvaṇam* — the person known as Rāvaṇa, the cause of weeping; *avāpnuhi* — regain; *vīra* — O great hero; *patnīm* — Your wife; *badhnīhi* — just construct; *setum* — a bridge; *iha* — here (on this water); *te* — of Your good self; *yaśasaḥ* — fame; *vitatyai* — to expand; *gāyanti* — will glorify; *dik*-*vijayinaḥ* — great heroes who have conquered all directions; *yam* — which (bridge); *upetya* — coming near; *bhūpāḥ* — great kings.

### Translation

**My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of Rāvaṇa, who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds. He is the son of Viśravā, but is condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sītādevī. O great hero, although my water presents no impediment to Your going to Laṅkā, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.**

### Purport

It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source — the genitals. When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here Rāvaṇa is compared to urine because he was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord Rāmacandra.

One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Rāmacandra is omnipotence. The Lord can act without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord Rāmacandra, however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of God’s uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord Rāmacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept Lord Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam  
evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma  
naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” The activities of the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed by any other living being. The symptoms of the Lord’s activities are all mentioned in the *śāstras,* and after one understands them one can accept the Lord as He is.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by throwing into the water the peaks of mountains whose trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord Rāmacandra went to Laṅkā to release Sītādevī from the clutches of Rāvaṇa. With the direction and help of Vibhīṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa’s brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers, headed by Sugrīva, Nīla and Hanumān, entered Rāvaṇa’s kingdom, Laṅkā, which had previously been burnt by Hanumān.**

### Purport

Great mountain peaks covered with trees and plants were thrown into the sea by the monkey soldiers and began to float by the supreme will of the Lord. By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets float weightlessly in space like swabs of cotton. If this is possible, why should great mountain peaks not be able to float on water? This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do anything and everything He likes, because He is not under the control of the material nature; indeed, material nature is controlled by Him. *Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram:* only under His direction does *prakṛti,* or material nature, work. Similar information is given in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.52):

*yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

Describing how material nature works, the *Brahma-saṁhitā* says that the sun moves as desired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, for Lord Rāmacandra to construct a bridge over the Indian Ocean with the help of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks into the water is not at all wonderful; it is wonderful only in the sense that it has kept the name and fame of Lord Rāmacandra eternally celebrated.

Thus the soldiers of Lord Rāmacandra killed Rāvaṇa’s soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Rāvaṇa had been condemned by the anger of mother Sītā.**

### Purport

The soldiers Lord Rāmacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and did not have proper equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Rāvaṇa, for Rāvaṇa’s soldiers were equipped with weapons of modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees. It was only Lord Rāmacandra and Lakṣmaṇa who shot some arrows. But because the soldiers of Rāvaṇa were condemned by the curse of mother Sītā, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by throwing stones and trees. There are two kinds of strength — *daiva* and *puruṣākāra.* *Daiva* refers to the strength achieved from the Transcendence, and *puruṣākāra* refers to the strength organized by one’s own intelligence and power. Transcendental power is always superior to the power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, one must fight one’s enemies even though one may not be equipped with modern weapons. Therefore Kṛṣṇa instructed Arjuna, *mām anusmara yudhya ca:* “Think of Me and fight.” We should fight our enemy to the best of our ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*rāmaḥ* — Lord Rāmacandra; *tam* — unto him, Rāvaṇa; *āha* — said; *puruṣa*-*ada*-*purīṣa* — you are the stool of the man-eaters (Rākṣasas); *yat* — because; *naḥ* — My; *kāntā* — wife; *asamakṣam* — helpless because of My absence; *asatā* — by you, the most sinful; *apahṛtā* — was kidnapped; *śva*-*vat* — like a dog who takes food from the kitchen in the absence of the proprietor; *te* — of you; *tyakta*-*trapasya* — because you are shameless; *phalam* *adya* — I shall give you the result today; *jugupsitasya* — of you, the most abominable; *yacchāmi* — I shall punish you; *kālaḥ* *iva* — like death; *kartuḥ* — of you, who are the performer of all sinful activities; *alaṅghya*-*vīryaḥ* — but I, being omnipotent, never fail in My attempt.

### Translation

**Lord Rāmacandra said to Rāvaṇa: You are the most abominable of the man-eaters. Indeed, you are like their stool. You resemble a dog, for as a dog steals eatables from the kitchen in the absence of the householder, in My absence you kidnapped My wife, Sītādevī. Therefore as Yamarāja punishes sinful men, I shall also punish you. You are most abominable, sinful and shameless. Today, therefore, I, whose attempt never fails, shall punish you.**

### Purport

*Na ca daivāt paraṁ balam:* no one can surpass the strength of the Transcendence. Rāvaṇa was so sinful and shameless that he did not know what the result would be of kidnapping mother Sītā, the pleasure potency of Rāmacandra. This is the disqualification of the Rākṣasas. *Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram.* The Rākṣasas are unaware that the Supreme Lord is the ruler of the creation. They think that everything has come about by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or controller. Therefore the Rākṣasas act independently, as they like, going even so far as to kidnap the goddess of fortune. This policy of Rāvaṇa’s is extremely dangerous for the materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the materialistic civilization. Nonetheless, because atheists are Rākṣasas, they dare to do things that are most abominable, and thus they are punished without fail. Religion consists of the orders of the Supreme Lord, and one who carries out these orders is religious. One who fails to carry out the Lord’s orders is irreligious, and he is to be punished.

### Translation

**After thus rebuking Rāvaṇa, Lord Rāmacandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at Rāvaṇa, and released the arrow, which pierced Rāvaṇa’s heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Rāvaṇa’s followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, “Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?” as Rāvaṇa, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.21) it is said, *kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti:* “When the results of their pious activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth.” The fruitive activities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can relieve one from *māyā’s* clutches of repeated birth and death. Somehow or other, Rāvaṇa was raised to an exalted position as the king of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of kidnapping mother Sītā, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If one offends an exalted personality, especially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable; bereft of the results of pious activities, one must fall down like Rāvaṇa and other demons. It is therefore advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the pure state of freedom from all designations (*sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam*). When one is fixed in devotional service, he is above the material platform. On the material platform there are higher and lower positions, but when one is above the material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (*sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate*). Rāvaṇa or those like him may be very powerful and opulent in this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of their *karma* (*karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa*). We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws of nature.

*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni  
guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ  
ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā  
kartāham iti manyate*

“The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.” (Bg. 3.27) One should not be proud of one’s exalted position and act like Rāvaṇa, thinking oneself independent of material nature’s laws.

### Purport

Rāvaṇa’s wife Mandodarī and the other wives knew very well how cruel a person Rāvaṇa was. The very word “Rāvaṇa” means “one who causes crying for others.” Rāvaṇa continuously caused trouble for others, but when his sinful activities culminated in giving trouble to Sītādevī, he was killed by Lord Rāmacandra.

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *vai* — indeed; *veda* — did know; *mahā*-*bhāga* — O greatly fortunate one; *bhavān* — yourself; *kāma*-*vaśam* — influenced by lusty desires; *gataḥ* — having become; *tejaḥ* — by influence; *anubhāvam* — as a result of such influence; *sītāyāḥ* — of mother Sītā; *yena* — by which; *nītaḥ* — brought into; *daśām* — condition; *imām* — like this (destruction).

### Translation

**O greatly fortunate one, you came under the influence of lusty desires, and therefore you could not understand the influence of mother Sītā. Now, because of her curse, you have been reduced to this state, having been killed by Lord Rāmacandra.**

### Purport

Not only was mother Sītā powerful, but any woman who follows in the footsteps of mother Sītā can also become similarly powerful. There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sītā is among them. Mandodarī, the wife of Rāvaṇa, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadī was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great personalities like Brahmā and Nārada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sītā, Mandodarī and Draupadī. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another’s wife. *Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:* an intelligent person must look upon another’s wife as being like his mother. This is a moral injunction from *Cāṇakya-śloka* (10).

*mātṛvat para-dāreṣu  
para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat  
ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu  
yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ*

“One who considers another’s wife as his mother, another’s possessions as a lump of dirt and treats all other living beings as he would himself, is considered to be learned.” Thus Rāvaṇa was condemned not only by Lord Rāmacandra but even by his own wife, Mandodarī. Because she was a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sītādevī.

### Translation

**O pleasure of the Rākṣasa dynasty, because of you the state of Laṅkā and also we ourselves now have no protector. By your deeds you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul fit to go to hell.**

### Purport

One who follows the path of Rāvaṇa is condemned in two ways: his body is fit to be eaten by dogs and vultures, and the soul goes to hell. As stated by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (16.19):

*tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān  
saṁsāreṣu narādhamān  
kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān  
āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu*

“Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.” Thus the destination of godless atheists such as Rāvaṇa, Hiraṇyakaśipu, Kaṁsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of life. Mandodarī, the wife of Rāvaṇa, could understand all this because she was a chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of her husband, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly with one’s material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (*paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ*). In Vedic history there are many instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature.

### Translation

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Vibhīṣaṇa, the pious brother of Rāvaṇa and devotee of Lord Rāmacandra, received approval from Lord Rāmacandra, the King of Kosala. Then he performed the prescribed funeral ceremonies for his family members to save them from the path to hell.**

### Purport

After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to another body, and thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or *śrāddha* ceremony, as prescribed in authorized *śāstra,* must be performed. Rāvaṇa was killed by Lord Rāmacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord Rāmacandra’s advice, Vibhīṣaṇa, Rāvaṇa’s brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord Rāmacandra was kind to Rāvaṇa even after Rāvaṇa’s death.

### Purport

People are very fond of the pattern of Rāma-rājya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party called Rāma-rājya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Rāma. It is sometimes said that people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord Rāmacandra and His citizens. Lord Rāmacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord Rāmacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children. As indicated here by the words *sva-dharma-niratā varṇāśrama-guṇān-vitāḥ,* the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of *varṇa* and *āśrama,* which arranges society in the *varṇa* divisions of *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra* and the *āśrama* divisions of *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* This is actual human civilization. People must be trained according to the different *varṇāśrama* occupational duties. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13), *cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:* the four *varṇas* must be established according to varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that it must institute this *varṇāśrama* system. The purpose of *varṇāśrama* is to enable people to become God conscious. *Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate*. The entire *varṇāśrama* scheme is intended to enable people to become Vaiṣṇavas. *Viṣṇur asya devatā.* When people worship Lord Viṣṇu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaiṣṇavas. Thus people should be trained to become Vaiṣṇavas through the system of *varṇa* and *āśrama,* as they were during the reign of Lord Rāmacandra, when everyone was fully trained to follow the *varṇāśrama* principles.

Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible. Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, brahmacārīs, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas* and *sannyāsīs.* This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (*varṇāśrama-guṇān-vitāḥ*). Generally speaking, if the king or president is a *rājarṣi,* the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the *varṇāśrama* system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Rāmacandra. If people follow this example, there will be good government all over the world.

### Translation

**Lord Rāmacandra became King during Tretā-yuga, but because of His good government, the age was like Satya-yuga. Everyone was religious and completely happy.**

### Purport

Among the four *yugas* — Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali — the Kali-yuga is the worst, but if the process of *varṇāśrama-dharma* is introduced, even in this Age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be invoked. The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is meant for this purpose.

*kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann  
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ  
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya  
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet*

“My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.” (*Bhāg.* 12.3.51) If people take to this *saṅkīrtana* movement of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma, they will certainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people of this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age. Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement; one need only chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* observe the rules and regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* with devotion and faith he will certainly be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. *Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam*. This is the blessing of Lord Rāmacandra, who has appeared in this Age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.

All these facilities existed because of Lord Rāmacandra’s presence as the king of the entire world. A similar situation could be introduced immediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is said, *kali-kāle nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra:* Kṛṣṇa descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy name — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma. If we chant offenselessly, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa are still present in this age. The kingdom of Rāma was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement can immediately introduce a similar situation, even in this Kali-yuga.

### Translation

**Lord Rāmacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no connection with any other women. He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He taught good behavior for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varṇāśrama-dharma. Thus He taught the general public by His personal activities.**

### Purport

*Eka-patnī-vrata,* accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by Lord Rāmacandra. One should not accept more than one wife. In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife. Even Lord Rāmacandra’s father accepted more wives than one. But Lord Rāmacandra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother Sītā. When mother Sītā was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa and the Rākṣasas, Lord Rāmacandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of Sītās, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with Rāvaṇa and finally killed him. The Lord punished Rāvaṇa and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife. Lord Rāmacandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders. A householder should live according to the ideal of Lord Rāmacandra, who showed how to be a perfect person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of *varṇāśrama-dharma.* Those who live in accordance with these principles, whether as householders, *brahmacārīs* or *vānaprasthas,* are all equally important.

### Purport

As Lord Rāmacandra is the ideal husband (*eka-patnī-vrata*), mother Sītā is the ideal wife. Such a combination makes family life very happy. *Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ:* whatever example a great man sets, common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the *brāhmaṇas,* the teachers, would set forth the examples we receive from Vedic literature, the entire world would be heaven; indeed, there would no longer be hellish conditions within this material world.
