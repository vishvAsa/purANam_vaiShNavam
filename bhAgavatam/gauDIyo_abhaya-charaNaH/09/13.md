CHAPTER THIRTEEN

This chapter describes the dynasty in which the great and learned scholar Janaka was born. This is the dynasty of Mahārāja Nimi, who is said to have been the son of Ikṣvāku.

When Mahārāja Nimi began performing great sacrifices, he appointed Vasiṣṭha to be chief priest, but Vasiṣṭha refused, for he had already agreed to be priest in performing a *yajña* for Lord Indra. Vasiṣṭha therefore requested Mahārāja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra’s sacrifice was finished, but Mahārāja Nimi did not wait. He thought, “Life is very short, so there is no need to wait.” He therefore appointed another priest to perform the *yajña.* Vasiṣṭha was very angry at King Nimi and cursed him, saying, “May your body fall down.” Cursed in that way, Mahārāja Nimi also became very angry and retaliated by saying, “May your body also fall down.” As a result of this cursing and countercursing, both of them died. After this incident, Vasiṣṭha took birth again, begotten by Mitra and Varuṇa, who were agitated by Urvaśī.

The priests who were engaged in the sacrifice for King Nimi preserved Nimi’s body in fragrant chemicals. When the sacrifice was over, the priests prayed for Nimi’s life to all the demigods who had come to the arena of *yajña,* but Mahārāja Nimi refused to take birth again in a material body because he considered the material body obnoxious. The great sages then churned Nimi’s body, and as a result of this churning, Janaka was born.

The son of Janaka was Udāvasu, and the son of Udāvasu was Nandivardhana. The son of Nandivardhana was Suketu, and his descendants continued as follows: Devarāta, Bṛhadratha, Mahāvīrya, Sudhṛti, Dhṛṣṭaketu, Haryaśva, Maru, Pratīpaka, Kṛtaratha, Devamīḍha, Viśruta, Mahādhṛti, Kṛtirāta, Mahāromā, Svarṇaromā, Hrasvaromā and Śīradhvaja. All these sons appeared in the dynasty one after another. From Śīradhvaja, mother Sītādevī was born. Śīradhvaja’s son was Kuśadhvaja, and the son of Kuśadhvaja was Dharmadhvaja. The sons of Dharmadhvaja were Kṛtadhvaja and Mitadhvaja. The son of Kṛtadhvaja was Keśidhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was Khāṇḍikya. Keśidhvaja was a self-realized soul, and his son was Bhānumān, whose descendants were as follows: Śatadyumna, Śuci, Sanadvāja, Ūrjaketu, Aja, Purujit, Ariṣṭanemi, Śrutāyu, Supārśvaka, Citraratha, Kṣemādhi, Samaratha, Satyaratha, Upaguru, Upagupta, Vasvananta, Yuyudha, Subhāṣaṇa, Śruta, Jaya, Vijaya, Ṛta, Śunaka, Vītahavya, Dhṛti, Bahulāśva, Kṛti and Mahāvaśī. All of these sons were great self-controlled personalities. This completes the list of the entire dynasty.

Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, *śarīraṁ kṣaṇa-vidhvāṁsi kalpānta-sthāyino guṇāḥ:* “The duration of one’s life in the material world may end at any moment, but if within this life one does something worthy, that qualification is depicted in history eternally.” Here is a great personality, Mahārāja Nimi, who knew this fact. In the human form of life one should perform activities in such a way that at the end he goes back home, back to Godhead. This is self-realization.

निमि- प्रतिददौ शापं गुरवेऽधर्मवर्तिने ।

### Verse text

*nimiḥ pratidadau śāpaṁ  
gurave ’dharma-vartine  
tavāpi patatād deho  
lobhād dharmam ajānataḥ*

### Synonyms

*nimiḥ* — Mahārāja Nimi; *pratidadau* *śāpam* — countercursed; *gurave* — unto his spiritual master, Vasiṣṭha; *adharma*-*vartine* — who was induced to irreligious principles (because he cursed his offenseless disciple); *tava* — of you; *api* — also; *patatāt* — let it fall; *dehaḥ* — the body; *lobhāt* — because of greed; *dharmam* — religious principles; *ajānataḥ* — not knowing.

### Translation

**For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no offense, Mahārāja Nimi countercursed his spiritual master. “For the sake of getting contributions from the King of heaven,” he said, “you have lost your religious intelligence. Therefore I pronounce this curse: your body also will fall.”**

### Purport

The religious principle for a *brāhmaṇa* is that he should not be greedy at all. In this case, however, for the sake of more lucrative remunerations from the King of heaven, Vasiṣṭha neglected Mahārāja Nimi’s request on this planet, and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests, Vasiṣṭha unnecessarily cursed him. When one is infected by contaminated activities, his power, material or spiritual, reduces. Although Vasiṣṭha was the spiritual master of Mahārāja Nimi, because of his greed he became fallen.

### Translation

**After saying this, Mahārāja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body. Vasiṣṭha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varuṇa when they saw Urvaśī, he was born again.**

### Purport

Mitra and Varuṇa chanced to meet Urvaśī, the most beautiful prostitute of the heavenly kingdom, and they became lusty. Because they were great saints, they tried to control their lust, but they could not do so, and thus they discharged semen. This semen was kept carefully in a waterpot, and Vasiṣṭha was born from it.

राज्ञो जीवतु देहोऽयं प्रसन्ना- प्रभवो यदि ।

### Verse text

*rājño jīvatu deho ’yaṁ  
prasannāḥ prabhavo yadi  
tathety ukte nimiḥ prāha  
mā bhūn me deha-bandhanam*

### Synonyms

*rājñaḥ* — of the King; *jīvatu* — may again be enlivened; *dehaḥ* *ayam* — this body (now preserved); *prasannāḥ* — very much pleased; *prabhavaḥ* — all able to do it; *yadi* — if; *tathā* — let it be so; *iti* — thus; *ukte* — when it was replied (by the demigods); *nimiḥ* — Mahārāja Nimi; *prāha* — said; *mā* *bhūt* — do not do it; *me* — my; *deha*-*bandhanam* — imprisonment again in a material body.

### Translation

**“If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so, kindly bring Mahārāja Nimi back to life in this body.” The demigods said yes to this request by the sages, but Mahārāja Nimi said, “Please do not imprison me again in a material body.”**

### Purport

The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human beings. Therefore, although the great saints and sages were also powerful *brāhmaṇas,* they requested the demigods to revive Mahārāja Nimi’s body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should not think that the demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life back to a dead body. There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example, according to the history of Sāvitrī and Satyavān, Satyavān died and was being taken away by Yamarāja, but on the request of his wife, Sāvitrī, Satyavān was revived in the same body. This is an important fact about the power of the demigods.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Nimi continued: Māyāvādīs generally want freedom from accepting a material body because they fear having to give it up again. But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a cause of bondage; because he was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he could render devotional service to the Lord. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings:

*janmāobi more icchā yadi tora  
bhakta-gṛhe jani janma ha-u mora  
kīṭa-janma ha-u yathā tuyā dāsa*

“My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again, kindly do me this favor: allow me to take birth in the home of Your servant, Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an insignificant creature like an insect.” Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said:

*na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ  
kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye  
mama janmani janmanīśvare  
bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi*

“O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to You.” (*Śikṣāṣṭaka* 4) By saying “life after life” (*janmani janmani*), the Lord referred not to an ordinary birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body is desirable. A devotee does not think like *yogīs* and *jñānīs,* who want to refuse a material body and become one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee does not like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body, material or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation.

If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material body, there is no cause of anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a liberated soul. This is confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:

*īhā yasya harer dāsye  
karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu  
jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

“A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Kṛṣṇa) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.” The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body. In a spiritual body the devotee becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee in Vaikuṇṭhaloka. There is no distinction. It is said, *sādhur jīvo vā maro vā.* Whether a devotee is alive or dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord. *Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.* When he gives up his body, he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same thing even in a material body in the material world.

For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One may argue that at the time of death a devotee also suffers because of giving up his material body. But in this connection the example may be given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth. Both the mouse and the kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten. When a devotee gives up his body (*tyaktvā deham*), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead. Thus his perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by Yamarāja for punishment. A person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a material body, whereas a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we should follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu: *mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi.* It doesn’t matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should be to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Verse text

*dehaṁ nāvarurutse ’haṁ  
duḥkha-śoka-bhayāvaham  
sarvatrāsya yato mṛtyur  
matsyānām udake yathā*

### Synonyms

*deham* — a material body; *na* — not; *avarurutse* — desire to accept; *aham* — I; *duḥkha*-*śoka*-*bhaya*-*āvaham* — which is the cause of all kinds of distress, lamentation and fear; *sarvatra* — always and everywhere within this universe; *asya* — of the living entities who have accepted material bodies; *yataḥ* — because; *mṛtyuḥ* — death; *matsyānām* — of the fish; *udake* — living within the water; *yathā* — like.

### Translation

**I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all distress, lamentation and fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in anxiety because of fear of death.**

### Purport

The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is destined to die. In the lower planetary system or lower species of life one may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one may live for a long, long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be understood. In the human form of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing *tapasya.* This is the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called *mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.* This can be done only when one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, or has achieved the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material body subject to birth, death, old age and disease.

The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the fish is never free from anxiety about death, since big fish are always eager to eat the small fish. *Phalgūni tatra mahatām:* all living entities are eaten by bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature.

*ahastāni sahastānām  
apadāni catuṣ-padām  
phalgūni tatra mahatāṁ  
jīvo jīvasya jīvanam*

“Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another.” (*Bhāg.* 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material world in such a way that one living entity is food for another. Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although we speak of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord. *Hariṁ vinā naiva sṛtiṁ taranti:* one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming a devotee. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.3). *Aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.* One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa must certainly wander up and down within the cycle of birth and death.

### Translation

**The demigods said: Let Mahārāja Nimi live without a material body. Let him live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, according to his desire, let him be manifest or unmanifest to common materially embodied people.**

### Purport

The demigods wanted Mahārāja Nimi to come to life, but Mahārāja Nimi did not want to accept another material body. Under the circumstances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body. There are two kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by common men. The term “spiritual body” is sometimes taken to refer to a ghostly body. An impious man who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he cannot possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego. However, as explained in *Bhagavad-gītā,* devotees can give up the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all material tinges, gross and subtle (*tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle material contamination.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being *jīvan-mukta,* can be seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ:* the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is not manifest to everyone and anyone. To the common man He is unseen. *Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:* Kṛṣṇa and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia cannot be materially understood. Unless one is advanced in spiritual life (*sevonmukhe hi jihvādau*), one cannot see Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the ability to see Kṛṣṇa depends on Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. The same privilege of being seen or unseen according to one’s own desire was given to Mahārāja Nimi. Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Verse text

*arājaka-bhayaṁ nṝṇāṁ

### Synonyms

*arājaka*-*bhayam* — due to fear of the danger of an unregulated government; *nṝṇām* — for the people in general; *manyamānāḥ* — considering this situation; *mahā*-*ṛṣayaḥ* — the great sages; *deham* — the body; *mamanthuḥ* — churned; *sma* — in the past; *nimeḥ* — of Mahārāja Nimi; *kumāraḥ* — one son; *samajāyata* — was thus born.

### Translation

**Thereafter, to save the people from the danger of an unregulated government, the sages churned Mahārāja Nimi’s material body, from which, as a result, a son was born.**

### Purport

*Arājaka-bhayam.* If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is danger of fear for the people. At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see that the great sages got a son from Nimi’s material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance is the duty of a *kṣatriya* king. A *kṣatriya* is one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called people’s government there is no trained *kṣatriya* king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned *brāhmaṇas* expert in the *śāstras.* Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are happy. The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord Rāmacandra, the government of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and the governments of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Mahārāja Ambarīṣa and Mahārāja Prahlāda. There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King Parīkṣit, all the kings of the dynasty of Mithila were completely in knowledge of their spiritual identity. Therefore, even though staying at home, they were liberated from the duality of material existence.**

### Purport

This material world is called *dvaita,* or duality. The *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya* 4.176) says:

*‘dvaite’ bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba — ‘manodharma’  
‘ei bhāla, ei manda,’ — ei saba ‘bhrama’*

In the world of duality — that is to say, in the material world — so-called goodness and badness are both the same. Therefore, in this world, to distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is meaningless because they are both mental concoctions (*manodharma*). Because everything here is miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply illusion. The liberated person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature, is unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances. He remains Kṛṣṇa conscious by tolerating so-called happiness and distress. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.14):

*mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya  
śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkhadāḥ  
āgamāpāyino ’nityās  
tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata*

“O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.” Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not care about so-called happiness and distress. They know that these are like changing seasons, which are perceivable by contact with the material body. Happiness and distress come and go. Therefore a *paṇḍita,* a learned man, is not concerned with them. As it is said, *gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.* The body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and distress. Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila were all liberated persons, unaffected by the so-called happiness and distress of this world.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Dynasty of Mahārāja Nimi.”*
