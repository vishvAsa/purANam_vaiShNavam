CHAPTER ONE

This chapter describes how Sudyumna became a woman and how the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu was amalgamated with the Soma-vaṁśa, the dynasty coming from the moon.

By the desire of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Śukadeva Gosvāmī told about the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu, who was formerly King Satyavrata, the ruler of Draviḍa. While describing this dynasty, he also described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, while lying down in the waters of devastation, gave birth to Lord Brahmā from a lotus generated from His navel. From the mind of Lord Brahmā, Marīci was generated, and his son was Kaśyapa. From Kaśyapa, through Aditi, Vivasvān was generated, and from Vivasvān came Śrāddhadeva Manu, who was born from the womb of Saṁjñā. Śrāddhadeva’s wife, Śraddhā, gave birth to ten sons, such as Ikṣvāku and Nṛga.

Śrāddhadeva, or Vaivasvata Manu, the father of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku, was sonless before Ikṣvāku’s birth, but by the grace of the great sage Vasiṣṭha he performed a *yajña* to satisfy Mitra and Varuṇa. Then, although Vaivasvata Manu wanted a son, by the desire of his wife he got a daughter named Ilā. Manu, however, was not satisfied with the daughter. Consequently, for Manu’s satisfaction, the great sage Vasiṣṭha prayed for Ilā to be transformed into a boy, and his prayer was fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Ilā became a beautiful young man named Sudyumna.

Once upon a time, Sudyumna went on tour with his ministers. At the foot of the mountain Sumeru there is a forest named Sukumāra, and as soon as they entered that forest, they were all transformed into women. When Mahārāja Parīkṣit inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī about the reason for this transformation, Śukadeva Gosvāmī described how Sudyumna, being transformed into a woman, accepted Budha, the son of the moon, as her husband and had a son named Purūravā. By the grace of Lord Śiva, Sudyumna received the benediction that he would live one month as a woman and one month as a man. Thus he regained his kingdom and had three sons, named Utkala, Gaya and Vimala, who were all very religious. Thereafter, he entrusted his kingdom to Purūravā and took the order of *vānaprastha* life.

Because Manu had no issue, he was pleased at the birth of the child, even though a daughter, and gave her the name Ilā. Later, however, he was not very satisfied to see the daughter instead of a son. Because he had no issue, he was certainly very glad at the birth of Ilā, but his pleasure was temporary.

### Translation

**My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras. How then has the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation. There should not have been such a reversal of the results of the Vedic mantras.**

### Purport

In this age, the performance of *yajña* has been forbidden because no one can properly chant the Vedic *mantras.* If Vedic *mantras* are chanted properly, the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be successful. Therefore the Hare Kṛṣṇa chant is called the *mahā-mantra,* the great, exalted *mantra* above all other Vedic *mantras,* because simply chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* brings so many beneficial effects. As explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu (*Śikṣāṣṭaka* 1):

*ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ  
śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam  
ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ  
sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam*

“Glory to the Śrī Kṛṣṇa *saṅkīrtana,* which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death. This *saṅkīrtana* movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious.”

Therefore, the best performance of *yajña* given to us is the *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 11.5.32). Those who are intelligent take advantage of the greatest *yajña* in this age by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* in congregation. When the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is chanted by many men together, the chanting is called *saṅkīrtana,* and as a result of such a *yajña* there will be clouds in the sky (*yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ*). In these days of drought, people can gain relief from scarcity of rain and food by the simple method of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *yajña.* Indeed, this can relieve all of human society. At present there are droughts throughout Europe and America, and people are suffering, but if people take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful activities and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* all their problems will be solved without difficulty. In other processes of *yajña* there are difficulties because there are no learned scholars who can chant the *mantras* perfectly well, nor is it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the *yajña.* Because human society is poverty-stricken and men are devoid of Vedic knowledge and the power to chant the Vedic *mantras,* the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is the only shelter. People should be intelligent enough to chant it. *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.* Those whose brains are dull cannot understand this chanting, nor can they take to it.

### Synonyms

*yūyam* — of all you; *brahma*-*vidaḥ* — completely in awareness of the Absolute Truth; *yuktāḥ* — self-controlled and well balanced; *tapasā* — by dint of austerity and penances; *dagdha*-*kilbiṣāḥ* — all kinds of material contamination having been burnt out; *kutaḥ* — then how; *saṅkalpa*-*vaiṣamyam* — discrepancy in the matter of determination; *anṛtam* — false promise, false statement; *vibudheṣu* — in the society of the demigods; *iva* — or.

### Translation

**You are all self-controlled, well balanced in mind, and aware of the Absolute Truth. And because of austerities and penances you are completely cleansed of all material contamination. Your words, like those of the demigods, are never baffled. Then how is it possible that your determination has failed?**

### Purport

We have learned from many Vedic literatures that a benediction or curse given by the demigods never proves false. By performing austerities and penances, by controlling the senses and mind, and by achieving full knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one is fully cleansed of material contamination. Then one’s words and blessings, like those of the demigods, are never a failure.

### Translation

**Since that time, no male had entered that forest. But now King Sudyumna, having been transformed into a female, began to walk with his associates from one forest to another.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.22) it is said:

*vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya  
navāni gṛhṇāti naro ’parāṇi  
tathā sarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇāny  
anyāni saṁyāti navāni dehī*

“As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.”

The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved. Sudyumna and his associates were all male, which means that their souls were covered by male dress, but now they became female, which means that their dress was changed. The soul, however, remains the same. It is said that by modern medical treatment a male can be transformed into a female, and a female into a male. The body, however, has no connection with the soul. The body can be changed, either in this life or the next. Therefore, one who has knowledge of the soul and how the soul transmigrates from one body to another does not pay attention to the body, which is nothing but a covering dress. *Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*. Such a person sees the soul, which is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he is a *sama-darśī,* a learned person.

### Translation

**O King Parīkṣit, Lord Śiva was pleased with Vasiṣṭha. Therefore, to satisfy him and to keep his own word to Pārvatī, Lord Śiva said to that saintly person, “Your disciple Sudyumna may remain a male for one month and a female for the next. In this way he may rule the world as he likes.”**

### Purport

The word *gotrajaḥ* is significant in this connection. *Brāhmaṇas* generally act as spiritual masters of two dynasties. One is their disciplic succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen. Both descendants belong to the same *gotra,* or dynasty. In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both *brāhmaṇas* and *kṣatriyas* and even *vaiśyas* come in the disciplic succession of the same *ṛṣis.* Because the *gotra* and dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the family born of the semen. The same system still prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the *gotra* is calculated. Here the word *gotrajaḥ* refers to those born in the same dynasty, whether they be disciples or members of the family.
