CHAPTER TWENTY

This chapter describes the history of Pūru and his descendant Duṣmanta. The son of Pūru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvān. The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvān, one after another, were Pravīra, Manusyu, Cārupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Saṁyāti, Ahaṁyāti and Raudrāśva. Raudrāśva had ten sons — Ṛteyu, Kakṣeyu, Sthaṇḍileyu, Kṛteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu. The son of Ṛteyu was Rantināva, who had three sons — Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha was Kaṇva, and Kaṇva’s son was Medhātithi. The sons of Medhātithi, headed by Praskanna, were all *brāhmaṇas.* The son of Rantināva named Sumati had a son named Rebhi, and his son was Duṣmanta.

While hunting in the forest, Duṣmanta once approached the *āśrama* of Mahāṛṣi Kaṇva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her. That woman was the daughter of Viśvāmitra, and her name was Śakuntalā. Her mother was Menakā, who had left her in the forest, where Kaṇva Muni found her. Kaṇva Muni brought her to his *āśrama,* where he raised and maintained her. When Śakuntalā accepted Mahārāja Duṣmanta as her husband, he married her according to the *gāndharva-vidhi.* Śakuntalā later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the *āśrama* of Kaṇva Muni and returned to his kingdom.

In due course of time, Śakuntalā gave birth to a Vaiṣṇava son, but Duṣmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place. Therefore, when Śakuntalā approached him with her newly born child, Mahārāja Duṣmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later, however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them. After Mahārāja Duṣmanta’s death, Bharata, the son of Śakuntalā, was enthroned. He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the *brāhmaṇas.* This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvāja and how Mahārāja Bharata accepted Bharadvāja as his son.

श्रीबादरायणिरुवाच  
पूरोर्वंशं प्रवक्ष्यामि यत्र जातोऽसि भारत ।  
यत्र राजर्षयो वंश्या ब्रह्मवंश्याश्च जज्ञिरे ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-bādarāyaṇir uvāca  
*pūror vaṁśaṁ pravakṣyāmi  
yatra jāto ’si bhārata  
yatra rājarṣayo vaṁśyā  
brahma-vaṁśyāś ca jajñire*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bādarāyaṇiḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *pūroḥ* *vaṁśam* — the dynasty of Mahārāja Pūru; *pravakṣyāmi* — now I shall narrate; *yatra* — in which dynasty; *jātaḥ* *asi* — you were born; *bhārata* — O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, descendant of Mahārāja Bharata; *yatra* — in which dynasty; *rāja*-*ṛṣayaḥ* — all the kings were saintly; *vaṁśyāḥ* — one after another; *brahma*-*vaṁśyāḥ* — many *brāhmaṇa* dynasties; *ca* — also; *jajñire* — grew up.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, descendant of Mahārāja Bharata, I shall now describe the dynasty of Pūru, in which you were born, in which many saintly kings appeared, and from which many dynasties of brāhmaṇas began.**

### Purport

There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from *kṣatriyas* many *brāhmaṇas* have been born and that from *brāhmaṇas* many *kṣatriyas* have been born. The Lord Himself says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13), *cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:* “According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.” Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly. *Yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.* One’s place in the *varṇa* divisions of society is determined according to one’s symptoms or qualities. This is maintained everywhere in the *śāstra.* Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one’s qualities and activities.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*duṣmantaḥ* *uvāca* — King Duṣmanta replied; *upapannam* — just befitting your position; *idam* — this; *su*-*bhru* — O Śakuntalā, with beautiful eyebrows; *jātāyāḥ* — because of your birth; *kuśika*-*anvaye* — in the family of Viśvāmitra; *svayam* — personally; *hi* — indeed; *vṛṇute* — select; *rājñām* — of a royal family; *kanyakāḥ* — daughters; *sadṛśam* — on an equal level; *varam* — husbands.

### Translation

**King Duṣmanta replied: O Śakuntalā, with beautiful eyebrows, you have taken your birth in the family of the great saint Viśvāmitra, and your reception is quite worthy of your family. Aside from this, the daughters of a king generally select their own husbands.**

### Purport

In her reception of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, Śakuntalā clearly said, “Your Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer.” Thus she indicated that she wanted Mahārāja Duṣmanta as her husband. As far as Mahārāja Duṣmanta was concerned, he desired Śakuntalā as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural. To induce Śakuntalā to accept the marriage, Mahārāja Duṣmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assembly. In the history of Āryan civilization there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions. For example, it was in such a competition that Sītādevī accepted Lord Rāmacandra as her husband and that Draupadī accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage by agreement or by selecting one’s own husband in an open competition is allowed. There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is called *gāndharva* marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their daughter or son, but *gāndharva* marriage takes place by personal selection. Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement. Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal *kṣatriya* families. Mahārāja Duṣmanta’s acceptance of Śakuntalā as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture. How the marriage took place is described in the next verse.

### Verse text

*om ity ukte yathā-dharmam  
upayeme śakuntalām  
gāndharva-vidhinā rājā  
deśa-kāla-vidhānavit*

### Synonyms

*om* *iti* *ukte* — by reciting the Vedic *praṇava,* invoking the Supreme Personality of Godhead to witness the marriage; *yathā*-*dharmam* — exactly according to the principles of religion (because Nārāyaṇa becomes the witness in an ordinary religious marriage also); *upayeme* — he married; *śakuntalām* — the girl Śakuntalā; *gāndharva*-*vidhinā* — by the regulative principle of the Gandharvas, without deviation from religious principles; *rājā* — Mahārāja Duṣmanta; *deśa*-*kāla*-*vidhāna*-*vit* — completely aware of duties according to time, position and objective.

### Translation

**When Śakuntalā responded to Mahārāja Duṣmanta’s proposal with silence, the agreement was complete. Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic praṇava \[oṁkāra\], in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.**

### Purport

The *oṁkāra, praṇava,* is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters. *Bhagavad-gītā* says that the letters *a-u-m,* combined together as *om,* represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who says in *Bhagavad-gītā* that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles. The word *vidhinā* means, “according to religious principles.” The association of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.

### Purport

Mahārāja Duṣmanta knew that Śakuntalā and the boy were his own wife and son, but because they came from outside and were unknown to the citizens, he at first declined to accept them. Śakuntalā, however, was so chaste that an omen from the sky declared the truth so that others could hear. When everyone heard from the omen that Śakuntalā and her child were truly the King’s wife and son, the King gladly accepted them.

### Verse text

*mātā bhastrā pituḥ putro  
yena jātaḥ sa eva saḥ  
bharasva putraṁ duṣmanta  
māvamaṁsthāḥ śakuntalām*

### Synonyms

*mātā* — the mother; *bhastrā* — just like the skin of a bellows containing air; *pituḥ* — of the father; *putraḥ* — the son; *yena* — by whom; *jātaḥ* — one is born; *saḥ* — the father; *eva* — indeed; *saḥ* — the son; *bharasva* — just maintain; *putram* — your son; *duṣmanta* — O Mahārāja Duṣmanta; *mā* — do not; *avamaṁsthāḥ* — insult; *śakuntalām* — Śakuntalā.

### Translation

**The voice said: O Mahārāja Duṣmanta, a son actually belongs to his father, whereas the mother is only a container, like the skin of a bellows. According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son. Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult Śakuntalā.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic injunction *ātmā vai putra-nāmāsi,* the father becomes the son. The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for maintaining the son. In *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all living entities (*ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā*), and therefore He is responsible for maintaining them. This is also confirmed in the *Vedas.* *Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān:* although God is one, He maintains all living entities with their necessities for life. The living entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different bodies. The small ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat. Therefore there is no question of overpopulation. Because the father, Kṛṣṇa, is fully opulent, there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth. Actually one suffers for want of food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to supply him food. It is the living entity’s position that determines whether food will be supplied or not. When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied with food. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.10) the Lord also says, *bījaṁ māṁ sarva-bhūtānām:* “I am the seed of all living entities.” A particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out. The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth.

### Verse text

*reto-dhāḥ putro nayati  
naradeva yama-kṣayāt  
tvaṁ cāsya dhātā garbhasya

### Synonyms

*retaḥ*-*dhāḥ* — a person who discharges semen; *putraḥ* — the son; *nayati* — saves; *nara*-*deva* — O King (Mahārāja Duṣmanta); *yama*-*kṣayāt* — from punishment by Yamarāja, or from the custody of Yamarāja; *tvam* — your good self; *ca* — and; *asya* — of this child; *dhātā* — the creator; *garbhasya* — of the embryo; *satyam* — truthfully; *āha* — said; *śakuntalā* — your wife, Śakuntalā.

### Translation

**O King Duṣmanta, he who discharges semen is the actual father, and his son saves him from the custody of Yamarāja. You are the actual procreator of this child. Indeed, Śakuntalā is speaking the truth.**

### Purport

Upon hearing the omen, Mahārāja Duṣmanta accepted his wife and child. According to Vedic *smṛti:*

*pun-nāmno narakād yasmāt  
pitaraṁ trāyate sutaḥ  
tasmāt putra iti proktaḥ  
svayam eva svayambhuvā*

Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called *put,* the son is called *putra.* According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered. Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature. A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition. This verse clearly says, *putro nayati naradeva yama-kṣayāt:* “The son saves his father from the custody of Yamarāja.” It never says, *putro nayati mātaram:* “The son saves his mother.” The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother. Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaiṣṇava, he can save both the father and mother from the custody of Yamarāja and punishment in hellish life.

Anyone extraordinarily powerful must be considered a partial representation of the opulence of the Supreme Godhead. Therefore when the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta became the emperor of the entire world, he was celebrated in this way.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Bharata, the son of Duṣmanta, had the mark of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s disc on the palm of his right hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world. Then, under the priesthood of Māmateya, Bhṛgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse sacrifices on the bank of the Yamunā, beginning from the confluence at Prayāga and ending at the source. He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brāhmaṇas. Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brāhmaṇas had one badva \[13,084\] as his share.**

### Purport

As indicated here by the words *dauṣmanter agniḥ sācī-guṇe citaḥ,* Bharata, the son of Mahārāja Duṣmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the banks of the Ganges and Yamunā, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed in very distinguished places. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.9), *yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ:* “Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed; otherwise work binds one to this material world.” Everyone should engage in the performance of *yajña,* and the sacrificial fire should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in spiritual life. Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified *brāhmaṇas* who could perform such *yajñas.* For the present, however, the *Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa* enjoins:

*aśvamedhaṁ gavālambhaṁ  
sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam  
devareṇa sutotpattiṁ  
kalau pañca vivarjayet*

“In this Age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of *sannyāsa,* offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of one’s brother.” In this age, such *yajñas* as the *aśvamedha-yajña* and *gomedha-yajña* are impossible to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified *brāhmaṇas.* This verse says, *māmateyaṁ purodhāya:* Mahārāja Bharata engaged the son of Mamatā, Bhṛgu Muni, to take charge of performing this *yajña.* Now, however, such *brāhmaṇas* are impossible to find. Therefore the *śāstras* recommend, *yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:* those who are intelligent should perform the *saṅkīrtana-yajña* inaugurated by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

*kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ  
saṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam  
yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair  
yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ*

“In this Age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of *saṅkīrtana-yajña.*” (*Bhāg.* 11.5.32) *Yajña* must be performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa all over the world. This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is also *yajña,* but without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified *brāhmaṇas.* This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, all the purposes of *yajña* will be fulfilled. The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be any produce (*annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ*). All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (*kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ*), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (*sarva-kāma-dughā mahī*). In conclusion, therefore, in this Age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life — illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling — and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple *yajña* of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order.

This can happen even in the society of the higher demigods, so what to speak of human society? The sex impulse is so strong that it can agitate even a learned personality like Bṛhaspati.

### Translation

**Mamatā very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered giving up the child. But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a name for the child.**

### Purport

According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as *jāta-karma* and *nāma-karaṇa,* in which learned *brāhmaṇas,* immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamatā gave birth was begotten by Bṛhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamatā was the wife of Utathya, Bṛhaspati made her pregnant by force. Therefore Bṛhaspati became *bhartā.* According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called *dvāja.* The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is *doglā,* which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamatā, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvāja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamatā and Bṛhaspati.

Thus the child was known as Bharadvāja.**
