CHAPTER NINE

This chapter describes the history of the dynasty of Aṁśumān, up to Khaṭvāṅga, and it also describes how Bhagīratha brought the water of the Ganges to this earth.

The son of Mahārāja Aṁśumān was Dilīpa, who tried to bring the Ganges to this world but who died without success. Bhagīratha, the son of Dilīpa, was determined to bring the Ganges to the material world, and for this purpose he underwent severe austerities. Mother Ganges, being fully satisfied by his austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give him a benediction. Bhagīratha then asked her to deliver his forefathers. Although mother Ganges agreed to come down to earth, she made two conditions: first, she wanted some suitable male to be able to control her waves; second, although all sinful men would be freed from sinful reactions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges did not want to keep all these sinful reactions. These two conditions were subject matters for consideration. Bhagīratha replied to mother Ganges, “The Personality of Godhead Lord Śiva will be completely able to control the waves of your water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions left by sinful men will be counteracted.” Bhagīratha then performed austerities to satisfy Lord Śiva, who is called Āśutoṣa because he is naturally satisfied very easily. Lord Śiva agreed to Bhagīratha’s proposal to check the force of the Ganges. In this way, simply by the touch of the Ganges, Bhagīratha’s forefathers were delivered and allowed to go to the heavenly planets.

The son of Bhagīratha was Śruta, the son of Śruta was Nābha, and Nābha’s son was Sindhudvīpa. The son of Sindhudvīpa was Ayutāyu, and the son of Ayutāyu was Ṛtūparṇa, who was a friend of Nala. Ṛtūparṇa gave Nala the art of gambling and learned from him the art of *aśva-vidyā.* The son of Ṛtūparṇa was known as Sarvakāma, the son of Sarvakāma was Sudāsa, and his son was Saudāsa. The wife of Saudāsa was named Damayantī or Madayantī, and Saudāsa was also known as Kalmāṣapāda. Because of some defect in his fruitive activities, Saudāsa was cursed by Vasiṣṭha to become a Rākṣasa. While walking through the forest, he saw a *brāhmaṇa* engaged in sex with his wife, and because he had become a Rākṣasa he wanted to devour the *brāhmaṇa.* Although the *brāhmaṇa’s* wife pleaded with him in many ways, Saudāsa devoured the *brāhmaṇa,* and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, “As soon as you engage in sex you will die.” After twelve years, therefore, even though Saudāsa was released from the curse of Vasiṣṭha Muni, he remained sonless. At that time, with Saudāsa’s permission, Vasiṣṭha impregnated Saudāsa’s wife, Madayantī. Because Madayantī bore the child for many years but still could not give birth, Vasiṣṭha struck her abdomen with a stone, and thus a son was born. The son was named Aśmaka.

The son of Aśmaka was known as Bālika. He was protected from the curse of Paraśurāma because of being surrounded by many women, and therefore he is also known as Nārīkavaca. When the entire world was devoid of *kṣatriyas,* he became the original father of more *kṣatriyas.* He is therefore sometimes called Mūlaka. From Bālika, Daśaratha was born, from Daśaratha came Aiḍaviḍi, and from Aiḍaviḍi came Viśvasaha. The son of Viśvasaha was Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga. Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga joined the demigods in fighting the demons and was victorious, and the demigods therefore wanted to give him a benediction. But when the King inquired how long he would live and understood that his life would last only a few seconds more, he immediately left the heavenly planets and returned to his own abode by airplane. He could understand that everything in this material world is insignificant, and thus he fully engaged in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.

### Purport

The King’s desire was to deliver his forefathers, who had been burnt to ashes because of disrespecting Kapila Muni.

किं चाहं न भुवं यास्ये नरा मय्यामृजन्त्यघम् ।

### Verse text

*kiṁ cāhaṁ na bhuvaṁ yāsye  
narā mayy āmṛjanty agham  
mṛjāmi tad aghaṁ kvāhaṁ  
rājaṁs tatra vicintyatām*

### Synonyms

*kim* *ca* — also; *aham* — I; *na* — not; *bhuvam* — to the planet earth; *yāsye* — shall go; *narāḥ* — the people in general; *mayi* — in me, in my water; *āmṛjanti* — cleanse; *agham* — the reactions of their sinful activity; *mṛjāmi* — I shall wash; *tat* — that; *agham* — accumulation of sinful reactions; *kva* — unto whom; *aham* — I; *rājan* — O King; *tatra* — on this fact; *vicintyatām* — please consider carefully and decide.

### Translation

**O King, I do not wish to go down to the planet earth, for there the people in general will bathe in my water to cleanse themselves of the reactions of their sinful deeds. When all these sinful reactions accumulate in me, how shall I become free from them? You must consider this very carefully.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead says:

*sarva-dharmān parityajya  
mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo  
mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66) The Supreme Personality of Godhead can accept the reactions of anyone’s sinful deeds and neutralize them because He is *pavitra,* pure, like the sun, which is never contaminated by any worldly infection. *Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya vahneḥ sarva-bhujo yathā* (*Bhāg.* 10.33.29). One who is very powerful is not affected by any sinful activity. But here we see that mother Ganges fears being burdened with the sins of the people in general who would bathe in her waters. This indicates that no one but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of sinful deeds, whether one’s own or those of others. Sometimes the spiritual master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that disciple’s past sinful activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer — if not fully, then partially — for the sinful acts of the disciple. Every disciple, therefore, must be very careful not to commit sinful activities after initiation. The poor spiritual master is kind and merciful enough to accept a disciple and partially suffer for that disciple’s sinful activities, but Kṛṣṇa, being merciful to His servant, neutralizes the reactions of sinful deeds for the servant who engages in preaching His glories. Even mother Ganges feared the sinful reactions of the people in general and was anxious about how she would counteract the burden of these sins.

### Verse text

śrī-bhagīratha uvāca  
*sādhavo nyāsinaḥ śāntā  
brahmiṣṭhā loka-pāvanāḥ  
haranty aghaṁ te ’ṅga-saṅgāt  
teṣv āste hy agha-bhid dhariḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagīrathaḥ* *uvāca* — Bhagīratha said; *sādhavaḥ* — saintly persons; *nyāsinaḥ* — *sannyāsīs*; *śāntāḥ* — peaceful, free from material disturbances; *brahmiṣṭhāḥ* — expert in following the regulative principles of Vedic scripture; *loka*-*pāvanāḥ* — who are engaged in delivering the entire world from a fallen condition; *haranti* — shall remove; *agham* — the reactions of sinful life; *te* — of you (mother Ganges); *aṅga*-*saṅgāt* — by bathing in the Ganges water; *teṣu* — within themselves; *āste* — there is; *hi* — indeed; *agha*-*bhit* — the Supreme Personality, who can vanquish all sinful activities; *hariḥ* — the Lord.

### Translation

**Bhagīratha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional service and are therefore in the renounced order, free from material desires, and who are pure devotees, expert in following the regulative principles mentioned in the Vedas, are always glorious and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls. When such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions accumulated from other people will certainly be counteracted, for such devotees always keep in the core of their hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can vanquish all sinful reactions.**

### Purport

Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing. Therefore, not only will sinful persons bathe in the Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the renounced order can deliver even the Ganges. *Tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni svāntaḥ-sthena gadābhṛtā* (*Bhāg.* 1.13.10). Because saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy places of all sinful reactions. Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly persons. It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaiṣṇava, or even a *sannyāsī,* one should immediately offer respects to such a holy man. If one forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is a Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee or saintly person.

There are methods of *prāyaścitta,* or atonement, but they are inadequate to cleanse one of sinful reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the history of Ajāmila:

*kecit kevalayā bhaktyā  
vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ  
aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena  
nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ*

“Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.” (*Bhāg.* 6.1.15) If one is under the protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process of *bhakti-yoga* one is certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions.

धारयिष्यति ते वेगं रुद्रस्त्वात्मा शरीरिणाम् ।  
यस्मिन्नोतमिदं प्रोतं विश्वं शाटीव तन्तुषु ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*dhārayiṣyati te vegaṁ  
rudras tv ātmā śarīriṇām  
yasminn otam idaṁ protaṁ  
viśvaṁ śāṭīva tantuṣu*

### Synonyms

*dhārayiṣyati* — will sustain; *te* — your; *vegam* — force of the waves; *rudraḥ* — Lord Śiva; *tu* — indeed; *ātmā* — the Supersoul; *śarīriṇām* — of all embodied souls; *yasmin* — in whom; *otam* — is situated in its longitude; *idam* — this whole universe; *protam* — latitude; *viśvam* — the whole universe; *śāṭī* — a cloth; *iva* — as; *tantuṣu* — in threads.

### Translation

**Like a cloth woven of threads extending for its length and breadth, this entire universe, in all its latitude and longitude, is situated under different potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Śiva is the incarnation of the Lord, and thus he represents the Supersoul in the embodied soul. He can sustain your forceful waves on his head.**

### Purport

The water of the Ganges is supposed to rest on the head of Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sustains the entire universe by different potencies. Lord Śiva is described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.45):

*kṣīraṁ yathā dadhi vikāra-viśeṣa-yogāt  
sañjāyate na hi tataḥ pṛthag asti hetoḥ  
yaḥ śambhutām api tathā samupaiti kāryād  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“Milk changes into yogurt when mixed with a yogurt culture, but actually yogurt is constitutionally nothing but milk. Similarly, Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Śiva for the special purpose of material transactions. I offer my obeisances at Lord Govinda’s lotus feet.” Lord Śiva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same sense that yogurt is also milk although at the same time it is not milk. For the maintenance of the material world there are three incarnations — Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (Lord Śiva). Lord Śiva is Viṣṇu in an incarnation for the mode of ignorance. The material world exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance. Therefore Lord Śiva is compared here to the longitude and latitude of the entire universe, which resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for both its length and breadth.

इत्युक्त्वा स नृपो देवं तपसातोषयच्छिवम् ।  
कालेनाल्पीयसा राजंस्तस्येशश्चाश्वतुष्यत ॥ ८ ॥

### Verse text

*ity uktvā sa nṛpo devaṁ  
tapasātoṣayac chivam  
kālenālpīyasā rājaṁs  
tasyeśaś cāśv atuṣyata*

### Synonyms

*iti* *uktvā* — after saying this; *saḥ* — he; *nṛpaḥ* — the King (Bhagīratha); *devam* — unto Lord Śiva; *tapasā* — by executing austerities; *atoṣayat* — pleased; *śivam* — Lord Śiva, the all-auspicious; *kālena* — by time; *alpīyasā* — which was not very long; *rājan* — O King; *tasya* — upon him (Bhagīratha); *īśaḥ* — Lord Śiva; *ca* — indeed; *āśu* — very soon; *atuṣyata* — became satisfied.

### Translation

**After saying this, Bhagīratha satisfied Lord Śiva by performing austerities. O King Parīkṣit, Lord Śiva was very quickly satisfied with Bhagīratha.**

### Purport

The words *āśv atuṣyata* indicate that Lord Śiva was satisfied very soon. Therefore another name for Lord Śiva is Āśutoṣa. Materialistic persons become attached to Lord Śiva because Lord Śiva bestows benedictions upon anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his devotees prosper or suffer. Although materialistic persons know that material happiness is nothing but another side of suffering, they want it, and to get it very quickly they worship Lord Śiva. We find that materialists are generally devotees of many demigods, especially Lord Śiva and mother Durgā. They do not actually want spiritual happiness, for it is almost unknown to them. But if one is serious about being happy spiritually, he must take shelter of Lord Viṣṇu, as the Lord personally demands:

*sarva-dharmān parityajya  
mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo  
mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” (Bg. 18.66)

### Translation

**When King Bhagīratha approached Lord Śiva and requested him to sustain the forceful waves of the Ganges, Lord Śiva accepted the proposal by saying, “Let it be so.” Then, with great attention, he sustained the Ganges on his head, for the water of the Ganges is purifying, having emanated from the toes of Lord Viṣṇu.**

### Translation

**Because the sons of Sagara Mahārāja had offended a great personality, the heat of their bodies had increased, and they were burnt to ashes. But simply by being sprinkled with water from the Ganges, all of them became eligible to go to the heavenly planets. What then is to be said of those who use the water of mother Ganges to worship her?**

### Purport

Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee takes a little water from the Ganges and offers it back to the Ganges. When the devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose anything, and when the water is offered back, mother Ganges does not increase, but in this way the worshiper of the Ganges is benefited. Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers the Lord *patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam* — a leaf, flower, fruit or water — in great devotion, but everything, including the leaf, flower, fruit and water, belongs to the Lord, and therefore there is nothing to renounce or to accept. One must simply take advantage of the *bhakti* process because by following this process one does not lose anything but one gains the favor of the Supreme Person.

### Translation

**Simply by having water from the Ganges come in contact with the ashes of their burnt bodies, the sons of Sagara Mahārāja were elevated to the heavenly planets. Therefore, what is to be said of a devotee who worships mother Ganges faithfully with a determined vow? One can only imagine the benefit that accrues to such a devotee.**

### Translation

**Because mother Ganges emanates from the lotus toe of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Anantadeva, she is able to liberate one from material bondage. Therefore whatever is described herewith about her is not at all wonderful.**

### Purport

It has actually been seen that anyone who regularly worships mother Ganges simply by bathing in her water keeps very good health and gradually becomes a devotee of the Lord. This is the effect of bathing in the water of the Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in all Vedic *śāstras,* and one who takes to this path will certainly be completely freed from all sinful reactions. The practical example of this is that the sons of Mahārāja Sagara went to the heavenly planets when water from the Ganges merely touched the ashes of their burnt bodies.

### Translation

**Bhagīratha had a son named Śruta, whose son was Nābha. This son was different from the Nābha previously described. Nābha had a son named Sindhudvīpa, from Sindhudvīpa came Ayutāyu, and from Ayutāyu came Ṛtūparṇa, who became a friend of Nalarāja. Ṛtūparṇa taught Nalarāja the art of gambling, and Nalarāja gave Ṛtūparṇa lessons in controlling and maintaining horses. The son of Ṛtūparṇa was Sarvakāma.**

### Purport

Gambling is also an art. *Kṣatriyas* are allowed to exhibit talent in this art of gambling. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, the Pāṇḍavas lost everything by gambling and were deprived of their kingdom, wife, family and home because they were not expert in the gambling art. In other words, a devotee may not be expert in materialistic activities. It is therefore advised in the *śāstra* that materialistic activities are not at all suitable for the living entities, especially the devotees. A devotee should therefore be satisfied to eat whatever is sent as *prasāda* by the Supreme Lord. A devotee remains pure because he does not take to sinful activities such as gambling, intoxication, meat-eating and illicit sex.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung:

*hari hari viphale janama goṅāinu  
manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,  
jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu*

The body of a human being is extremely valuable because in this body one can understand the instructions of Kṛṣṇa and attain the ultimate destination of the living entity. The living entity is within the material world to fulfill the mission of going back home, back to Godhead. In the material world, one hankers for happiness, but because one does not know the ultimate destination, one changes bodies one after another. However, if one gets the opportunity to possess a human form of body, in this body he can fulfill the four principles of *dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa,* and if one is properly regulated he makes further progress, after liberation, to engage in the service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. This is the success of life: to stop the process of repeated birth and death and go back home, back to Godhead (*mām eti*), to be engaged in the service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, taking a human body is meant for completing one’s progress in life. Throughout human society, killing of a human being is taken very seriously. Hundreds and thousands of animals are killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of even one human being is taken very seriously. Why? Because the human form of body is extremely important in executing the mission of life.

### Translation

**Here is a learned, highly qualified brāhmaṇa, engaged in performing austerity and eagerly desiring to worship the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul who lives within the core of the heart in all living entities.**

### Purport

The wife of the *brāhmaṇa* did not regard her husband as a superficial *brāhmaṇa* who was called a *brāhmaṇa* merely because he was born of a *brāhmaṇa* family. Rather, this *brāhmaṇa* was actually qualified with the brahminical symptoms. *Yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktam* (*Bhāg.* 7.11.35). The symptoms of a *brāhmaṇa* are stated in the *śāstra:*

*śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ  
kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca  
jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ  
brahma-karma svabhāvajam*

“Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness — these are the qualities by which the *brāhmaṇas* work.” (Bg. 18.42) Not only must a *brāhmaṇa* be qualified, but he must also engage in actual brahminical activities. Simply to be qualified is not enough; one must engage in a *brāhmaṇa’s* duties. The duty of a *brāhmaṇa* is to know the *paraṁ brahma,* Kṛṣṇa (*paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān*). Because this *brāhmaṇa* was actually qualified and was also engaged in brahminical activities (*brahma-karma*), killing him would be a greatly sinful act, and the *brāhmaṇa’s* wife requested that he not be killed.

### Translation

**My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As a son never deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brāhmaṇa who should be protected by the king, and never killed. How does he deserve to be killed by a rājarṣi like you?**

### Purport

The word *rājarṣi* refers to a king who behaves like a *ṛṣi,* or sage. Such a king is also called *naradeva* because he is considered a representative of the Supreme Lord. Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a *brāhmaṇa.* Generally, a *brāhmaṇa,* woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punishable. Thus the wife of the *brāhmaṇa* requested the King to refrain from this sinful act.

### Translation

**You are well known and worshiped in learned circles. How dare you kill this brāhmaṇa, who is a saintly, sinless person, well versed in Vedic knowledge? Killing him would be like destroying the embryo within the womb or killing a cow.**

### Purport

As stated in the *Amara-kośa* dictionary, *bhrūṇo ’rbhake bāla-garbhe:* the word *bhrūṇa* refers either to the cow or to the living entity in embryo. According to Vedic culture, destroying the undeveloped embryo of the soul in the womb is as sinful as killing a cow or a *brāhmaṇa.* In the embryo, the living entity is present in an undeveloped stage. The modern scientific theory that life is a combination of chemicals is nonsense; scientists cannot manufacture living beings, even like those born from eggs. The idea that scientists can develop a chemical situation resembling that of an egg and bring life from it is nonsensical. Their theory that a chemical combination can have life may be accepted, but these rascals cannot create such a combination. This verse refers to *bhrūṇasya vadham* — the killing of a *bhrūṇa* or destruction of the embryo. Here is a challenge from the Vedic literature. The crude, atheistic understanding that the living entity is a combination of matter belongs to the grossest ignorance.

### Translation

**Without my husband, I cannot live for a moment. If you want to eat my husband, it would be better to eat me first, for without my husband I am as good as a dead body.**

### Purport

In the Vedic culture there is a system known as *satī* or *saha-maraṇa,* in which a woman dies with her husband. According to this system, if the husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the blazing funeral pyre of her husband. Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in this culture are expressed by the wife of the *brāhmaṇa.* A woman without a husband is like a dead body. Therefore according to Vedic culture a girl must be married. This is the responsibility of her father. A girl may be given in charity, and a husband may have more than one wife, but a girl must be married. This is Vedic culture. A woman is supposed to be always dependent — in her childhood she is dependent on her father, in youth on her husband, and in old age on her elderly sons. According to *Manu-saṁhitā,* she is never independent. Independence for a woman means miserable life. In this age, so many girls are unmarried and falsely imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable. Here is an instance in which a woman felt that without her husband she was nothing but a dead body.

### Translation

**Being condemned by the curse of Vasiṣṭha, King Saudāsa devoured the brāhmaṇa, exactly as a tiger eats its prey. Even though the brāhmaṇa’s wife spoke so pitiably, Saudāsa was unmoved by her lamentation.**

### Purport

This is an example of destiny. King Saudāsa was condemned by the curse of Vasiṣṭha, and therefore even though he was well qualified he could not restrain himself from becoming a tigerlike Rākṣasa, for this was his destiny. *Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham* (*Bhāg.* 1.5.18). As one is put into distress by destiny, destiny can also put one in a happy situation. Destiny is extremely strong, but one can change destiny if one comes to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. *Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām* (*Brahma-samhitā* 5.54).

Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence, where he engaged his mind fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.**

### Purport

The example of Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga in performing devotional service is brilliant. Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga engaged himself for only a moment in devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to Godhead. Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life, surely he will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (*asaṁśaya*).

In *Bhagavad-gītā* the word *asaṁśaya* is used to describe the devotee. There the Lord Himself gives this instruction:

*mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha  
yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ  
asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ  
yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu*

“Now hear, O son of Pṛthā \Arjuna\], how by practicing *yoga* in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.” ([Bg. 7.1)

The Lord also instructs:

*janma karma ca me divyam  
evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma  
naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 4.9)

Therefore, from the very beginning of one’s life one should practice *bhakti-yoga,* which increases one’s attachment for Kṛṣṇa. If one daily sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity, chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities of the Lord as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to Kṛṣṇa. This attachment is called *āsakti.* When one’s mind is attached to Kṛṣṇa (*mayy āsakta-manāḥ*), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth. If one misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and the chance to return home, back to Godhead. The most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving service to the Lord.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me than the brahminical culture and the brāhmaṇas, who are worshiped by my family. What then is to be said of my kingdom, land, wife, children and opulence? Nothing is dearer to me than the brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga, being in favor of the brahminical culture, wanted to utilize one moment’s time by fully surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is worshiped with this prayer:

*namo brāhmaṇya-devāya  
go brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca  
jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya  
govindāya namo namaḥ*

“I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, who is the well-wisher of the cows and the *brāhmaṇas* as well as the living entities in general. I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses.” A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is very much attached to brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Kṛṣṇa is and what He wants is a real *brāhmaṇa.* *Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ*. Kṛṣṇa is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Kṛṣṇa conscious persons, or devotees of Kṛṣṇa, are exalted *brāhmaṇas.* Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja regarded the devotees of Kṛṣṇa as the real *brāhmaṇas* and the real light for human society. One who desires to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Kṛṣṇa (*kṛṣṇāya govindāya*). Then his life will be successful.

### Translation

**I was never attracted, even in my childhood, by insignificant things or irreligious principles. I did not find anything more substantial than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga provides a typical example of a Kṛṣṇa conscious person. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not see anything to be important but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept anything within this material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord. As stated in *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 8.274):

*sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe, nā dekhe tāra mūrti  
sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti*

“The *mahā-bhāgavata,* the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord.” Although a devotee is within the material world, he has no connection with it. *Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.* He accepts this material world in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee may be engaged in earning money, but he uses that money for propagating the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by constructing large temples and establishing worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja, therefore, was not a materialist. A materialist is always attached to wife, children, home, property and many other things for sense gratification, but, as stated above, Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything existing without the purpose of the Supreme Lord. *Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam:* everything is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the path of devotional service, as prescribed in *The Nectar of Devotion,* he can be trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding. For a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, nothing is palatable without a relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**The demigods, the directors of the three worlds, wanted to give me whatever benediction I desired. I did not want their benedictions, however, because I am interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created everything in this material world. I am more interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead than in all material benedictions.**

### Purport

A devotee is always transcendentally situated. *Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:* one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no longer interested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee as Dhruva Mahārāja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction. He said, *svāmin kṛtārtho ’smi varaṁ na yāce:* “My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me. I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service.” This is the mentality of a pure devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of Godhead. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore called *kṛṣṇa-bhāvanāmṛta-saṅgha,* the association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. Being absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa is neither expensive nor troublesome. Kṛṣṇa says, *man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru:* “Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me.” (Bg. 9.34) Anyone can always think of Kṛṣṇa, without difficulties or obstacles. This is called *kṛṣṇa-bhāvanāmṛta.* One who is absorbed in *kṛṣṇa-bhāvanāmṛta* has no material benefits to ask from Kṛṣṇa. Instead, such a person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories all over the world. *Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi.* A Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not even want to stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, “I may take birth as You like, but my only prayer is that I may be engaged in Your service.”

### Translation

**Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated in the higher planetary system, their minds, senses and intelligence are agitated by material conditions. Therefore, even such elevated persons fail to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally situated in the core of the heart. What then is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer advantages?**

### Purport

It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated in everyone’s heart (*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati*). But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this material world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is situated so near to us. For those always agitated by material conditions, the yogic process is recommended so that one may concentrate his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart. *Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ*. Because in material conditions the mind and senses are always agitated, by the yogic procedures like *dhāraṇā, āsana* and *dhyāna* one must quiet the mind and concentrate it upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the Lord, whereas *bhakti,* devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to realize Him. Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga accepted the spiritual path, and therefore he was no longer interested in anything material. Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55), *bhaktyā mām abhijānāti:* “Only by devotional service can I be understood.” One can understand Kṛṣṇa, the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only through devotional service. The Lord never says that one can understand Him by performing mystic *yoga* or by philosophically speculating. *Bhakti* is above all such material attempts. *Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam.* *Bhakti* is uncontaminated, being unalloyed even by *jñāna* or pious activities.

### Translation

**Therefore I should now give up my attachment for things created by the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I should engage in thought of the Lord and should thus surrender unto Him. This material creation, having been created by the external energy of the Lord, is like an imaginary town visualized on a hill or in a forest. Every conditioned soul has a natural attraction and attachment for material things, but one must simply give up this attachment and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may sometimes see a city in the sky with towers and palaces, or one may see similar things in a big forest. This is called a *gandharva-pura,* a phantasmagoria. This entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and every materially situated person has attachment for it. But Khaṭvāṅga Mahārāja, because of his advanced Kṛṣṇa consciousness, was not interested in such things. Even though a devotee may engage in apparently materialistic activities, he knows his position very well. *Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.* If one engages all material things in relation with the loving service of the Lord, one is situated in *yukta-vairāgya,* proper renunciation. In this material world, nothing should be accepted for one’s sense gratification: everything should be accepted for the service of the Lord. This is the mentality of the spiritual world. Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga advises that one give up material attachments and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one achieves success in life. This is pure *bhakti-yoga,* which involves *vairāgya-vidyā* — renunciation and knowledge.

*vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga-  
śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ  
śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-śarīra-dhārī  
kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye*

“Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared now as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and has come down to teach us material detachment, learning and devotional service to Himself.” (*Caitanya-candrodaya-nāṭaka* 6.74) Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu inaugurated this movement of *vairāgya-vidyā,* by which one detaches himself from material existence and engages in loving devotional service. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of devotional service is the only process by which to counteract our false prestige in this material world.

When one actually becomes purely Kṛṣṇa conscious, no one has any right to rule over him. When situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one is no longer in the darkness of ignorance, and when freed from all such darkness, one is situated in his original position. *Jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya* — *kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa.’* The living entity is eternally the servant of the Lord, and thus when he engages himself in the service of the Lord in all respects, he enjoys the perfection of life.

### Purport

As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.11):

*vadanti tat tattva-vidas  
tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam  
brahmeti paramātmeti  
bhagavān iti śabdyate*

The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases — as Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Bhagavān is the origin of everything. Brahman is a partial representation of Bhagavān, and Vāsudeva, the Supersoul living everywhere and in everyone’s heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But when one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti*), when one realizes that Vāsudeva is both Paramātmā and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in perfect knowledge. Kṛṣṇa is therefore described by Arjuna as *paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.* The words *paraṁ brahma* refer to the shelter of the impersonal Brahman and also of the all-pervading Supersoul. When Kṛṣṇa says *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti,* this means that the perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead. Mahārāja Khaṭvāṅga accepted the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved perfection.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Dynasty of Aṁśumān.”*
