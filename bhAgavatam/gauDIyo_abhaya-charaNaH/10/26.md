CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

In this chapter Nanda Mahārāja describes Kṛṣṇa’s opulences to the cowherd men, as Nanda had heard of them from Garga Muni.

The cowherd men, unaware of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s power, were amazed to see His various extraordinary activities. The men approached Nanda Mahārāja and told him that after seeing how Kṛṣṇa, a boy only seven years old, had lifted a mountain, and how He had previously killed the demoness Pūtanā and generated extreme attraction in the hearts of everyone in Vṛndāvana, the men had become doubtful and bewildered about how Śrī Kṛṣṇa could possibly have taken birth in the unsuitable environment of a cowherd community. Nanda replied by relating to them what Garga Muni had told him about Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Garga Muni had said that in the previous three ages Nanda’s boy had manifested Himself in white, red and yellow forms, whereas now, in the Dvāpara age, He had assumed His darkish-blue form, *kṛṣṇa-rūpa.* Because He descended as the son of Vasudeva, one of His many names is Vāsudeva, and He has innumerable other names indicating His many qualities and activities.

Garga Muni had predicted that Kṛṣṇa would prevent all sorts of catastrophes in Gokula, spread unlimited auspiciousness, and increase the ecstasy of the cowherd men and women. In a previous age He had provided protection for the saintly *brāhmaṇas* when they were harassed by low-class dacoits and there was no proper ruler in society. As the demons in the higher planets can never defeat the demigods who have Lord Viṣṇu on their side, no enemy can ever defeat those who love Kṛṣṇa. In His affinity for His devotees and in His opulence and power, Kṛṣṇa is just like Lord Nārāyaṇa Himself.

Overjoyed and awestruck by Garga Muni’s statements, the cowherd men concluded that Kṛṣṇa must be an empowered representative of the Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa. Thus they worshiped Him and Nanda Mahārāja.

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*evaṁ-vidhāni karmāṇi  
gopāḥ kṛṣṇasya vīkṣya te  
atad-vīrya-vidaḥ procuḥ

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *evam*-*vidhāni* — like this; *karmāṇi* — activities; *gopāḥ* — the cowherd men; *kṛṣṇasya* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *vīkṣya* — seeing; *te* — they; *atat*-*vīrya*-*vidaḥ* — unable to understand His power; *procuḥ* — they spoke; *samabhyetya* — approaching (Nanda Mahārāja); *su*-*vismitāḥ* — very astonished.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: The cowherd men were astonished when they saw Kṛṣṇa’s activities, such as lifting Govardhana Hill. Unable to understand His transcendental potency, they approached Nanda Mahārāja and spoke as follows.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains this verse as follows: “During Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastime of lifting Śrī Govardhana Hill, the cowherd men simply enjoyed the spiritual bliss of the Lord’s activities without analyzing them. But afterwards, when they had returned to their homes, perplexity arose within their hearts. Thus they thought, ‘Now we have directly seen child Kṛṣṇa lift Govardhana Hill, and we remember how He killed Pūtanā and other demons, extinguished the forest fire, and so on. At the time, we thought that these extraordinary acts occurred because of a benediction from the *brāhmaṇas* or because of Nanda Mahārāja’s great fortune, or that perhaps this boy had achieved the mercy of Lord Nārāyaṇa and was thus empowered by Him.

“‘But all these presumptions are false, because an ordinary seven-year old boy could never hold up the king of mountains for seven whole days. Kṛṣṇa is not a human being. He must be the Supreme Lord Himself.

“‘But on the other hand, child Kṛṣṇa loves it when we coddle Him, and He becomes morose when we — His uncles and well-wishers, simply worldly cowherd men — do not give Him attention. He appears to become hungry and thirsty, steals yogurt and milk, sometimes plays tricks, tells lies, chatters childishly and tends the calves. If He is actually the Supreme Lord, why would He do these things? Don’t they indicate that He is an ordinary human child?

“‘We are totally unable to establish the truth of His identity. Therefore let us go and inquire from the highly intelligent King of Vraja, Nanda Mahārāja, and he shall free us from our doubts.’”

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the cowherd men thus made up their minds, and then they entered Nanda Mahārāja’s great assembly hall and questioned him as described in the following verse.

### Verse text

*tokenāmīlitākṣeṇa  
pūtanāyā mahaujasaḥ  
pītaḥ stanaḥ saha prāṇaiḥ  
kāleneva vayas tanoḥ*

### Synonyms

*tokena* — by the young child; *ā*-*mīlita* — almost closed; *akṣeṇa* — whose eyes; *pūtanāyāḥ* — of the witch Pūtanā; *mahā*-*ojasaḥ* — whose power was very great; *pītaḥ* — drunk; *stanaḥ* — the breast; *saha* — along with; *prāṇaiḥ* — her life air; *kālena* — by the force of time; *iva* — as; *vayaḥ* — the life span; *tanoḥ* — of a material body.

### Translation

**As a mere infant who had hardly yet opened His eyes, He drank the breast milk of the powerful demoness Pūtanā and then sucked out her very life air as well, just as the force of time sucks out the youth of one’s body.**

### Purport

The word *vayaḥ* in this verse indicates youth or life span in general. With irresistible power, time takes away our life, and that time is actually Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Thus in the case of the powerful witch Pūtanā, Lord Kṛṣṇa accelerated the time process and within an instant withdrew the duration of her life. Here the cowherd men mean to say, “How could a mere infant who could barely open His eyes so easily kill a very powerful demoness?”

### Purport

The cowherd men, who loved Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary child, were astonished by all these activities. A newborn infant cannot ordinarily kill a powerful witch, and one would hardly think that a one-year-old baby could kill a demon who has kidnapped him and carried him up into the sky. But Kṛṣṇa did all of these wonderful things, and the cowherd men were enhancing their love for Him by remembering and discussing His activities.

### Purport

The two *arjuna* trees were old and thick, and they towered above little Kṛṣṇa’s courtyard. Nevertheless, they were pulled down quite easily by the naughty child.

### Translation

### Translation

**Together with Lord Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa killed the jackass demon and all his friends, thereby securing the safety of the Tālavana forest, which abounded with fully ripened palm fruits.**

### Purport

Long, long ago, the powerful demons Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa were born of the goddess Diti. Therefore demons are commonly called *daiteyas* or *daityas,* meaning “descendants of Diti.” Dhenukāsura, the ass demon, terrorized the Tāla forest with his friends, but Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Balarāma killed them just as modern governments kill terrorists who harass innocent people.

### Verse text

*dustyajaś cānurāgo ’smin  
sarveṣāṁ no vrajaukasām  
nanda te tanaye ’smāsu  
tasyāpy autpattikaḥ katham*

### Synonyms

*dustyajaḥ* — impossible to give up; *ca* — and; *anurāgaḥ* — loving affection; *asmin* — for Him; *sarveṣām* — on the part of all; *naḥ* — us; *vraja*-*okasām* — the residents of Vraja; *nanda* — dear Nanda Mahārāja; *te* — your; *tanaye* — for the son; *asmāsu* — toward us; *tasya* — on His part; *api* — also; *autpattikaḥ* — natural; *katham* — how.

### Translation

**Dear Nanda, how is it that we and all the other residents of Vraja cannot give up our constant affection for your son? And how is it that He is so spontaneously attracted to us?**

### Purport

The very word *kṛṣṇa* means “the all-attractive one.” The residents of Vṛndāvana could not give up their constant love (*anurāga*) for Lord Kṛṣṇa. Their attitude toward Him was not particularly theistic, because they were unsure whether He was God or not. But He attracted all their love precisely because as God He is the all-attractive person, the supreme object of our love.

The cowherd men also asked, “How is it that young Kṛṣṇa feels such constant love for us?” In fact the Supreme Lord loves all living beings, who are eternally His children. At the end of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* Lord Kṛṣṇa dramatically declares His affection for Arjuna and urges Arjuna to reciprocate that love by surrendering to Him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in His prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa, states, *etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ*: “My Lord, You are so merciful toward Me, but I am so unfortunate that love for You has not awakened within Me.” (*Śikṣāṣṭaka* 2) In this statement Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also uses the word *anurāga.* Our misfortune is that we cannot reciprocate the *anurāga,* or loving affection, that the Lord feels for us. Although we are infinitesimal and insignificant and the Lord is infinitely attractive, somehow we do not give Him our love. We must accept responsibility for this foolish decision, since to surrender to God or not is the essential expression of our free will.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement provides an efficient, systematic program to help conditioned souls revive their original, blissful consciousness, which is love of God, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The intricacies of Kṛṣṇa consciousness are so wonderful that even Kṛṣṇa’s eternal associates, the residents of Vṛndāvana, are astonished by them, as shown by these verses.

Now he is instructing the cowherd men with these same words.”

### Translation

**Demons cannot harm the demigods, who always have Lord Viṣṇu on their side. Similarly, any person or group attached to all-auspicious Kṛṣṇa cannot be defeated by enemies.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda has especially indicated in this connection that just as Lord Kṛṣṇa’s associates could not be defeated by Kaṁsa, so His modern-day devotees will not be defeated by their demoniac opponents, nor will the Lord’s devotees be defeated by the internal enemies — the lusty, materialistic senses.

### Verse text

*iti nanda-vacaḥ śrutvā  
garga-gītaṁ taṁ vrajaukasaḥ  
muditā nandam ānarcuḥ  
kṛṣṇaṁ ca gata-vismayāḥ*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Having heard Nanda Mahārāja relate the statements of Garga Muni, the residents of Vṛndāvana became enlivened. Their perplexity was gone, and they worshiped Nanda and Lord Kṛṣṇa with great respect.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that in this verse the word *ānarcuḥ* indicates that the residents of Vṛndāvana honored Nanda and Kṛṣṇa with such offerings as fragrances, garlands and garments brought from their homes. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura adds that the residents of Vṛndāvana honored Nanda and Kṛṣṇa with loving offerings of jewels and gold coins. Apparently, Lord Kṛṣṇa was playing in the forest when this conversation took place, so when He returned home the residents of Vṛndāvana encouraged Him by decorating Him with beautiful yellow garments, necklaces, armlets, earrings and crowns, and by shouting, “All glories, all glories to the jewel of Vṛndāvana!”

### Synonyms

*deve* — when the demigod Indra; *varṣati* — caused rain; *yajña* — of his sacrifice; *viplava* — due to the disturbances; *ruṣā* — out of anger; *vajra* — with lightning bolts; *aśma*-*varṣa* — hail; *anilaiḥ* — and winds; *sīdat* — suffering; *pāla* — the cowherds; *paśu* — animals; *stri* — and women; *ātma* — Himself; *śaraṇam* — being their only shelter; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *anukampī* — very compassionate by nature; *utsmayan* — smiling broadly; *utpāṭya* — picking up; *eka*-*kareṇa* — in one hand; *śailam* — the hill, Govardhana; *abalaḥ* — a small child; *līlā* — in play; *ucchilīndhram* — a mushroom; *yathā* — just as; *bibhrat* — He held; *goṣṭham* — the cowherd community; *apāt* — He protected; *mahā*-*indra* — of King Indra; *mada* — of the false pride; *bhit* — the destroyer; *prīyāt* — may He be satisfied; *naḥ* — with us; *indraḥ* — the Lord; *gavām* — of the cows.

### Translation

**Indra became angry when his sacrifice was disrupted, and thus he caused rain and hail to fall on Gokula, accompanied by lightning and powerful winds, all of which brought great suffering to the cowherds, animals and women there. When Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is by nature always compassionate, saw the condition of those who had only Him as their shelter, He smiled broadly and lifted Govardhana Hill with one hand, just as a small child picks up a mushroom to play with it. Holding up the hill, He protected the cowherd community. May He, Govinda, the Lord of the cows and the destroyer of Indra’s false pride, be pleased with us.**

### Purport

The word *indra* means “lord” or “king.” Thus in this verse Kṛṣṇa is pointedly called *indro gavām,* “the Lord of the cows.” In fact, He is the real Indra, the real ruler, of everyone, and the demigods are merely His servants, representing His supreme will.

It is apparent from this and the previous verses in this chapter that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lifting of Govardhana Hill made quite an impression on the simple cowherd men of Vṛndāvana, and they repeatedly remembered this feat. Certainly anyone who soberly and objectively considers the activities of young Kṛṣṇa will surrender to Him and become His eternal devotee in loving devotional service. That is the rational conclusion one should come to after reading this chapter.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Twenty-sixth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Wonderful Kṛṣṇa.”*
