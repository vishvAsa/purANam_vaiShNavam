CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE

This chapter describes how Akrūra informed Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma of Kaṁsa’s plans and his activities in Mathurā; what the *gopīs* cried out in distress when Kṛṣṇa left for Mathurā; and also the vision of Lord Viṣṇu’s abode that Akrūra saw within the water of the Yamunā.

When Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma offered Akrūra great respect and comfortably seated him on a couch, he felt that all the desires he had reflected on while traveling to Vṛndāvana were now fulfilled. After the evening meal, Kṛṣṇa asked Akrūra whether his trip had been peaceful and whether he was well. The Lord also inquired about how Kaṁsa was behaving toward their family members, and finally He asked why Akrūra had come.

Akrūra described how Kaṁsa had been persecuting the Yādavas, what Nārada had told Kaṁsa and how Kaṁsa had been treating Vasudeva cruelly. Akrūra also spoke of Kaṁsa’s desire to bring Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to Mathurā to kill Them on the pretext of Their seeing the bow sacrifice and engaging in a wrestling match. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma laughed out loud when They heard this. They went to Their father, Nanda, and informed him of Kaṁsa’s orders. Nanda then issued an order to all the residents of Vraja that they should collect various offerings for the King and prepare to go to Mathurā.

The young *gopīs* were extremely upset to hear that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would be going to Mathurā. They lost all external awareness and began to remember Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Condemning the creator for separating them from Him, they began to lament. They said that Akrūra did not deserve his name (*a,* “not”; *krūra,* “cruel”), since he was so cruel to be taking away their dearmost Kṛṣṇa. “It must be that fate is against us,” they lamented, “because otherwise the elders of Vraja would have forbidden Kṛṣṇa to leave. So let us forget our shyness and try to stop Lord Mādhava from going.” With these words the young cowherd girls began to chant Kṛṣṇa’s names and cry.

But even as they wept, Akrūra began taking Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to Mathurā in his chariot. The cowherd men of Gokula followed behind on their wagons, and the young *gopīs* also walked behind for some distance, but then they became placated by Kṛṣṇa’s glances and gestures and pacified by a message from Him that said “I will return.” With their minds completely absorbed in Kṛṣṇa, the cowherd girls stood as still as figures in a painting until they could no longer see the chariot’s flag or the dust cloud being raised on the road. Then, chanting Kṛṣṇa’s glories all the while, they despondently returned to their homes.

Akrūra halted the chariot at the bank of the Yamunā so Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma could perform a ritual of purification and drink some water. After the two Lords had gotten back into the chariot, Akrūra took Their permission to bathe in the Yamunā. As he recited Vedic *mantras,* he was startled to see the two Lords standing in the water. Akrūra came out of the river and returned to the chariot — where he saw the Lords still sitting. Then he returned to the water to find out if the two figures he had seen there were real or not.

What Akrūra saw in the water was four-armed Lord Vāsudeva. His complexion was dark blue like a fresh raincloud, He wore yellow garments and He lay on the lap of thousand-hooded Ananta Śeṣa. Lord Vāsudeva was receiving the prayers of perfected beings, celestial serpents and demons, and He was encircled by His personal attendants. Serving Him were His many potencies, such as Śrī, Puṣṭi and Ilā, while Brahmā and other demigods sang His praises. Akrūra rejoiced at this vision and, joining his palms in supplication, began to pray to the Supreme Lord in a voice choked with emotion.

tvadīyam adrākṣma vayaṁ madhu-dviṣaḥ*

### Synonyms

*krūraḥ* — cruel; *tvam* — you (are); *akrūra*-*samākhyayā* — by the name Akrūra (which means “not cruel”); *sma* — certainly; *naḥ* — our; *cakṣuḥ* — eyes; *hi* — indeed; *dattam* — given; *harase* — you are taking; *bata* — alas; *ajña* — a fool; *vat* — just like; *yena* — with which (eyes); *eka* — in one; *deśe* — place; *akhila* — of all; *sarga* — the creation; *sauṣṭhavam* — the perfection; *tvadīyam* — your; *adrākṣma* — have seen; *vayam* — we; *madhudviṣaḥ* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa, enemy of the demon Madhu.

### Translation

**O Providence, though you come here with the name Akrūra, you are indeed cruel, for like a fool you are taking away what you once gave us — those eyes with which we have seen, even in one feature of Lord Madhudviṣa’s form, the perfection of your entire creation.**

### Purport

The *gopīs* did not care to see anything but Kṛṣṇa; therefore if Kṛṣṇa left Vṛndāvana, their eyes would have no function. Thus Kṛṣṇa’s departure was blinding these poor girls, and in their distress they berated Akrūra, whose name means “not cruel,” as cruel indeed.

They are helping Kṛṣṇa go to Mathurā, but they will have to come back to Vṛndāvana and will certainly die in His absence. The whole world has become nonsensical.”

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes what the *gopīs* thought: “Let us go right up to Kṛṣṇa and pull at His clothes and hands and insist that He get down from His chariot and stay here with us. We will tell Him, ‘Don’t bring upon Yourself the sinful reaction for murdering so many women!’”

“But if we do that,” said other *gopīs,* “our relatives and the village elders will discover our secret love for Kṛṣṇa and abandon us.”

“But what can they do to us?”

“Yes, our lives are already wretched now that Kṛṣṇa is leaving. We have nothing to lose.”

“That’s right. We will remain in the Vṛndāvana forest just like presiding goddesses, and then we can fulfill our true desire — to stay with Kṛṣṇa in the forest.”

“Yes, and even if the elders and our relatives punish us by beating us or locking us up, we can still live happily with the knowledge that Kṛṣṇa is residing in our village. Some of our girlfriends who are not imprisoned will cleverly find a way to bring us the remnants of Kṛṣṇa’s food, and then we can remain alive. But if Kṛṣṇa is not stopped, we will certainly die.”

### Purport

According to some Vaiṣṇava authorities, Akrūra offended the *gopīs* by not consoling them when he took Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā, and because of this offense Akrūra was later forced to leave Dvārakā and be separated from Kṛṣṇa during the episode of the Syamantaka jewel. At that time Akrūra had to take up an ignoble residence in Vārāṇasī.

Apparently, mother Yaśodā and the other residents of Vṛndāvana were not crying like the *gopīs,* for they sincerely believed Kṛṣṇa would be coming back within a few days.

Each of these great personalities was worshiping the Lord by chanting sanctified words of praise in his own unique mood. Also in attendance were the Lord’s principal internal potencies — Śrī, Puṣṭi, Gīr, Kānti, Kīrti, Tuṣṭi, Ilā and Ūrjā — as were His material potencies Vidyā, Avidyā and Māyā, and His internal pleasure potency, Śakti.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains the Lord’s potencies mentioned in these verses: “Śrī is the potency of wealth; Puṣṭi that of strength; Gīr, knowledge; Kānti, beauty; Kīrti, fame; and Tuṣṭi, renunciation. These are the Lord’s six opulences. Ilā is His *bhū-śakti,* also known as *sandhinī,* the internal potency of whom the element earth is an expansion. Ūrjā is His internal potency for performing pastimes; she expands as the *tulasī* plant in this world. Vidyā and Avidyā \[knowledge and ignorance\] are external potencies who cause the living entities’ liberation and bondage, respectively. Śakti is His internal pleasure potency, *hlādinī,* and Māyā is an internal potency who is the basis of Vidyā and Avidyā. The word *ca* implies the presence of the Lord’s marginal energy, the *jīva-śakti,* who is subordinate to Māyā. Lord Viṣṇu was being served by all these personified potencies.”

Then he joined his palms in supplication and, in a voice choked with emotion, very slowly and attentively began to pray.**
