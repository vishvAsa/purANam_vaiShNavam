CHAPTER NINETY

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with His queens in the lakes of Dvārakā. It also relates the queens’ ecstatic prayers in the mood of intense separation from Him, and summarizes the Lord’s pastimes.

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa continued to reside in His opulent capital of Dvārakā, together with the Yadus and His queens. He would enjoy sporting with His wives in the ponds on the palace grounds, squirting water on them with a syringe and being squirted in turn. With His graceful gestures, loving words and sidelong glances, He would enchant their hearts. In this way the queens would become totally absorbed in thoughts of Him. Sometimes, after playing with the Lord in the water, they would address various creatures — *kurarī* and *cakravāka* birds, the ocean, the moon, a cloud, a cuckoo, a mountain, a river and so on — declaring their great attachment to Śrī Kṛṣṇa on the pretext of commiserating with these creatures.

Lord Kṛṣṇa begot ten sons in the womb of each of His queens. Among these sons, Pradyumna was foremost, being equal to His father in all transcendental qualities. Pradyumna married Rukmī’s daughter, and from her womb Aniruddha was born. Aniruddha then married Rukmī’s granddaughter and begot Vajra, who was the only Yadu prince to survive the battle of iron clubs at Prabhāsa. From Vajra descended the remainder of the Yadu dynasty, beginning with Pratibāhu. The members of the Yadu dynasty are virtually innumerable; indeed, just to educate their children the Yadus employed 38,800,000 teachers.

Before Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared, many demons took birth in human families to harass the people of the world and destroy brahminical culture. To subdue them, the Lord ordered the demigods to descend into the Yadu dynasty, which then expanded into 101 clans. All of the Yadus recognized Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and had unflinching faith in Him. While resting, eating, walking and so on, which they often did in His company, they would forget their own bodies in their transcendental happiness.

The Tenth Canto concludes with this promise of success for the sincere hearer: “By regularly hearing, chanting and meditating on the beautiful topics of Lord Mukunda with ever-increasing sincerity, a mortal being will attain the divine kingdom of the Lord, where the inviolable power of death holds no sway.”

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvamī said: The master of the goddess of fortune resided happily in His capital city, Dvārakā, which was endowed with all opulences and populated by the most eminent Vṛṣṇis and their gorgeously dressed wives. When these beautiful women in the bloom of youth would play on the city’s rooftops with balls and other toys, they shone like flashing lightning. The main streets of the city were always crowded with intoxicated elephants exuding mada, and also with cavalry, richly adorned infantrymen, and soldiers riding chariots brilliantly decorated with gold. Gracing the city were many gardens and parks with rows of flowering trees, where bees and birds would gather, filling all directions with their songs.**

### Purport

**Lord Kṛṣṇa was the sole beloved of His sixteen thousand wives. Expanding Himself into that many forms, He enjoyed with each of His queens in her own richly furnished residence. On the grounds of these palaces were clear ponds fragrant with the pollen of blooming utpala, kahlāra, kumuda and ambhoja lotuses and filled with flocks of cooing birds. The almighty Lord would enter those ponds, and also various rivers, and enjoy sporting in the water while His wives embraced Him, leaving the red kuṅkuma from their breasts smeared on His body.**.

One rule of poetic composition practiced by Vaiṣṇava authors is *madhureṇa samāpayet:* “A literary work should conclude in a mood of special sweetness.” Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the most tasteful narrator of transcendental topics, has accordingly included in this last chapter of the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* a description of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s water sports in the attractive setting of Dvārakā, followed by the rapturous prayers of the Lord’s queens.

**As Gandharvas joyfully sang His praises to the accompaniment of mṛdaṅga, paṇava and ānaka drums, and as professional reciters known as Sūtas, Māgadhas and Vandīs played vīṇās and recited poems praising Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa would play with His wives in the water. Laughing, the queens would squirt water on Him with syringes, and He would squirt them back. Thus Kṛṣṇa would sport with His queens in the same way that the lord of the Yakṣas sports with the Yakṣī nymphs.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that this superficial appearance of insanity in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens, as if they had become intoxicated by *dhattūra* or some other hallucinogenic drug, was in fact the manifestation of the sixth progressive stage of pure love of Godhead, technically known as *prema-vaicitrya.* Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī refers to this variety of *anurāga* in his *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (15.134):

*priyasya sannikarṣe ’pi  
premotkarṣa-svabhāvataḥ  
yā viśleṣa-dhiyārtis tat  
prema-vaicitryam ucyate*

“When, as a natural by-product of one’s extreme love, one feels the distress of separation even in the direct presence of the beloved, this state is called *prema-vaicitrya.*”

### Translation

But you are wide awake, O friend, unable to fall asleep. Is it that, like us, you have had your heart pierced to the core by the lotus-eyed Lord’s munificent, playful smiling glances?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the transcendental madness (*unmāda*) of the queens filled them with such ecstasy that they saw their own mood reflected in everyone and everything else. Here they point out to the *kurarī* bird, whom they take to be sorrowing over separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa, that if the Lord actually had any concern for her or themselves, He would not be sleeping comfortably at that moment. They warn the *kurarī* not to expect Kṛṣṇa to hear her lamentation and show some mercy. In case the *kurarī* might think that Kṛṣṇa is sleeping with His queens, they deny this by saying that He is *gupta-bodha:* His whereabouts are unknown to them. He is out in the world somewhere this night, but they have no idea where to go looking for Him. “Ah, dear bird,” they cry, “even though you are a simple creature, your heart has been deeply pierced, just like ours. You must have had some contact, then, with our Kṛṣṇa. What keeps you from giving up your hopeless attachment to Him?”

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī states that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens here confuse the sea surrounding Dvārakā with the celestial Ocean of Milk, from which Lakṣmī and the Kaustubha gem arose long ago. These were taken (*apahṛta*) by Lord Viṣṇu, and they now reside on His chest. The queens presume that the ocean is anxious to see once again the mark of Lakṣmī’s residence and the Kaustubha jewel on the Lord’s chest, and they express their sympathy by saying that they also want to see these marks. But the queens desire even more to see the *kuṅkuma* marks on the Lord’s chest, which He “took” from their breasts when they last embraced Him.

### Synonyms

*megha* — O cloud; *śrī*-*man* — O honored one; *tvam* — you; *asi* — are; *dayitaḥ* — dear friend; *yādava*-*indrasya* — of the chief of the Yādavas; *nūnam* — certainly; *śrīvatsa*-*aṅkam* — upon the one who bears (on His chest) the special mark known as Śrīvatsa; *vayam* — we; *iva* — just as; *bhavān* — your good self; *dhyāyati* — meditate; *prema* — by pure love; *baddhaḥ* — bound; *ati* — extremely; *utkaṇṭhaḥ* — eager; *śavala* — distraught; *hṛdayaḥ* — whose heart; *asmat* — as our (hearts); *vidhaḥ* — in the same manner; *bāṣpa* — of tears; *dhārāḥ* — torrents; *smṛtvā* *smṛtvā* — repeatedly remembering; *visṛjasi* — you release; *muhuḥ* — again and again; *duḥkha* — misery; *daḥ* — giving; *tat* — with Him; *prasaṅgaḥ* — association.

### Translation

**O revered cloud, you are indeed very dear to the chief of the Yādavas, who bears the mark of Śrīvatsa. Like us, you are bound to Him by love and are meditating upon Him. Your heart is distraught with great eagerness, as our hearts are, and as you remember Him again and again you shed a torrent of tears. Association with Kṛṣṇa brings such misery!**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain this verse as follows: The cloud acts as the friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa by shielding Him from the scorching rays of the sun, and certainly such an earnest well-wisher of the Lord must constantly meditate on Him with concern for His welfare. Although the cloud shares the Lord’s blue complexion, it is Lord Kṛṣṇa’s distinctive features, such as His Śrīvatsa mark, that especially attract him to this meditation. But what is the result? Simply unhappiness: the cloud is depressed and thus constantly sheds tears on the pretext of raining. “So,” the queens advise him, “it would be better for you not to take much interest in Kṛṣṇa.”

### Translation

**O sweet-throated cuckoo, in a voice that could revive the dead you are vibrating the same sounds we once heard from our beloved, the most pleasing of speakers. Please tell me what I can do today to please you.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains, though the song of a cuckoo is very pleasant, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives perceive it as painful because it reminds them of their beloved Kṛṣṇa and exacerbates their pain of separation.

**O rivers, wives of the ocean, your pools have now dried up. Alas, you have shriveled to nothing, and your wealth of lotuses has vanished. Are you, then, like us, who are withering away because of not receiving the affectionate glance of our dear husband, the Lord of Madhu, who has cheated our hearts?**

### Purport

During the summer the rivers do not receive downpours of water provided by their husband, the ocean, via the clouds. But the real reason for the rivers’ emaciation, as the queens see it, is that they have failed to obtain the loving glance of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all happiness.

O servant of a petty master, go tell Him who fulfills our desires to come here without the goddess of fortune. Is she the only woman exclusively devoted to Him?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī relates the following conversation between the queens and the swan:

The queens ask, “Is the unconquerable Lord doing well?”

The swan replies, “How can Lord Kṛṣṇa be doing well without you, His beloved consorts?”

“But does He even remember what He once told one of us, Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī? Does He recall that He said, ‘In all My palaces I see no other wife as dear as you’?”

“He does indeed remember this, and that is just why He sent me here. You should all go to Him and engage in His devotional service.”

“Why should we go worship Him if He refuses to come here to be with us?”

“But my dear oceans of compassion, He is suffering so much from your absence! How can He be saved from this distress?”

“Just listen, O servant of a petty master: tell Him to come here, as He should. If He is suffering from lusty desires, He has only Himself to blame, since He Himself is the creator of Cupid’s power. We self-respecting ladies are not going to yield to His demand that we go seek Him out.”

“So be it; then I will take my leave.”

“No, one minute, dear swan. Ask Him to come to us here, but without the goddess of fortune, who always cheats us by keeping Him all to herself.”

“Don’t you know that Goddess Lakṣmī is devoted exclusively to the Lord? How could He give her up like that?”

“And is she the only woman in the world who is completely sold out to Him? What about us?”

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: By thus speaking and acting with such ecstatic love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, the master of all masters of mystic yoga, His loving wives attained the ultimate goal of life.**

### Purport

According to Ācārya Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī, here Śukadeva Gosvāmī uses the present tense of the word *kriyamāṇena* to indicate that the Lord’s queens attained His eternal abode immediately, without delay. By this insight the *ācārya* helps refute the false notion that after Lord Kṛṣṇa’s departure from this world, some primitive cowherds kidnapped His queens while they were under the protection of Arjuna. In fact, as the self-realized Vaiṣṇava commentators elsewhere explain, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared in the guise of the thieves who abducted the queens. For further information on this subject, see Śrīla Prabhupāda’s purport to *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* 1.15.20.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī remarks that the supreme goal attained by these exalted women was not the liberation of the impersonal *yogīs* but the perfect state of *prema-bhakti,* pure loving devotion. Indeed, since they were already imbued with divine love of God from the very beginning, they possessed transcendental bodies of eternity, knowledge and bliss, in which they were fully able to relish the pleasure of reciprocating with the Supreme Lord in his most intimate, sweet pastimes. Specifically, in the opinion of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, their love of God matured into the ecstasy of madness in pure love (*bhāvonmada*), just as the *gopīs’* love did when Kṛṣṇa disappeared from their midst during the *rāsa* dance. At that time the *gopīs* experienced the full development of ecstatic madness, which they expressed in their inquiries from the various creatures of the forest and in such words as *kṛṣṇo ’haṁ paśyata gatim:* “I am Kṛṣṇa! Just see how gracefully I move!” (*Bhāg.* 10.30.19) Similarly, the *vilāsa,* or flourishing transformation, of the ecstatic love of Lord Dvārakādhīśa’s principal queens has produced the *prema-vaicitrya* symptoms they have exhibited here.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains why specifically thirty trillion, rather than an indefinite number of tens of trillions, is stated here to be the number of King Ugrasena’s attendants. He does so by citing the interpretational rule of *kapiñjalādhikaraṇa,* the logic of “referring to pigeons”: Somewhere in the *Vedas* is found the injunction that “one should sacrifice some pigeons.” This plural number should be taken to mean not an indiscriminate number of pigeons, but precisely three of them, since the *Vedas* never leave any matter vague. The rules of Mīmāṁsā interpretation take three as the default number when no specific number is given.

### Translation

**The heavenly Ganges is a holy place of pilgrimage because her waters wash Lord Kṛṣṇa’s feet. But when the Lord descended among the Yadus, His glories eclipsed the Ganges as a holy place. Both those who hated Kṛṣṇa and those who loved Him attained eternal forms like His in the spiritual world. The unattainable and supremely self-satisfied goddess of fortune, for the sake of whose favor everyone else struggles, belongs to Him alone. His name destroys all inauspiciousness when heard or chanted. He alone has set forth the principles of the various disciplic successions of sages. What wonder is it that He, whose personal weapon is the wheel of time, relieved the burden of the earth?**

### Purport

From beginning to end, the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* has been exclusively dedicated to reciting the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, Mathurā and Dvārakā. As Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out, this verse sums up the Tenth Canto by mentioning five special glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa that even His expansions, plenary portions and incarnations do not display.

First, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s reputation eclipsed that of the holy Ganges when He descended into the Yadu dynasty. Previous to this, Mother Ganges was the most sacred of all *tīrthas,* being the water that had bathed Lord Vāmanadeva’s lotus feet. Another river, the Yamunā, became even greater than the Ganges by contacting the dust from Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s feet in the districts of Vraja and Mathurā:

*gaṅgā-śata-guṇā prāyo  
māthure mama maṇḍale  
yamunā viśrutā devi  
nātra kāryā vicāraṇā*

“The renowned Yamunā in My domain of Mathurā is hundreds of times greater than the Ganges. About this there can be no dispute, O goddess.” (*Varāha Purāṇa*)

Second, Lord Kṛṣṇa gave liberation not only to His surrendered devotees but also to those who considered themselves His enemies. Devotees like the cowherd girls of Vraja and others attained His personal association by entering into His eternal pleasure pastimes in the spiritual world, while inimical demons killed by Him attained the *sāyujya-mukti* of merging into His divine form. When He was present on this earth, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s compassion extended to His family, friends and servants, and also to His enemies and their families, friends and servants. Great authorities like Lord Brahmā have mentioned this fact: *sad-veṣād iva pūtanāpi sa-kulā tvām eva devāpitā.* “My Lord, You have already given Yourself to Pūtanā and her family members simply because she dressed herself as a devotee.” (*Bhāg.* 10.14.35)

Third, Goddess Lakṣmī, Lord Nārāyaṇa’s constant companion, whom great demigods serve menially to win her slight favor, was unable to win the privilege of joining the intimate company of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s devotees in Vraja. Despite her eagerness to participate in the *rāsa* dance and other pastimes enacted by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and despite the severe austerities she underwent to achieve that end, she could not transcend her natural mood of reverence. The sweetness and intimacy Lord Kṛṣṇa manifested in Vṛndāvana constitute a unique kind of opulence found nowhere else, even in Vaikuṇṭha. As Śrī Uddhava says:

*yan martya-līlaupayikaṁ sva-yoga-  
māyā-balaṁ darśayatā gṛhītam  
vismāpanaṁ svasya ca saubhagarddheḥ  
paraṁ padaṁ bhūṣaṇa-bhūṣaṇāṅgam*

“To exhibit the strength of His spiritual potency, Lord Kṛṣṇa manifested a form just suitable for His humanlike pastimes in the material world. This form was wonderful even for Him and was the supreme abode of the wealth of good fortune. Its limbs were so beautiful that they increased the beauty of the ornaments worn on different parts of His body.” (*Bhāg.* 3.2.12)

Fourth, the name *Kṛṣṇa* is superior to the name *Nārāyaṇa* and to those of all of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s other expansions. These two syllables — *kṛṣ* and *ṇa* — combine together to destroy all inauspiciousness and illusion. When recited, the name *Kṛṣṇa* becomes *śruta-matha;* that is to say, the recitation of Kṛṣṇa’s name totally crushes (*mathnāti*) the excellence of all other spiritual practices described in the revealed scriptures (*śruta*). In the words of the *Brahmāṇda Purāṇa:*

*sahasra-nāmnāṁ puṇyānāṁ  
trir āvṛttyā tu yat phalam  
ekāvṛttyā tu kṛṣṇasya  
nāmaikaṁ tat prayacchati*

“By uttering the single name of Kṛṣṇa just once, one attains the same benefit as that gained by reciting Lord Viṣṇu’s thousand names three times.”

Fifth, Lord Kṛṣṇa solidly reinstated *dharma,* the bull of religion, on his four legs of compassion, austerity, cleanliness and truth. Thus *dharma* could once again become *go-tra,* the protector of the earth. Śrī Kṛṣṇa also established the religious function of Govardhana-pūjā to honor His favorite hill, the cows and the *brāhmaṇas.* He also became the hill (*gotra*) Himself, assuming its form to accept the cowherds’ offerings. Moreover, He cultivated the *dharma,* or loving nature, of Vraja’s divine cowherds (*gotras*), whose love for Him has never been equaled.

These are just a few of the wonderful features of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s unique personality.

### Synonyms

*jayati* — eternally lives gloriously; *jana*-*nivāsaḥ* — He who lives among human beings like the members of the Yadu dynasty and is the ultimate resort of all living entities; *devakī*-*janma*-*vādaḥ* — known as the son of Devakī (No one can actually become the father or mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore *devakī-janma-vada* means that He is *known* as the son of Devakī. Similarly, He is also known as the son of mother Yaśodā, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja.); *yadu*-*vara*-*pariṣat* — served by the members of the Yadu dynasty or the cowherd men of Vṛndāvana (all of whom are constant associates of the Supreme Lord and are the Lord’s eternal servants); *svaiḥ* *dorbhiḥ* — by His own arms, or by His devotees like Arjuna who are just like His own arms; *asyan* — killing; *adharmam* — demons or the impious; *sthira*-*cara*-*vṛjina*-*ghnaḥ* — the destroyer of all the ill fortune of all living entities, moving and not moving; *su*-*smita* — always smiling; *śrī*-*mukhena* — by His beautiful face; *vraja*-*pura*-*vanitānām* — of the damsels of Vṛndāvana; *vardhayan* — increasing; *kāma*-*devam* — the lusty desires.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is He who is known as jana-nivāsa, the ultimate resort of all living entities, and who is also known as Devakīnandana or Yaśodā-nandana, the son of Devakī and Yaśodā. He is the guide of the Yadu dynasty, and with His mighty arms He kills everything inauspicious, as well as every man who is impious. By His presence He destroys all things inauspicious for all living entities, moving and inert. His blissful smiling face always increases the lusty desires of the gopīs of Vṛndāvana. May He be all glorious and happy!**

### Purport

The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 13.79). According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī has composed this beautiful verse to console those who lament the fact that Lord Kṛṣṇa did not continue to manifest His intimate pastimes down to the present time. Here Śrī Śukadeva reminds his listeners that the Lord is eternally present in this world — in His holy abode, His name and the recitation of His glories. This idea is expressed by the word *jayati* (“He is victorious”), which is in the present tense rather than the past.

Śrīla Prabhupāda explains this verse as follows in *Kṛṣṇa:* “Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī thus concludes his description of the superexalted position of Lord Kṛṣṇa by glorifying Him in the following way: ‘O Lord Kṛṣṇa, all glories unto You. You are present in everyone’s heart as Paramātmā. Therefore You are known as Jananivāsa, one who lives in everyone’s heart.’ As confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* *īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati:* ‘The Supreme Lord in His Paramātmā feature lives in everyone’s heart.’ This does not mean, however, that Kṛṣṇa has no separate existence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Māyāvādī philosophers accept the all-pervading feature of Parabrahman, but when Parabrahman, or the Supreme Lord, appears, they think that He appears under the control of material nature. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Devakī, the Māyāvādī philosophers accept Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary living entity who takes birth within this material world. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī warns them: *devakī-janma-vādaḥ,* which means that although Kṛṣṇa is famous as the son of Devakī, actually He is the Supersoul, or the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead.

“The devotees, however, take this word *devakī-janma-vāda* in a different way. The devotees understand that actually Kṛṣṇa was the son of mother Yaśodā. Although Kṛṣṇa first of all appeared as the son of Devakī, He immediately transferred Himself to the lap of mother Yaśodā, and His childhood pastimes were blissfully enjoyed by mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja. This fact was also admitted by Vasudeva himself when he met Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā at Kurukṣetra. He admitted that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were actually the sons of mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja. Vasudeva and Devakī were only Their official father and mother. Their actual father and mother were Nanda and Yaśodā. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes Lord Kṛṣṇa as *devakī-janma-vāda.*

“Śukadeva Gosvāmī then glorifies the Lord as one who is honored by the *yadu-vara-pariṣat,* the assembly house of the Yadu dynasty, and as the killer of different kinds of demons. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have killed all the demons by employing His different material energies, but He wanted to kill them personally in order to give them salvation. There was no need of Kṛṣṇa’s coming to this material world to kill the demons. Simply by His willing, many hundreds and thousands of demons could have been killed without His personal endeavor. But actually He descended for His pure devotees, to play as a child with mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja and to give pleasure to the inhabitants of Dvārakā. By killing the demons and by giving protection to the devotees, Lord Kṛṣṇa established the real religious principle, which is simply love of God. By following the factual religious principles of love of God, even the living entities known as *sthira-cara* were also delivered from all material contamination and were transferred to the spiritual kingdom. *Sthira* means the trees and plants, which cannot move, and *cara* means the moving animals, especially the cows. When Kṛṣṇa was present, He delivered all the trees, monkeys and other plants and animals who happened to see Him and serve Him both in Vṛndāvana and Dvārakā.

“Lord Kṛṣṇa is especially glorified for giving pleasure to the *gopīs* and the queens of Dvārakā. Śukadeva Gosvāmī glorifies Lord Kṛṣṇa for His enchanting smile, by which He enchanted not only the *gopīs* of Vṛndāvana but also the queens at Dvārakā. The exact words used in this connection are *vardhayan kāmadevam.* In Vṛndāvana, as the boyfriend of many *gopīs,* and in Dvārakā, as the husband of many queens, Kṛṣṇa increased their lusty desires to enjoy with Him. For God realization or self-realization, one generally has to undergo severe austerities and penances for many, many thousands of years, and then it may be possible to realize God. But the *gopīs* and the queens of Dvārakā, simply by enhancing their lusty desires to enjoy Kṛṣṇa as their boyfriend or husband, received the highest type of salvation.”

In this way Śrīla Prabhupāda wonderfully illuminates the meaning of this verse by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, which summarizes Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes.

### Translation

**To protect the principles of devotional service to Himself, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of the Yadus, accepts the pastime forms that have been glorified here in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. One who desires to faithfully serve His lotus feet should hear of the activities He performs in each of these incarnations — activities that suitably imitate those of the forms He assumes. Hearing narrations of these pastimes destroys the reactions to fruitive work.**

### Purport

For the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s* Tenth Canto, this verse is the *phala-śruti,* the promise of success given to one who hears it. The process of devotional service begins with hearing topics about the Supreme Lord. When one has heard these topics properly, he can then proceed to chant them for others’ benefit and reflect on their significance. This leads to faithful adherence to the principles of devotional service, which culminates in absolute faith in Lord Kṛṣṇa. Such perfect faith gives one the right to enter the Lord’s intimate service and, in due course of time, return to one’s eternal, spiritual life in one of the Lord’s personal domains.

Humbly offering his comments on the Tenth Canto at the lotus feet of his worshipable Lord, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī prays:

*mad-gavīr api gopālaḥ  
svī-kuryāt kṛpayā yadi  
tadaivāsāṁ payaḥ pītvā  
hṛṣyeyus tat-priyā janāḥ*

“If Lord Gopāla mercifully accepts the cows of my words, then His dear devotees may enjoy the pleasure of drinking their milk — the nectar produced by hearing them.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Ninetieth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Summary of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Glories.”*

The Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* was completed on December 27, 1988, the anniversary of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura’s disappearance.
