CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR

This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa defeated the opposing kings after kidnapping Rukmiṇī, disfigured Rukmiṇī’s brother Rukmī, brought Rukmiṇī to His capital and married her.

As Śrī Kṛṣṇa was taking Princess Rukmiṇī away, the inimical kings gathered their armies and pursued Him. Lord Baladeva and the generals of the Yādava army turned to face these opponents, blocking their advance. The enemy armies then began pouring incessant showers of arrows upon Lord Kṛṣṇa’s army. Seeing her husband-to-be’s forces under such violent attack, Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī looked at Śrī Kṛṣṇa fearfully. But Kṛṣṇa simply smiled and told her there was nothing to fear because His army would surely destroy the enemy in short order.

Lord Balarāma and the other heroes then began to annihilate the opposing army with *nārāca* arrows. The enemy kings, headed by Jarāsandha, retreated after suffering the destruction of their armies at the hands of the Yādavas.

Jarāsandha consoled Śiśupāla: “Happiness and distress are never permanent and are under the control of the Supreme Lord. Seventeen times Kṛṣṇa defeated me, but in the end I was victorious over Him. Thus seeing that victory and defeat are under the control of destiny and time, I have learned not to succumb to either lamentation or joy. Time now favors the Yādavas, so they have defeated you with only a small army, but in the future time will favor you, and you will surely conquer them.” Consoled in this way, Śiśupāla took his followers and returned to his kingdom.

Rukmiṇī’s brother Rukmī, who hated Kṛṣṇa, was infuriated by Kṛṣṇa’s kidnapping of his sister. So, after vowing before all the kings present that he would not return to Kuṇḍina until Kṛṣṇa had been destroyed and Rukmiṇī rescued, Rukmī set out with his army to attack the Lord. Ignorant of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glories, Rukmī boldly went out to attack Kṛṣṇa in a lone chariot. He approached the Lord, struck Him with arrows and demanded that He release Rukmiṇī. Śrī Kṛṣṇa fended off Rukmī’s weapons, breaking them to pieces. Then He raised His sword high and was about to kill Rukmī when Rukmiṇī interceded and fervently pleaded that her brother’s life be spared. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not kill Rukmī, but with His sword He shaved off bits of Rukmī’s hair here and there, leaving him disfigured. Just then Lord Baladeva appeared on the scene with the Yādava army. Seeing Rukmī disfigured, He gently reproached Kṛṣṇa: “To disfigure such a close family member is as good as killing him; therefore he should not be killed but set free.”

Lord Baladeva then told Rukmiṇī that the sorry condition of her brother was only the fruit of his past work, since everyone is responsible for his own happiness and suffering. He further instructed her about the transcendental position of the *jīva* soul and how the illusion of happiness and distress is simply a result of ignorance. Accepting Lord Balarāma’s instructions, Rukmiṇī gave up her sorrow.

Rukmī, meanwhile, felt totally frustrated, deprived as he was of all his strength and his will to fight. Since he had vowed not to return home without conquering Kṛṣṇa, Rukmī constructed a city on that very spot and took up residence there in a mood of undiminished anger.

Lord Kṛṣṇa took Rukmiṇī to His capital, Dvārakā, and married her. All the citizens celebrated in lavish style, broadcasting throughout the city accounts of how the Lord had kidnapped Rukmiṇī. Everyone in Dvārakā was delighted to see Lord Kṛṣṇa united with Rukmiṇī.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, introduced throughout the world by Śrīla Prabhupāda on the order of his spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who himself preached all over India on the order of his exalted father, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, is broadcasting the loving message of Lord Kṛṣṇa: Remember Him, serve Him, return to Him and share in the infinite bounty of the kingdom of God.

### Purport

By the will of the Supreme Lord, living beings are awarded the proper results of their own activities. One who understands the Absolute Truth surrenders to the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and is no longer considered to be within the material system of existence. Since those endeavoring within the material system, or world, are necessarily trying to exploit the creation of God, they must be subjected to reactions, which are perceived by the conditioned souls as miserable and joyful. In fact, the entire material way of life is a fiasco when seen from the perspective of absolute bliss.

### Purport

Having stated that the Supreme Lord controls this world, Jarāsandha explains the specific method of control. It should be remembered that in the Vedic context *kāla,* or time, does not refer merely to a system of measuring planetary movements such as days, weeks, months and years but rather to the *way* things are being moved. Everything is moving according to its destiny, and this destiny is also described as “time,” since everyone’s destiny is revealed and imposed by the movements of time.

neṣye vīrya-madaṁ yena  
svasā me prasabhaṁ hṛtā*

### Synonyms

*adya* — today; *aham* — I; *niśitaiḥ* — sharp; *bāṇaiḥ* — with my arrows; *gopālasya* — of the cowherd; *su*-*durmateḥ* — whose mentality is most wicked; *neṣye* — I will remove; *vīrya* — in His power; *madam* — the intoxicated pride; *yena* — by which; *svasā* — sister; *me* — my; *prasabham* — violently; *hṛtā* — abducted.

### Translation

**“This wicked-minded cowherd boy, infatuated with His prowess, has violently abducted my sister. But today I will remove His pride with my sharp arrows.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that *gopālasya* actually means “of the protector of the *Vedas,*” while *durmateḥ* means “of Him whose beautiful mind is compassionate even toward the wicked.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that the real meaning of what Rukmī said is that today, fighting with Lord Kṛṣṇa, Rukmī would relieve himself of his pretensions to being a great hero.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes the “worldly rule” that one’s sister is the personification of mercy: *dayāyā bhaginī mūrtiḥ.* Even though Rukmī was wicked and was opposed to his sister’s best interest, Rukmiṇī was compassionate toward him, and the Lord shared her compassion.

### Translation

**\[Turning to Rukmiṇī, Balarāma continued:\] The code of sacred duty for warriors established by Lord Brahmā enjoins that one may have to kill even his own brother. That is indeed a most dreadful law.**

### Purport

Lord Balarāma, in the interest of fairness, is giving a complete analysis of the situation. Although one should not kill a relative, there are extenuating circumstances according to military codes. In the American Civil War, which took place in the 1860s, many families were divided between the army of the North and that of the South, and thus fratricidal killing unfortunately became a common affair. Such killing is certainly *ghoratama,* most dreadful. Yet such is the nature of the material world, where duty, honor and so-called justice often create conflict. Only on the spiritual platform, in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, can we transcend the unacceptable pain of material existence. Rukmī was maddened by pride and envy and thus could not understand anything about Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**\[Again Balarāma addressed Kṛṣṇa:\] Blinded by conceit with their personal opulences, proud men offend others for the sake of such things as kingdom, land, wealth, women, honor and power.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa was originally meant to marry Rukmiṇī. All along this was the best arrangement for all concerned, and yet from the beginning Rukmī had maliciously opposed this beautiful arrangement. When his sister’s desire was finally fulfilled and she was taken by Kṛṣṇa, he viciously attacked the Lord with vulgar insults and mortal weapons. In return Lord Kṛṣṇa tied him up and partially clipped his hair and mustache. While certainly humiliating for a puffed-up prince like Rukmī, his punishment was a mere slap on the wrist, considering what he had done.

एक एव परो ह्यात्मा सर्वेषामपि देहिनाम् ।  
नानेव गृह्यते मूढैर्यथा ज्योतिर्यथा नभ- ॥ ४४ ॥

### Verse text

*eka eva paro hy ātmā  
sarveṣām api dehinām  
nāneva gṛhyate mūḍhair  
yathā jyotir yathā nabhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*ekaḥ* — one; *eva* — only; *paraḥ* — the Supreme; *hi* — indeed; *ātmā* — Soul; *sarveṣām* — among all; *api* — and; *dehinām* — embodied beings; *nānā* — many; *iva* — as if; *gṛhyate* — is perceived; *mūḍhaiḥ* — by those who are bewildered; *yathā* — as; *jyotiḥ* — a celestial body; *yathā* — as; *nabhaḥ* — the sky.

### Translation

**Those who are bewildered perceive the one Supreme Soul, who resides in all embodied beings, as many, just as one may perceive the light in the sky, or the sky itself, as many.**

### Purport

The last line of this text, y*athā jyotir yathā nabhaḥ,* introduces two analogies in which we perceive one thing to be many. *Jyotiḥ* indicates the light of heavenly bodies such as the sun or moon. Although there is only one moon, we may see the moon reflected in pools, rivers, lakes and buckets of water. Then it would appear as if there were many moons, although there is only one. Similarly, we perceive a divine presence in each living being because the Supreme Lord is present everywhere, although He is one. The second analogy given here, *yathā nabhaḥ,* is that of the sky. If we have a row of sealed clay pots in a room, the sky, or air, is in each pot, although the sky itself is one.

The *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.32) gives a similar analogy concerning fire and wood:

*yathā hy avahito vahnir  
dāruṣv ekaḥ sva-yoniṣu  
nāneva bhāti viśvātmā  
bhūteṣu ca tathā pumān*

“The Lord, as the Supersoul, pervades all things, just as fire permeates wood, and so He appears to be of many varieties, though He is the absolute one without a second.”

### Verse text

*deha ādy-antavān eṣa  
dravya-prāṇa-guṇātmakaḥ  
ātmany avidyayā kḷptaḥ  
saṁsārayati dehinam*

### Synonyms

*dehaḥ* — the material body; *ādi* — beginning; *anta* — and end; *vān* — having; *eṣaḥ* — this; *dravya* — of the physical elements; *prāṇa* — the senses; *guṇa* — and the primary modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance); *ātmakaḥ* — composed; *ātmani* — on the self; *avidyayā* — by material ignorance; *kḷptaḥ* — imposed; *saṁsārayati* — causes to experience the cycle of birth and death; *dehinam* — an embodied being.

### Translation

**This material body, which has a beginning and an end, is composed of the physical elements, the senses and the modes of nature. The body, imposed on the self by material ignorance, causes one to experience the cycle of birth and death.**

### Purport

The material body, composed of various material qualities, elements and so on, attracts and repels the conditioned soul and thus entangles him in material existence. Because of our attraction and repulsion for our own body and other bodies, we establish temporary relationships, dedicate ourselves to great endeavors and sacrifices, concoct imaginary religions, make noble speeches and thoroughly involve ourselves in material illusion. As Shakespeare said, “All the world’s a stage.” Beyond the somewhat absurd theater of material existence is the real and meaningful world of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the liberated life of pure souls devoted in loving service to the Supreme Lord.

नात्मनोऽन्येन संयोगो वियोगश्चासत- सति ।  
तद्धेतुत्वात्तत्प्रसिद्धेर्द‍ृग्‌रूपाभ्यां यथा रवे- ॥ ४६ ॥

### Verse text

*nātmano ’nyena saṁyogo  
viyogaś casataḥ sati  
tad-dhetutvāt tat-prasiddher  
dṛg-rūpābhyāṁ yathā raveḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *ātmanaḥ* — for the self; *anyena* — with anything else; *saṁyogaḥ* — contact; *viyogaḥ* — separation; *ca* — and; *asataḥ* — with that which is insubstantial; *sati* — O discriminating one; *tat* — from it (the self); *hetutvāt* — because of originating; *tat* — by it (the self); *prasiddheḥ* — because of being revealed; *dṛk* — with the sense of vision; *rūpābhyām* — and visible form; *yathā* — as; *raveḥ* — for the sun.

### Translation

**O intelligent lady, the soul never undergoes contact with or separation from insubstantial, material objects, because the soul is their very origin and illuminator. Thus the soul resembles the sun, which neither comes in contact with nor separates from the sense of sight and what is seen.**

### Purport

As explained in the previous text, the conditioned soul ignorantly assumes himself to be the material body and thus rotates in the cycle of birth and death. In fact, matter and spirit are co-energies of the original source of everything, the Supreme Lord, who is the Absolute Truth.

As Lord Kṛṣṇa explains in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.5), *jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat.* The material world is sustained by the living beings’ desire to exploit it. The material world is like a prison. Criminals are determined to commit crimes, and thus the government finds it necessary to maintain a prison system. Similarly, the Supreme Lord maintains the material universes because the conditioned souls are determined to rebel against Him and try to enjoy without His loving cooperation. Thus here the phrase *tad-dhetutvāt* is used to describe the soul, meaning that the soul is the cause of matter assembling itself into a material body. The term *tat-prasiddheḥ* indicates that the soul is the cause of the body’s being perceived, and the same term also indicates that this fact is well known to the enlightened.

Besides its given meaning, the word *ātmanaḥ* in this verse may indicate the Supreme Soul, in which case the term *tad-dhetutvāt* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa expands His personal potency and thus manifests the material universe. Since the Lord exists eternally in His pure, spiritual body, He never becomes material, as indicated here.

जन्मादयस्तु देहस्य विक्रियानात्मन- क्व‍‍चित् ।

### Verse text

*janmādayas tu dehasya  
vikriyā nātmanaḥ kvacit  
kalānām iva naivendor  
mṛtir hy asya kuhūr iva*

### Synonyms

*janma*-*ādayaḥ* — birth and so on; *tu* — but; *dehasya* — of the body; *vikriyāḥ* — transformations; *na* — not; *ātmanaḥ* — of the self; *kvacit* — ever; *kalānām* — of the phases; *iva* — as; *na* — not; *eva* — indeed; *indoḥ* — of the moon; *mṛtiḥ* — the death; *hi* — indeed; *asya* — of it; *kuhūḥ* — the new moon day; *iva* — as.

### Translation

**Birth and other transformations are undergone by the body but never by the self, just as change occurs for the moon’s phases but never for the moon, though the new-moon day may be called the moon’s “death.”**

### Purport

Lord Balarāma here explains how the conditioned souls identify with the body and how this identification should be given up. Certainly every ordinary person considers himself or herself young, middle-aged or old, healthy or sick. But such identification is an illusion, just as the waxing and waning of the moon is an illusion. When we identify ourselves with the material body, we lose our power to understand the soul.

*yathā śayāna ātmānaṁ  
viṣayān phalam eva ca  
anubhuṅkte ’py asaty arthe  
tathāpnoty abudho bhavam*

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *śayānaḥ* — a sleeping person; *ātmānam* — himself; *viṣayān* — sense objects; *phalam* — the fruits; *eva* — indeed; *ca* — also; *anubhuṅkte* — experiences; *api* — even; *asati* *arthe* — in that which is not real; *tathā* — so; *āpnoti* — undergoes; *abudhaḥ* — the unintelligent; *bhavam* — material existence.

### Translation

**As a sleeping person perceives himself, the objects of sense enjoyment and the fruits of his acts within the illusion of a dream, so one who is unintelligent undergoes material existence.**

### Purport

As stated in *śruti,* *asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣaḥ:* “The living being has no intimate connection with the material world.” This point is explained in the present verse. A similar statement is found in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.22.56):

*arthe ’hy avidyamāne ’pi  
saṁsṛtir na nivartate  
dhyāyato viṣayān asya  
svapne ’narthāgamo yathā*

“For one who is meditating on sense gratification, material life, although lacking factual existence, does not go away, just as the unpleasant experiences of a dream do not.”

### Translation

**Therefore, with transcendental knowledge dispel the grief that is weakening and confounding your mind. Please resume your natural mood, O princess of the pristine smile.**

### Purport

Lord Balarāma reminds Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī that she is the eternal goddess of fortune performing pastimes with the Lord in this world and should thus give up her so-called grief.

### Translation

**Because he had promised “I will not reenter Kuṇḍina until I have killed wicked Kṛṣṇa and brought back my younger sister,” in a mood of angry frustration Rukmī took up residence at that very place.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the word *bhoja* means “experience” and that, *kaṭaḥ,* according to the *Nānārtha-varga* dictionary, means “vow.” Thus Bhojakaṭa is the place where Rukmī experienced misery as a result of his vow.
