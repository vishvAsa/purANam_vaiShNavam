CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa married five brides, beginning with Kālindī, and went to Indraprastha to visit the Pāṇḍavas.

After the Pāṇḍavas had completed their incognito exile, Lord Kṛṣṇa went with Sātyaki and other Yadus to see them in Indraprastha. The Pāṇḍavas greeted the Lord and embraced Him in great ecstasy. Their new bride, Draupadī, shyly approached Kṛṣṇa and bowed down to Him. Then the Pāṇḍavas properly worshiped and welcomed Sātyaki and the Lord’s other companions, offering them sitting places.

Lord Kṛṣṇa paid a visit to Queen Kuntī, and after He had offered her His respects, they inquired from each other about their family members. As Kuntīdevi recalled the various miseries Duryodhana had inflicted upon her and her sons, she remarked that Kṛṣṇa was their only protector. “You are the well-wisher of the entire universe,” she said, “yet even though You are free from all delusion of ‘mine’ and ‘another’s,’ You nonetheless reside within the hearts of those who meditate on You constantly, and from within their hearts You destroy all their miseries.” Then Yudhiṣṭhira told Kṛṣṇa, “Only because we executed many pious acts are we able to see Your lotus feet, which even great *yogīs* find it impossible to attain.” Honored by King Yudhiṣṭhira, Śrī Kṛṣṇa happily remained as a guest in Indraprastha for several months.

One day, Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna went hunting in the forest. While bathing in the Yamunā River, they saw a charming young maiden. On Kṛṣṇa’s request Arjuna went up to the girl and asked who she was. The beautiful maiden replied, “I am Kālindī, the daughter of the sun-god. Hoping to attain Lord Viṣṇu as my husband, I have been performing severe austerities. I will accept no one else as my husband, and until He marries me I will remain in the Yamunā, living in a house my father built for me here.” After Arjuna reported all this to Kṛṣṇa, the omniscient Lord took Kālindī onto His chariot, and then the three of them returned to Yudhiṣṭhira’s residence.

Later the Pāṇḍavas requested Kṛṣṇa to build them a city, and He did so by having Viśvakarmā, the architect of the demigods, construct one that was extremely attractive. The Lord satisfied His beloved devotees by remaining with them there for some time. Then, to please Agni, the fire-god, Kṛṣṇa arranged to offer him the Khāṇḍava forest. The Lord asked Arjuna to burn down the forest and accompanied him as his charioteer. Agni was so satisfied with the offering that he presented Arjuna with the Gāṇḍīva bow, a team of horses, a chariot, two inexhaustible quivers, and armor. While the Khāṇḍava forest burned, Arjuna saved a demon named Maya from the blaze. Maya Dānava reciprocated by building Arjuna a splendid palace. In this building Duryodhana would later get a good drenching after mistaking the surface of a pond for a solid floor, thus embarrassing himself.

Next Lord Kṛṣṇa took permission from Arjuna and His other relatives and went back to Dvārakā with His entourage. There He married Kālindī. Some time later He went to Avantīpura, where, in the presence of many kings, He abducted the King of Avantī’s sister, Mitravindā, who was very much attracted to Him.

In the kingdom of Ayodhyā lived a devout king named Nagnajit. He had an extraordinarily beautiful, marriageable daughter named Satyā, or Nāgnajitī. The girl’s relatives had laid down the stipulation that any man who could subdue a certain group of seven ferocious bulls would win her hand. When Kṛṣṇa heard about this princess, He went to Ayodhyā with a large contingent of soldiers. King Nagnajit greeted Him hospitably and joyfully worshiped Him with various offerings. When Satyā saw Kṛṣṇa, she immediately desired Him as her husband, and King Nagnajit, understanding his daughter’s intentions, informed Lord Kṛṣṇa of his own wish that the Lord and his daughter be married. The King affectionately told the Lord, “You alone would be a suitable husband for my daughter, and if You subdue the seven bulls You may certainly marry her.”

Lord Kṛṣṇa then manifested Himself in seven separate forms and subdued the seven bulls. King Nagnajit duly presented his daughter to the Lord, together with a dowry of abundant gifts, and the Lord took Satyā onto His chariot for the journey back to Dvārakā. Just then the rival kings who had been defeated by the bulls tried to attack Lord Kṛṣṇa. But Arjuna easily beat them back, and Kṛṣṇa proceeded with Nāgnajitī to Dvārakā.

Subsequently Śrī Kṛṣṇa married Lakṣmaṇā after abducting her from her *svayaṁvara* ceremony, and He also married Bhadrā, the royal sister of Santardana.

*ekadā pāṇḍavān draṣṭuṁ  
pratītān puruṣottamaḥ  
indraprasthaṁ gataḥ śṛīmān  
yuyudhānādibhir vṛtaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *ekadā* — once; *pāṇḍavān* — the sons of Pāṇḍu; *draṣṭum* — to see; *pratītān* — visible; *puruṣa*-*uttamaḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *indraprastham* — to Indraprastha, the Pāṇḍavas’ capital; *gataḥ* — went; *śrī*-*mān* — the possessor of all opulence; *yuyudhāna*-*ādibhir* — by Yuyudhāna (Sātyaki) and others; *vṛtaḥ* — accompanied.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Once, the supremely opulent Personality of Godhead went to Indraprastha to visit the Pāṇḍavas, who had again appeared in public. Accompanying the Lord were Yuyudhāna and other associates.**

### Purport

Almost everyone except Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma had thought the Pāṇḍavas perished in the fire set by Duryodhana in the house of lac. Now the Pāṇḍavas had appeared again in public, and Kṛṣṇa was paying them a visit.

### Verse text

*dṛṣṭvā tam āgataṁ pārthā  
mukundam akhileśvaram  
uttasthur yugapad vīrāḥ  
prāṇā mukhyam ivāgatam*

### Synonyms

*dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *tam* — Him; *āgatam* — arrived; *pārthāḥ* — the sons of Pṛthā (Kuntī); *mukundam* — Kṛṣṇa; *akhila* — of everything; *īśvaram* — the Lord; *uttasthuḥ* — they stood up; *yugapat* — all at once; *vīraḥ* — heroes; *prāṇāḥ* — the senses; *mukhyam* — their chief, the vital air; *iva* — as; *āgatam* — returned.

### Translation

**When the Pāṇḍavas saw that Lord Mukunda had arrived, those heroic sons of Pṛthā all stood up at once, like the senses responding to the return of the life air.**

### Purport

The metaphor used here is quite poetic. When a person is unconscious, the senses do not function. But when consciousness returns to the body, all the senses spring to life at once and begin functioning. Similarly, the Pāṇḍavas all stood up at once, enlivened to receive their Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Verse text

*pariṣvajyācyutaṁ vīrā  
aṅga-saṅga-hatainasaḥ  
sānurāga-smitaṁ vaktraṁ  
vīkṣya tasya mudaṁ yayuḥ*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**The heroes embraced Lord Acyuta, and the touch of His body freed them of sin. Looking at His affectionate, smiling face, they were overwhelmed with joy.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that since the Pāṇḍavas were never sinful, the term *enasaḥ* here refers to the suffering caused by separation from Kṛṣṇa. That unhappiness was now vanquished by the Lord’s return.

### Verse text

*yudhiṣṭhirasya bhīmasya  
kṛtvā pādābhivandanam  
phālgunaṁ parirabhyātha  
yamābhyāṁ cābhivanditaḥ*

### Synonyms

*yudhiṣṭhirasya* *bhīmasya* — to Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīma; *kṛtvā* — after offering; *pāda* — at their feet; *abhivandanam* — obeisances; *phālgunam* — Arjuna; *parirabhya* — firmly embracing; *atha* — then; *yamābhyām* — by the twin brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva; *ca* — and; *abhivanditaḥ* — greeted respectfully.

### Translation

**After the Lord bowed down at the feet of Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīma and firmly embraced Arjuna, He accepted obeisances from the twin brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva.**

### Purport

Externally Kṛṣṇa was the Pāṇḍavas’ cousin, and their relationship was just like that between cousin-brothers. Because Yudhiṣṭhira and Bhīma were externally senior to Kṛṣṇa, the Lord bowed down at their feet, whereas He embraced His peer Arjuna and accepted obeisances from the younger brothers, Nakula and Sahadeva. Sometimes inexperienced devotees think it is sinful to honor or bow down to an elder brother in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But from Lord Kṛṣṇa’s example here we may conclude that offering all respects to a senior brother in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not sinful.

परमासन आसीनं कृष्णा कृष्णमनिन्दिता ।

### Verse text

*paramāsana āsīnaṁ  
kṛṣṇā kṛṣṇam aninditā  
navoḍhā vrīḍitā kiñcic  
chanair etyābhyavandata*

### Synonyms

*parama* — exalted; *āsane* — on a seat; *āsīnam* — sitting; *kṛṣṇā* — Draupadī; *kṛṣṇam* — Kṛṣṇa; *aninditā* — blameless; *nava* — newly; *ūḍhā* — married; *vrīḍitā* — shy; *kiñcit* — somewhat; *śanaiḥ* — slowly; *etya* — approaching; *abhyavandata* — offered her obeisances.

### Translation

**Faultless Draupadī, the Pāṇḍavas’ newly married wife, slowly and somewhat timidly approached Lord Kṛṣṇa, who sat on an exalted seat, and offered Him her obeisances.**

### Purport

Śrīmatī Draupadī was so devoted to Kṛṣṇa that she herself was called Kṛṣṇā, which is the feminine form of the name, and Arjuna was also called Kṛṣṇa because of his devotion to the Lord. Similarly, the devotees of the modern Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are often called “the Kṛṣṇas.” So it appears that the custom of addressing Kṛṣṇa’s devotees by His name has a long history.

### Translation

**The Lord then went to see His aunt, Queen Kuntī. He bowed down to her and she embraced Him, her eyes moist with great affection. Lord Kṛṣṇa inquired from her and her daughter-in-law, Draupadī, about their welfare, and they in turn questioned Him at length about His relatives \[in Dvārakā\].**

### Purport

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura envisions that as Lord Kṛṣṇa was sitting on His seat, He saw His aunt Kuntī approaching in great eagerness to see Him. He then rose at once, quickly went up to her and offered His obeisances. Her eyes moistened with extreme love, she embraced Him and smelled His head.

*na te ’sti sva-para-bhrāntir  
viśvasya suhṛd-ātmanaḥ  
tathāpi smaratāṁ śaśvat  
kleśān haṁsi hṛdi sthitaḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *te* — for You; *asti* — there is; *sva* — of one’s own; *para* — and of others’; *bhrāntiḥ* — delusion; *viśvasya* — of the universe; *suhṛt* — for the well-wisher; *ātmanaḥ* — and Soul; *tathā* *api* — nonetheless; *smaratām* — of those who remember; *śaśvat* — continuously; *kleśān* — the sufferings; *haṁsi* — You destroy; *hṛdi* — in the heart; *sthitaḥ* — situated.

### Translation

**For You, the well-wishing friend and Supreme Soul of the universe, there is never any illusion of “us” and “them.” Yet even so, residing within the hearts of all, You eradicate the sufferings of those who remember You constantly.**

### Purport

The intelligent Queen Kuntī here points out that even though Lord Kṛṣṇa is dealing with her affectionately as a relative, He is not compromising His position as the well-wishing Soul of the universe. In other words, the Lord doesn’t play favorites. As He says in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29), *samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu:* “I am equal to everyone.” So while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention, for they want Him and nothing else.

### Purport

### Translation

**A crew of servants carried to King Yudhiṣṭhira the slain animals fit to be offered in sacrifice on some special occasion. Then, feeling thirsty and tired, Arjuna went to the bank of the Yamunā.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Prabhupāda often explained, the *kṣatriyas,* or warriors, would hunt in the forest for several purposes: to practice their fighting skills, to control the population of ferocious beasts, who were a threat to human beings, and to provide animals for Vedic sacrifices. The killed animals would be given new bodies by the power of the sacrifices. Since priests no longer have that power, the sacrifices would now constitute mere killing and are thus forbidden.

In the Fourth Canto of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* we find that the great sage Nārada severely chastised King Prācīnabarhiṣat for abusing this principle of authorized hunting. In fact, the King had become like modern sportsmen, who cruelly kill animals as a so-called hobby.

नान्यं पतिं वृणे वीर तमृते श्रीनिकेतनम् ।

### Verse text

*nānyaṁ patiṁ vṛṇe vīra  
tam ṛte śrī-niketanam  
tuṣyatāṁ me sa bhagavān  
mukundo ’nātha-saṁśrayaḥ*

### Translation

**I will accept no husband other than Him, the abode of the goddess of fortune. May that Mukunda, the Supreme Personality, the shelter of the helpless, be pleased with me.**

### Purport

The beautiful Kālindī here reveals some apprehension. She insists that she will not accept any husband except Lord Kṛṣṇa, and she states that He is the shelter for those who have no other master. Since she will accept no other shelter, Kṛṣṇa must give her shelter. Also, she says, *tuṣyatāṁ me sa bhagavān:* “May that Supreme Lord be pleased with me.” This is her prayer.

As Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out, although Kālindī is a young, helpless girl staying in a secluded place, she is not afraid. This staunch faith in and devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa is ideal Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and Śrīmatī Kālindī’s desire will soon be fulfilled.

### Purport

Since Kālindī was a beloved child of the sun-god himself, who would dare disturb her? From this incident we can appreciate the beautiful spiritual processes executed in previous ages by great souls. Unlike the so-called love in worldly “love affairs,” beautiful Kālindī’s love for Lord Kṛṣṇa was pure and perfect. Even though Kālindī was a tender young girl, her determination to marry Kṛṣṇa was so strong that she arranged for her father to build her a house in the Yamunā where she could perform severe austerities until the day her beloved came.

### Translation

**The Supreme Lord stayed in that city for some time to please His devotees. On one occasion, Śrī Kṛṣṇa wanted to give the Khāṇḍava forest as a gift to Agni, and so the Lord became Arjuna’s charioteer.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains the sequence of events that occurred during Lord Kṛṣṇa’s stay with the Pāṇḍavas. He states that first the Khāṇḍava forest was burned, then Kālindī was found, then the city was constructed, and then the assembly hall was presented to the Pāṇḍavas.
