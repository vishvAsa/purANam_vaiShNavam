CHAPTER SEVENTY-ONE

This chapter relates how Lord Kṛṣṇa followed Uddhava’s advice and went to Indraprastha, where the Pāṇḍavas celebrated His arrival with great festivity.

Wise Uddhava, knowing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s inner desire, advised the Lord as follows: “By conquering all directions and then performing the Rājasūya sacrifice, King Yudhiṣṭhira will fulfill all his purposes — defeating Jarāsandha, protecting those who have taken shelter of You, and executing the Rājasūya-yajña. Thus the Yādavas’ powerful enemy will be destroyed and the imprisoned kings freed, and both deeds will glorify You.

“King Jarāsandha can be killed only by Bhīma, and since Jarāsandha is very devoted to the *brāhmaṇas,* Bhīma should disguise himself as a *brāhmaṇa,* go to Jarāsandha and beg a fight from him. Then, in Your presence, Bhīma will defeat the demon.”

Nārada Muni, the Yādava elders and Lord Kṛṣṇa praised Uddhava’s plan, and Lord Kṛṣṇa proceeded to mount His chariot and head for Indraprastha, followed by His devoted queens. Soon Lord Kṛṣṇa arrived in that city. Hearing of the Lord’s arrival, King Yudhiṣṭhira immediately came out of the city to greet Him. Yudhiṣṭhira repeatedly embraced Lord Kṛṣṇa, losing external consciousness in his ecstasy. Then Bhīmasena, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and others each embraced or bowed down to Him, as was appropriate.

After Lord Kṛṣṇa had properly greeted everyone, He entered the city as a fanfare of many musical instruments played and reverential hymns were chanted. The women of the city scattered flowers down from the rooftops, remarking on the extreme good fortune of the Lord’s queens.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered the royal palace and offered respects to Queen Kuntīdevī, who embraced her nephew, and Draupadī and Subhadrā offered obeisances to the Lord. Kuntīdevī then requested Draupadī to worship Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, gratified King Yudhiṣṭhira by remaining there for some months. During this stay He enjoyed strolling here and there. He would drive on chariots with Arjuna, followed by many warriors and soldiers.

### Verse text

śrī-uddhava uvāca  
*yad uktam ṛṣinā deva  
sācivyaṁ yakṣyatas tvayā  
kāryaṁ paitṛ-ṣvasreyasya  
rakṣā ca śaraṇaiṣiṇām*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*uddhavaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Uddhava said; *yat* — what; *uktam* — was stated; *ṛṣinā* — by the sage (Nārada); *deva* — O Lord; *sācivyam* — assistance; *yakṣyataḥ* — to him who intends to perform sacrifice (Yudhiṣṭhira); *tvayā* — by You; *kāryam* — should be rendered; *paitṛ*-*ṣvasreyasya* — to Your father’s sister’s son; *rakṣā* — protection; *ca* — also; *śaraṇa* — shelter; *eṣiṇām* — for those who desire.

### Translation

**Śrī Uddhava said: O Lord, as the sage advised, You should help Your cousin fulfill his plan for performing the Rājasūya sacrifice, and You should also protect the kings who are begging for Your shelter.**

### Purport

Devarṣi Nārada wanted Lord Kṛṣṇa to go to Indraprastha and help His cousin Yudhiṣṭhira perform the Rājasūya sacrifice. At the same time, the members of the royal assembly strongly desired that He defeat Jarāsandha and rescue the kings he was holding prisoner. The great-minded Uddhava could understand that Lord Kṛṣṇa desired to do both things, and thus he intelligently advised how both these purposes could be simultaneously accomplished.

यष्टव्यं राजसूयेन दिक्च‍क्रजयिना विभो ।  
अतो जरासुतजय उभयार्थो मतो मम ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*yaṣṭavyam rājasūyena  
dik-cakra-jayinā vibho  
ato jarā-suta-jaya  
ubhayārtho mato mama*

### Synonyms

*yaṣṭavyam* — sacrifice should be performed; *rājasūyena* — with the Rājasūya ritual; *dik* — of directions; *cakra* — the complete circle; *jayinā* — by one who has conquered; *vibho* — O almighty one; *ataḥ* — therefore; *jarā*-*suta* — of the son of Jarā; *jayaḥ* — the conquest; *ubhaya* — both; *arthaḥ* — having the purposes; *mataḥ* — opinion; *mama* — my.

### Translation

**Only one who has conquered all opponents in every direction can perform the Rājasūya sacrifice, O almighty one. Thus, in my opinion, conquering Jarāsandha will serve both purposes.**

### Purport

Śrī Uddhava here explains that only one who has conquered all directions is entitled to perform the Rājasūya sacrifice. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa should immediately accept the invitation to participate in the sacrifice, but then He should arrange to kill Jarāsandha as a necessary prerequisite. In this way the kings’ request for protection would be fulfilled automatically. If the Lord would thus adhere to a single policy — namely, seeing that the Rājasūya sacrifice was performed properly — all purposes would be fulfilled.

According to Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* one of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s qualities is *catura,* “clever,” which means that He can perform various types of work at the same time. Thus the Lord could certainly have solved the dilemma of how to simultaneously satisfy King Yudhiṣṭhira’s desire to perform the Rājasūya sacrifice and the imprisoned kings’ desire for freedom. But Kṛṣṇa wanted to give His dear devotee Uddhava the credit for the solution, and thus He pretended to be perplexed.

### Purport

Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the Yādavas were extremely eager to kill Jarāsandha, and thus to caution them Śrī Uddhava spoke this verse. Jarāsandha’s death could come only at the hand of Bhīma. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that Uddhava had previously deduced this from the *Jyotīr-rāga* and other astrological scriptures he had learned from his teacher Bṛhaspati.

द्वैरथे स तु जेतव्यो मा शताक्षौहिणीयुत- ।  
ब्राह्मण्योऽभ्यर्थितो विप्रैर्न प्रत्याख्याति कर्हिचित् ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*dvai-rathe sa tu jetavyo  
mā śatākṣauhiṇī-yutaḥ  
brāhmaṇyo ’bhyarthito viprair  
na pratyākhyāti karhicit*

### Synonyms

*dvai*-*rathe* — in combat involving only two chariots; *saḥ* — he; *tu* — but; *jetavyaḥ* — is to be defeated; *mā* — not; *śata* — by one hundred; *akṣauhiṇī* — military divisions; *yutaḥ* — joined; *brāhmaṇyaḥ* — devoted to brahminical culture; *abhyarthitaḥ* — entreated; *vipraiḥ* — by *brāhmaṇas*; *na* *pratyākhyāti* — does not refuse; *karhicit* — ever.

### Translation

**He will be defeated in a match of single chariots, not when he is with his hundred military divisions. Now, Jarāsandha is so devoted to brahminical culture that he never refuses requests from brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

It might be argued that since only Bhīma could equal Jarāsandha in personal strength, Jarāsandha would be more powerful when supported by his huge army. Therefore, Uddhava here recommends single combat. But how could Jarāsandha be persuaded to give up the support of his powerful army? Here Uddhava gives the clue: Jarāsandha will never refuse a request from *brāhmaṇas,* since he is devoted to brahminical culture.

### Translation

**Bhīma should go to him disguised as a brāhmaṇa and beg charity. Thus he will obtain single combat with Jarāsandha, and in Your presence Bhīma will no doubt kill him.**

### Purport

The idea is that Bhīma should beg as charity a one-to-one fight with Jarāsandha.

निमित्तं परमीशस्य विश्वसर्गनिरोधयो- ।

### Verse text

*nimittaṁ param īśasya

### Translation

**Even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva act only as Your instruments in cosmic creation and annihilation, which are ultimately done by You, the Supreme Lord, in Your invisible aspect of time.**

### Purport

Uddhava here explains that in fact Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself will cause the death of Jarāsandha, and Bhīma will merely be the instrument. The Supreme Lord, through His invisible potency of time, creates and annihilates the entire cosmic situation, whereas great demigods such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are merely the instruments of the Lord’s will. Therefore Bhīma will have no difficulty acting as the Lord’s instrument to kill the powerful Jarāsandha. In this way, by the Lord’s arrangement, His devotee Bhīma will be glorified.

### Translation

**In their homes, the godly wives of the imprisoned kings sing of Your noble deeds — about how You will kill their husbands’ enemy and deliver them. The gopīs also sing Your glories — how You killed the enemy of the elephant king, Gajendra; the enemy of Sīta, daughter of Janaka; and the enemies of Your own parents as well. So also do the sages who have obtained Your shelter glorify You, as do we ourselves.**

### Purport

Great sages and devotees had informed the grief-stricken wives of the imprisoned kings that Lord Kṛṣṇa would arrange for the killing of Jarāsandha and would thus save them from their crisis. These godly women would thus sing the glories of the Lord at home, and when their children would cry for their fathers, their mothers would tell them, “Child, do not cry. Śrī Kṛṣṇa will save your father.” In fact, the Lord has saved many devotees in the past, as described here.

### Verse text

*jarāsandha-vadhaḥ kṛṣṇa  
bhūry-arthāyopakalpate

### Synonyms

### Translation

**O Kṛṣṇa, the killing of Jarāsandha, which is certainly a reaction of his past sins, will bring immense benefit. Indeed, it will make possible the sacrificial ceremony You desire.**

### Purport

Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the word *bhūry-artha,* “immense benefit,” signifies that with the death of Jarāsandha it will become easy to kill the demon Śiśupāla and to realize other objectives. The great commentator Śrīdhara Svāmī further explains that the term *pāka* indicates that the kings will be saved as a result of their piety, and that the term *vipākena* indicates that Jarāsandha will die as a result of his wickedness. In either case, the plan Uddhava has proposed is most favorable for the execution of the great Rājasūya sacrifice, desired by both the Lord and His pure devotees the Pāṇḍavas, headed by King Yudhiṣṭhira.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the term *acyutam* indicates that Uddhava’s proposal was “fortified by logical reasoning.” Furthermore, Śukadeva Gosvāmī specifically indicates by the term *yadu-vṛddhāḥ* that it was the senior members, not the junior ones, who welcomed the proposal. Young princes such as Aniruddha did not like Uddhava’s proposal, since they were eager to fight Jarāsandha’s army immediately.

### Purport

Having accepted Uddhava’s proposal, Lord Kṛṣṇa first proceeded with His wives, family and entourage to the royal city of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pāṇḍavas. The rest of this chapter describes Lord Kṛṣṇa’s journey to that city and how He was received there by His loving devotees. In Indraprastha Lord Kṛṣṇa explained to the Pāṇḍavas His plan to first kill Jarāsandha and then perform the Rājasūya sacrifice, and with their full agreement He proceeded, with Bhīmasena, to settle accounts with the wicked king.

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives had also been invited to the Rājasūya sacrifice and were eager to go. The description of the colorful royal procession begins with the following verse.

### Translation

**As songs and musical instruments resounded along with the loud vibration of Vedic hymns, the King went forth with great reverence to meet Lord Hṛṣīkeśa, just as the senses go forth to meet the consciousness of life.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa is here described as Hṛṣīkeśa, the Lord of the senses, and King Yudhiṣṭhira’s rushing to the Lord is compared to the senses eagerly joining the consciousness of life. Without consciousness, the senses are useless; indeed, the senses function through consciousness. Similarly, when the individual souls are bereft of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love of God, they enter into a useless and illusory struggle called material existence. Pure devotees like King Yudhiṣṭhira are never bereft of the Lord’s association, for they keep Him always within their heart, and yet they feel special ecstasy when they see the Lord after long separation, as described here.

He completely forgot that he was living in this material world.**

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions that since Arjuna was considered Lord Kṛṣṇa’s social equal, when Arjuna tried to bow down to Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa held Arjuna by his arms so that he could only embrace Him. The twins, however, being junior cousins, bowed down and grasped Lord Kṛṣṇa’s feet.

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes in *Kṛṣṇa:* “It was during this time that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, with the help of Arjuna, for the satisfaction of the fire-god, Agni, allowed Agni to devour the Khāṇḍava forest. During the forest fire, Kṛṣṇa saved the demon Mayāsura, who was hiding in the forest. Upon being saved, Mayāsura felt obliged to the Pāṇḍavas and Lord Kṛṣṇa, and he constructed a wonderful assembly house within the city of Hastināpura. In this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa, in order to please King Yudhiṣṭhira, remained in the city of Hastināpura for several months. During His stay, He enjoyed strolling here and there. He used to drive on chariots along with Arjuna, and many warriors and soldiers used to follow them.”
