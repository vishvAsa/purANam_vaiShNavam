CHAPTER FIVE

As described in this chapter, Nanda Mahārāja very gorgeously performed the birth ceremony for his newborn child. Then he went to Kaṁsa to pay taxes due and met his intimate friend Vasudeva.

There was great jubilation all over Vṛndāvana due to Kṛṣṇa’s birth. Everyone was overwhelmed with joy. Therefore the King of Vraja, Mahārāja Nanda, wanted to perform the birth ceremony for his child, and this he did. During this great festival, Nanda Mahārāja gave in charity to all present whatever they desired. After the festival, Nanda Mahārāja put the cowherd men in charge of protecting Gokula, and then he went to Mathurā to pay official taxes to Kaṁsa. In Mathurā, Nanda Mahārāja met Vasudeva. Nanda Mahārāja and Vasudeva were brothers, and Vasudeva praised Nanda Mahārāja’s good fortune because he knew that Kṛṣṇa had accepted Nanda Mahārāja as His father. When Vasudeva inquired from Nanda Mahārāja about the welfare of the child, Nanda Mahārāja informed him all about Vṛndāvana, and Vasudeva was very much satisfied by this, although he expressed his grief because Devakī’s many children had been killed by Kaṁsa. Nanda Mahārāja consoled Vasudeva by saying that everything happens according to destiny and that one who knows this is not aggrieved. Expecting many disturbances in Gokula, Vasudeva then advised Nanda Mahārāja not to wait in Mathurā, but to return to Vṛndāvana as soon as possible. Thus Nanda Mahārāja took leave of Vasudeva and returned to Vṛndāvana with the other cowherd men on their bullock carts.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Nanda Mahārāja was naturally very magnanimous, and when Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared as his son, he was overwhelmed by jubilation. Therefore, after bathing and purifying himself and dressing himself properly, he invited brāhmaṇas who knew how to recite Vedic mantras. After having these qualified brāhmaṇas recite auspicious Vedic hymns, he arranged to have the Vedic birth ceremony celebrated for his newborn child according to the rules and regulations, and he also arranged for worship of the demigods and forefathers.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has discussed the significance of the words *nandas tu.* The word *tu,* he says, is not used to fulfill the sentence, because without *tu* the sentence is complete. Therefore the word *tu* is used for a different purpose. Although Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Devakī, Devakī and Vasudeva did not enjoy the *jāta-karma,* the festival of the birth ceremony. Instead, this ceremony was enjoyed by Nanda Mahārāja, as stated here (*nandas tv ātmaja utpanne jātāhlādo mahā-manāḥ*). When Nanda Mahārāja met Vasudeva, Vasudeva could not disclose, “Your son Kṛṣṇa is actually my son. You are His father in a different way, spiritually.” Because of fear of Kaṁsa, Vasudeva could not observe the festival for Kṛṣṇa’s birth. Nanda Mahārāja, however, took full advantage of this opportunity.

The *jāta-karma* ceremony can take place when the umbilical cord, connecting the child and the placenta, is cut. However, since Kṛṣṇa was brought by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mahārāja, where was the chance for this to happen? In this regard, Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura desires to prove with evidence from many *śāstras* that Kṛṣṇa actually took birth as the son of Yaśodā before the birth of Yoga-māyā, who is therefore described as the Lord’s younger sister. Even though there may be doubts about the cutting of the umbilical cord, and even though it is possible that this was not done, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, such events are regarded as factual. Kṛṣṇa appeared as Varāhadeva from the nostril of Brahmā, and therefore Brahmā is described as the father of Varāhadeva. Also significant are the words *kārayām āsa vidhivat.* Being overwhelmed with jubilation over the birth of his son, Nanda Mahārāja did not see whether the cord was cut or not. Thus he performed the ceremony very gorgeously. According to the opinion of some authorities, Kṛṣṇa was actually born as the son of Yaśodā. In any case, without regard for material understandings, we can accept that Nanda Mahārāja’s celebration for the ceremony of Kṛṣṇa’s birth was proper. This ceremony is therefore well known everywhere as Nandotsava.

By satisfaction, the mind is purified; and by self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the soul is purified.**

### Purport

These are śāstric injunctions concerning how one can purify everything according to Vedic civilization. Unless purified, anything we use will infect us with contamination. In India five thousand years ago, even in the villages such as that of Nanda Mahārāja, people knew know to purify things, and thus they enjoyed even material life without contamination.

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has instructed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.44), *kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma-svabhāvajam:* “Farming, cow protection and trade are the qualities of work for the *vaiśyas.*” Nanda Mahārāja belonged to the *vaiśya* community, the agriculturalist community. How to protect the cows and how rich this community was are explained in these verses. We can hardly imagine that cows, bulls and calves could be cared for so nicely and decorated so well with cloths and valuable golden ornaments. How happy they were. As described elsewhere in the *Bhāgavatam,* during Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira’s time the cows were so happy that they used to muddy the pasturing ground with milk. This is Indian civilization. Yet in the same place, India, Bhārata-varṣa, how much people are suffering by giving up the Vedic way of life and not understanding the teachings of *Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Purport

When we consider the past condition of the agriculturalist in the village, we can see how opulent he was, simply because of agricultural produce and protection of cows. At the present, however, agriculture having been neglected and cow protection given up, the agriculturalist is suffering pitiably and is dressed in a niggardly torn cloth. This is the distinction between the India of history and the India of the present day. By the atrocious activities of *ugra-karma,* how we are killing the opportunity of human civilization!

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Their lotuslike faces extraordinarily beautiful, being decorated with saffron and newly grown kuṅkuma, the wives of the cowherd men hurried to the house of mother Yaśodā with presentations in their hands. Because of natural beauty, the wives had full hips and full breasts, which moved as they hurried along.**

### Purport

The cowherd men and women in the villages lived a very natural life, and the women developed a natural feminine beauty, with full hips and breasts. Because women in modern civilization do not live naturally, their hips and breasts do not develop this natural fullness. Because of artificial living, women have lost their natural beauty, although they claim to be independent and advanced in material civilization. This description of the village women gives a clear example of the contrast between natural life and the artificial life of a condemned society, such as that of the Western countries, where topless, bottomless beauty may be easily purchased in clubs and shops and for public advertisements. The word *balibhiḥ* indicates that the women were carrying gold coins, jeweled necklaces, nice cloths, newly grown grass, sandalwood pulp, flower garlands and similar offerings on plates made of gold. Such offerings are called *bali.* The words *tvaritaṁ jagmuḥ* indicate how happy the village women were to understand that mother Yaśodā had given birth to a wonderful child known as Kṛṣṇa.

*gopyaḥ* — the *gopīs*; *su*-*mṛṣṭa* — very dazzling; *maṇi* — made of jewels; *kuṇḍala* — wearing earrings; *niṣka*-*kaṇṭhyaḥ* — and having little keys and lockets hanging from their necks; *citra*-*ambarāḥ* — dressed with varieties of colored embroidery; *pathi* — on their way to Yaśodāmayī’s house; *śikhā*-*cyuta* — fell from their hair; *mālya*-*varṣāḥ* — a shower of flower garlands; *nanda*-*ālayam* — to the house of Mahārāja Nanda; *sa*-*valayāḥ* — with bangles on their hands; *vrajatīḥ* — while going (in that costume); *virejuḥ* — they looked very, very beautiful; *vyālola* — moving; *kuṇḍala* — with earrings; *payodhara* — with breasts; *hāra* — with flower garlands; *śobhāḥ* — who appeared so beautiful.

### Translation

**In the ears of the gopīs were brilliantly polished jeweled earrings, and from their necks hung metal lockets. Their hands were decorated with bangles, their dresses were of varied colors, and from their hair, flowers fell onto the street like showers. Thus while going to the house of Mahārāja Nanda, the gopīs, their earrings, breasts and garlands moving, were brilliantly beautiful.**

### Purport

The description of the *gopīs,* who were going to the house of Mahārāja Nanda to welcome Kṛṣṇa, is especially significant. The *gopīs* were not ordinary women, but expansions of Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure potency, as described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.37,29):

*ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis  
tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ  
goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

(5.37)

*cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-  
lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam  
lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

(5.29)

Kṛṣṇa is always worshiped by the *gopīs* wherever He goes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is so vividly described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also described Kṛṣṇa in this way: *ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.* All these *gopīs* were going to offer Kṛṣṇa their presentations because the *gopīs* are eternal associates of the Lord. Now the *gopīs* were more jubilant because of the news of Kṛṣṇa’s appearance in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**Offering blessings to the newborn child, Kṛṣṇa, the wives and daughters of the cowherd men said, “May You become the King of Vraja and long maintain all its inhabitants.” They sprinkled a mixture of turmeric powder, oil and water upon the birthless Supreme Lord and offered their prayers.**

### Translation

### Purport

The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.” Whenever Kṛṣṇa comes, once in a day of Brahmā, He comes to the house of Nanda Mahārāja in Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa is the master of all creation (*sarva-loka-maheśvaram*). Therefore, not only in the neighborhood of Nanda Mahārāja’s estate, but all over the universe — and in all the other universes — musical sounds celebrated the auspicious arrival of the Lord.

### Translation

**In gladness, the cowherd men enjoyed the great festival by splashing one another’s bodies with a mixture of curd, condensed milk, butter and water. They threw butter on one another and smeared it on one another’s bodies.**

### Purport

From this statement we can understand that five thousand years ago not only was there enough milk, butter and curd to eat, drink and cook with, but when there was a festival it would be thrown about without restriction. There was no limit to how extensively milk, butter, curd and other such products were used in human society. Everyone had an ample stock of milk, and by using it in many varied milk preparations, people would keep good health in natural ways and thus enjoy life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Although it has become fashionable to speak of *daridra-nārāyaṇa,* the words *viṣṇor ārādhanārthāya* do not mean that all the people satisfied by Nanda Mahārāja in this great ceremony were Viṣṇus. They were not *daridra,* nor were they Nārāyaṇa. Rather, they were devotees of Nārāyaṇa, and by their educational qualifications they would satisfy Nārāyaṇa. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. *Mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā* (*Bhāg.* 11.19.21). The Lord says, “Worshiping My devotees is better than worshiping Me directly.” The *varṇāśrama* system is entirely meant for *viṣṇu-ārādhana,* worship of Lord Viṣṇu. *Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān/ viṣṇur ārādhyate* (*Viṣṇu Purāṇa* 3.8.9). The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord. The uncivilized man or materialistic person, however, does not know this aim of life. *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum* (*Bhāg.* 7.5.31). One’s real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. Not satisfying Lord Viṣṇu but instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (*bahir-artha-māninaḥ*) is the wrong way for happiness. Because Viṣṇu is the root of everything, if Viṣṇu is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one’s children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Mahārāja wanted to see his newborn child happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu, and to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu it was necessary to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned *brāhmaṇas, māgadhas* and *sūtas.* Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately it was Lord Viṣṇu who was to be satisfied.

रोहिणी च महाभागा नन्दगोपाभिनन्दिता ।

*rohiṇī ca mahā-bhāgā  
nanda-gopābhinanditā  
vyacarad divya-vāsa-srak-  
kaṇṭhābharaṇa-bhūṣitā*

### Synonyms

*rohiṇī* — Rohiṇī, the mother of Baladeva; *ca* — also; *mahā*-*bhāgā* — the most fortunate mother of Baladeva (greatly fortunate because of having the opportunity to raise Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma together); *nanda*-*gopā*-*abhinanditā* — being honored by Mahārāja Nanda and mother Yaśodā; *vyacarat* — was busy wandering here and there; *divya* — beautiful; *vāsa* — with a dress; *srak* — with a garland; *kaṇṭha*-*ābharaṇa* — and with an ornament covering the neck; *bhūṣitā* — decorated.

### Translation

**The most fortunate Rohiṇī, the mother of Baladeva, was honored by Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā, and thus she also dressed gorgeously and decorated herself with a necklace, a garland and other ornaments. She was busy wandering here and there to receive the women who were guests at the festival.**

### Purport

Rohiṇī, another wife of Vasudeva’s, was also kept under the care of Nanda Mahārāja with her son Baladeva. Because her husband was imprisoned by Kaṁsa, she was not very happy, but on the occasion of Kṛṣṇa-janmāṣṭamī, Nandotsava, when Nanda Mahārāja gave dresses and ornaments to others, he also gave gorgeous garments and ornaments to Rohiṇī so that she could take part in the festival. Thus she also was busy receiving the women who were guests. Because of her good fortune in being able to raise Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma together, she is described as *mahā-bhāgā,* greatly fortunate.

*tata ārabhya nandasya

### Synonyms

*tataḥ* *ārabhya* — beginning from that time; *nandasya* — of Mahārāja Nanda; *vrajaḥ* — Vrajabhūmi, the land for protecting and breeding cows; *sarva*-*samṛddhimān* — became opulent with all kinds of riches; *hareḥ* *nivāsa* — of the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *ātma*-*guṇaiḥ* — by the transcendental qualities; *ramā*-*ākrīḍam* — the place of pastimes for the goddess of fortune; *abhūt* — became; *nṛpa* — O King (Mahārāja Parīkṣit).

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the home of Nanda Mahārāja is eternally the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His transcendental qualities and is therefore always naturally endowed with the opulence of all wealth. Yet beginning from Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance there, it became the place for the pastimes of the goddess of fortune.**

### Purport

As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.29), *lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.* The abode of Kṛṣṇa is always served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Wherever Kṛṣṇa goes, the goddess of fortune naturally resides with Him. The chief of the goddesses of fortune is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa’s appearance in the land of Vraja indicated that the chief goddess of fortune, Rādhārāṇī, would also appear there very soon. Nanda Mahārāja’s abode was already opulent, and since Kṛṣṇa had appeared, it would be opulent in all respects.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Thereafter, my dear King Parīkṣit, O best protector of the Kuru dynasty, Nanda Mahārāja appointed the local cowherd men to protect Gokula and then went to Mathurā to pay the yearly taxes to King Kaṁsa.**

### Purport

Because the killing of babies was going on and had already become known, Nanda Mahārāja was very much afraid for his newborn child. Thus he appointed the local cowherd men to protect his home and child. He wanted to go immediately to Mathurā to pay the taxes due and also to offer some presentation for the sake of his newborn son. For the protection of the child, he had worshiped various demigods and forefathers and given charity to everyone’s satisfaction. Similarly, Nanda Mahārāja wanted not only to pay Kaṁsa the yearly taxes but also to offer some presentation so that Kaṁsa too would be satisfied. His only concern was how to protect his transcendental child, Kṛṣṇa.

*vasudeva upaśrutya  
bhrātaraṁ nandam āgatam

### Synonyms

*vasudevaḥ* — Vasudeva; *upaśrutya* — when he heard; *bhrātaram* — that his dear friend and brother; *nandam* — Nanda Mahārāja; *āgatam* — had come to Mathurā; *jñātvā* — when he learned; *datta*-*karam* — and had already paid the taxes; *rājñe* — unto the King; *yayau* — he went; *tat*-*avamocanam* — to the residential quarters of Nanda Mahārāja.

### Translation

**When Vasudeva heard that Nanda Mahārāja, his very dear friend and brother, had come to Mathurā and already paid the taxes to Kaṁsa, he went to Nanda Mahārāja’s residence.**

### Purport

Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja were so intimately connected that they lived like brothers. Furthermore, it is learned from the notes of Śrīpāda Madhvācārya that Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja were stepbrothers. Vasudeva’s father, Śūrasena, married a *vaiśya* girl, and from her Nanda Mahārāja was born. Later, Nanda Mahārāja himself married a *vaiśya* girl, Yaśodā. Therefore his family is celebrated as a *vaiśya* family, and Kṛṣṇa, identifying Himself as their son, took charge of *vaiśya* activities (*kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam*). Balarāma represents plowing the land for agriculture and therefore always carries in His hand a plow, whereas Kṛṣṇa tends cows and therefore carries a flute in His hand. Thus the two brothers represent *kṛṣi-rakṣya* and *go-rakṣya.*

### Purport

Nanda Mahārāja was older than Vasudeva. Therefore Nanda Mahārāja embraced him, and Vasudeva offered him *namaskāra.*

### Translation

**My dear brother Nanda Mahārāja, at an advanced age you had no son at all and were hopeless of having one. Therefore, that you now have a son is a sign of great fortune.**

### Purport

At an advanced age one generally cannot beget a male child. If by chance one does beget a child at this age, the child is generally female. Thus Vasudeva indirectly asked Nanda Mahārāja whether he had actually begotten a male child or a female child. Vasudeva knew that Yaśodā had given birth to a female child, whom he had stolen and replaced with a male child. This was a great mystery, and Vasudeva wanted to determine whether this mystery was already known to Nanda Mahārāja. On inquiring, however, he was confident that the mystery of Kṛṣṇa’s birth and His being placed in the care of Yaśodā was still hidden. There was no danger, since Kaṁsa at least could not learn what had already happened.

### Translation

**It is also by good fortune that I am seeing you. Having obtained this opportunity, I feel as if I have taken birth again. Even though one is present in this world, to meet with intimate friends and dear relatives in this material world is extremely difficult.**

### Purport

Vasudeva had been imprisoned by Kaṁsa, and therefore, although present in Mathurā, he was unable to see Nanda Mahārāja for many years. Therefore when they met again, Vasudeva considered this meeting to be another birth.

### Purport

Vasudeva was lamenting because he and Nanda Mahārāja could not live together. Yet how could they live together? Vasudeva warns that all of us, even if intimately related, are carried away by the waves of time according to the results of past *karma.*

### Translation

**My dear friend Nanda Mahārāja, in the place where you are living with your friends, is the forest favorable for the animals, the cows? I hope there is no disease or inconvenience. The place must be full of water, grass and other plants.**

### Purport

For human happiness, one must care for the animals, especially the cows. Vasudeva therefore inquired whether there was a good arrangement for the animals where Nanda Mahārāja lived. For the proper pursuit of human happiness, there must be arrangements for the protection of cows. This means that there must be forests and adequate pasturing grounds full of grass and water. If the animals are happy, there will be an ample supply of milk, from which human beings will benefit by deriving many milk products with which to live happily. As enjoined in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.44), *kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma-svabhāvajam.* Without giving proper facilities to the animals, how can human society be happy? That people are raising cattle to send to the slaughterhouse is a great sin. By this demoniac enterprise, people are ruining their chance for a truly human life. Because they are not giving any importance to the instructions of Kṛṣṇa, the advancement of their so-called civilization resembles the crazy efforts of men in a lunatic asylum.

When Vasudeva understood from Nanda Mahārāja that the mystery of Kṛṣṇa’s birth and His having been exchanged with Yaśodā’s daughter was yet undisclosed, he was happy that things were going on nicely. By saying that Vasudeva’s daughter, his youngest child, had gone to the heavenly planets, Nanda Mahārāja indicated that he did not know that this daughter was born of Yaśodā and that Vasudeva had exchanged her with Kṛṣṇa. Thus the doubts of Vasudeva were dispelled.
