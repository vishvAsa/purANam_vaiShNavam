CHAPTER TEN

This chapter describes how Kṛṣṇa broke the twin *arjuna* trees, from which Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva, the sons of Kuvera, then came out.

Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva were great devotees of Lord Śiva, but because of material opulence they became so extravagant and senseless that one day they were enjoying with naked girls in a lake and shamelessly walking here and there. Suddenly Nārada Muni passed by, but they were so maddened by their wealth and false prestige that even though they saw Nārada Muni present, they remained naked and were not even ashamed. In other words, because of opulence and false prestige, they lost their sense of common decency. Of course, it is the nature of the material qualities that when one becomes very much opulent in terms of wealth and a prestigious position, one loses one’s sense of etiquette and does not care about anyone, even a sage like Nārada Muni. For such bewildered persons (*ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā*), who especially deride devotees, the proper punishment is to be again stricken with poverty. The Vedic rules and regulations prescribe how to control the false sense of prestige by the practice of *yama, niyama* and so on (*tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena ca damena ca*). A poor man can be convinced very easily that the prestige of an opulent position in this material world is temporary, but a rich man cannot. Therefore Nārada Muni set an example by cursing these two persons, Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva, to become dull and unconscious like trees. This was a fit punishment. But because Kṛṣṇa is always merciful, even though they were punished they were fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Therefore the punishment given by Vaiṣṇavas is not at all punishment; rather, it is another kind of mercy. By the curse of the *devarṣi,* Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva became twin *arjuna* trees and remained in the courtyard of mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja, waiting for the opportunity to see Kṛṣṇa directly. Lord Kṛṣṇa, by the desire of His devotee, uprooted these *yamala-arjuna* trees, and when Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva were thus delivered by Kṛṣṇa after one hundred years of the *devas,* their old consciousness revived, and they offered Kṛṣṇa prayers suitable to be offered by demigods. Having thus gotten the opportunity to see Kṛṣṇa face to face, they understood how merciful Nārada Muni was, and therefore they expressed their indebtedness to him and thanked him. Then, after circumambulating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, they departed for their respective abodes.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied; *rudrasya* — of Lord Śiva; *anucarau* — two great devotees or associates; *bhūtvā* — being elevated to that post; *su*-*dṛptau* — being proud of that position and their beautiful bodily features; *dhanada*-*ātmajau* — the two sons of Kuvera, treasurer of the demigods; *kailāsa*-*upavane* — in a small garden attached to Kailāsa Parvata, the residence of Lord Śiva; *ramye* — in a very beautiful place; *mandākinyām* — on the river Mandākinī; *mada*-*utkaṭau* — terribly proud and mad; *vāruṇīm* — a kind of liquor named Vāruṇī; *madirām* — intoxication; *pītvā* — drinking; *mada*-*āghūrṇita*-*locanau* — their eyes rolling with intoxication; *strī*-*janaiḥ* — with women; *anugāyadbhiḥ* — vibrating songs sung by them; *ceratuḥ* — wandered; *puṣpite* *vane* — in a nice flower garden.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King Parīkṣit, because the two sons of Kuvera had been elevated to the association of Lord Śiva, of which they were very much proud, they were allowed to wander in a garden attached to Kailāsa Hill, on the bank of the Mandākinī River. Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called Vāruṇī. Accompanied by women singing after them, they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always rolling in intoxication.**

### Purport

This verse mentions some of the material advantages afforded to persons associated with or devoted to Lord Śiva. Apart from Lord Śiva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord Kṛṣṇa in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20): *kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ.* Those who are not devotees of Kṛṣṇa have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and therefore they have been described as *hṛta jñāna,* bereft of sense. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can very easily point out such foolish persons, for they have been indicated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15), where Lord Kṛṣṇa says:

*na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ  
prapadyante narādhamāḥ  
māyayāpahṛta-jñānā  
āsuraṁ bhāvaṁ āśritāḥ*

“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.” Anyone who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa and does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa must be considered *narādhama,* the lowest of men, and *duṣkṛtī,* one who always commits sinful activities. Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-class or fourth-class man, for one’s position can be understood simply by this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa?

Why are devotees of the demigods greater in number than the Vaiṣṇavas? The answer is given herein. Vaiṣṇavas are not interested in such fourth-class pleasures as wine and women, nor does Kṛṣṇa allow them such facilities.

### Verse text

*antaḥ praviśya gaṅgāyām

gajāv iva kareṇubhiḥ*

### Synonyms

*antaḥ* — within; *praviśya* — entering; *gaṅgāyām* — the Ganges, known as Mandākinī; *ambhoja* — of lotus flowers; *vana*-*rājini* — where there was a congested forest; *cikrīḍatuḥ* — the two of them used to enjoy; *yuvatibhiḥ* — in the company of young girls; *gajau* — two elephants; *iva* — just like; *kareṇubhiḥ* — with female elephants.

### Translation

**Within the waters of the Mandākinī Ganges, which were crowded with gardens of lotus flowers, the two sons of Kuvera would enjoy young girls, just like two male elephants enjoying in the water with female elephants.**

### Purport

People generally go to the Ganges to be purified of the effects of sinful life, but here is an example of how foolish persons enter the Ganges to become involved in sinful life. It is not that everyone becomes purified by entering the Ganges. Everything, spiritual and material, depends on one’s mental condition.

*yadṛcchayā* — by chance, while wandering all over the universe; *ca* — and; *deva*-*ṛṣiḥ* — the supreme saintly person among the demigods; *bhagavān* — the most powerful; *tatra* — there (where the two sons of Kuvera were enjoying life); *kaurava* — O Mahārāja Parīkṣit; *apaśyat* — when he saw; *nāradaḥ* — the great saint; *devau* — the two boys of the demigods; *kṣībāṇau* — with eyes maddened by intoxication; *samabudhyata* — he could understand (their position).

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, by some auspicious opportunity for the two boys, the great saint Devarṣi Nārada once appeared there by chance. Seeing them intoxicated, with rolling eyes, he could understand their situation.**

### Purport

It is said:

*‘sādhu-saṅga,’ ‘sādhu-saṅga’ — sarva-śāstre kaya  
lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya*

(Cc. *Madhya* 22.54)

Wherever Nārada Muni goes, any moment at which he appears is understood to be extremely auspicious. It is also said:

*brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva  
guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja*

“According to their *karma,* all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of both Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service.” (Cc. *Madhya* 19.151) Nārada appeared in the garden to give the two sons of Kuvera the seed of devotional service, even though they were intoxicated. Saintly persons know how to bestow mercy upon the fallen souls.

vivastrāḥ śāpa-śaṅkitāḥ  
vāsāṁsi paryadhuḥ śīghraṁ

### Translation

**Upon seeing Nārada, the naked young girls of the demigods were very much ashamed. Afraid of being cursed, they covered their bodies with their garments. But the two sons of Kuvera did not do so; instead, not caring about Nārada, they remained naked.**

तौ द‍ृष्ट्वा मदिरामत्तौ श्रीमदान्धौ सुरात्मजौ ।

### Verse text

*tau dṛṣṭvā madirā-mattau  
śrī-madāndhau surātmajau  
tayor anugrahārthāya  
śāpaṁ dāsyann idaṁ jagau*

### Synonyms

*tau* — the two boys of the demigods; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *madirā*-*mattau* — very intoxicated because of drinking liquor; *śrī*-*mada*-*andhau* — being blind with false prestige and opulence; *sura*-*ātmajau* — the two sons of the demigods; *tayoḥ* — unto them; *anugraha*-*arthāya* — for the purpose of giving special mercy; *śāpam* — a curse; *dāsyan* — desiring to offer them; *idam* — this; *jagau* — uttered.

### Translation

**Seeing the two sons of the demigods naked and intoxicated by opulence and false prestige, Devarṣi Nārada, in order to show them special mercy, desired to give them a special curse. Thus he spoke as follows.**

### Purport

Although in the beginning Nārada Muni appeared very angry and cursed them, at the end the two demigods Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva were able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, face to face. Thus the curse was ultimately auspicious and brilliant. One has to judge what kind of curse Nārada placed upon them. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives herein a good example. When a father finds his child deeply asleep but the child has to take some medicine to cure some disease, the father pinches the child so that the child will get up and take the medicine. In a similar way, Nārada Muni cursed Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva in order to cure their disease of material blindness.

*na hy anyo juṣato joṣyān

śrī-madād ābhijātyādir

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*nāradaḥ* *uvāca* — Nārada Muni said; *na* — there is not; *hi* — indeed; *anyaḥ* — another material enjoyment; *juṣataḥ* — of one who is enjoying; *joṣyān* — things very attractive in the material world (different varieties of eating, sleeping, mating and defense); *buddhi*-*bhraṁśaḥ* — such enjoyments attract the intelligence; *rajaḥ*-*guṇaḥ* — being controlled by the mode of passion; *śrī*-*madāt* — than riches; *ābhijātya*-*ādiḥ* — among the four material principles (attractive personal bodily features, birth in an aristocratic family, being very learned, and being very rich); *yatra* — wherein; *strī* — women; *dyūtam* — gambling; *āsavaḥ* — wine (wine, women and gambling are very prominent).

### Translation

**Nārada Muni said: Among all the attractions of material enjoyment, the attraction of riches bewilders one’s intelligence more than having beautiful bodily features, taking birth in an aristocratic family, and being learned. When one is uneducated but falsely puffed up by wealth, the result is that one engages his wealth in enjoying wine, women and gambling.**

### Purport

Among the three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — people are certainly conducted by the lower qualities, namely passion and ignorance, and especially by passion. Conducted by the mode of passion, one becomes more and more involved in material existence. Therefore human life is meant for subduing the modes of passion and ignorance and advancing in the mode of goodness.

*tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ  
kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye  
ceta etair anāviddhaṁ  
sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati*

(*Bhāg.* 1.2.19)

This is culture: one must subdue the modes of passion and ignorance. In the mode of passion, when one is falsely proud of wealth, one engages his wealth only for three things, namely wine, women and gambling. We can actually see, especially in this age, that those who have unnecessary riches simply try to enjoy these three things. In Western civilization, these three things are very prominent because of an unnecessary increase of wealth. Nārada Muni considered all this in the case of Maṇigrīva and Nalakūvara because he found in them so much pride in the wealth of their father, Kuvera.

हन्यन्ते पशवो यत्र निर्दयैरजितात्मभि- ।

### Verse text

*hanyante paśavo yatra  
nirdayair ajitātmabhiḥ  
manyamānair imaṁ deham  
ajarāmṛtyu naśvaram*

### Synonyms

*hanyante* — are killed in many ways (especially by slaughterhouses); *paśavaḥ* — four-legged animals (horses, sheep, cows, hogs, etc.); *yatra* — wherein; *nirdayaiḥ* — by those merciless persons who are conducted by the mode of passion; *ajita*-*ātmabhiḥ* — rascals who are unable to control the senses; *manyamānaiḥ* — are thinking; *imam* — this; *deham* — body; *ajara* — will never become old or diseased; *amṛtyu* — death will never come; *naśvaram* — although the body is destined to be annihilated.

### Translation

**Unable to control their senses, rascals who are falsely proud of their riches or their birth in aristocratic families are so cruel that to maintain their perishable bodies, which they think will never grow old or die, they kill poor animals without mercy. Sometimes they kill animals merely to enjoy an excursion.**

### Purport

When the modes of passion and ignorance increase in human society, giving rise to unnecessary economic development, the result is that people become involved with wine, women and gambling. Then, being mad, they maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however one may try to maintain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease, such foolish rascals engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being *duṣkṛtīs,* they completely forget the existence of the supreme controller, who is sitting within the core of everyone’s heart (*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati*). That supreme controller is observing every bit of one’s activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by giving one a suitable body made by material nature (*bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā*). In this way, sinful persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth will be finished with his next birth.

*na sādhu manye yata ātmano ’yam  
asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ*

(*Bhāg.* 5.5.4)

Animal killing is prohibited. Every living being, of course, has to eat something (*jīvo jīvasya jīvanam*). But one should be taught what kind of food one should take. Therefore the *Īśopaniṣad* instructs, *tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ:* one should eat whatever is allotted for human beings. Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26):

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ  
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam  
aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.” A devotee, therefore, does not eat anything that would require slaughterhouses for poor animals. Rather, devotees take *prasāda* of Kṛṣṇa (*tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ*). Kṛṣṇa recommends that one give Him *patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam* — a leaf, a flower, fruit or water. Animal food is never recommended for human beings; instead, a human being is recommended to take *prasāda,* remnants of food left by Kṛṣṇa. *Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ* (Bg. 3.13). If one practices eating *prasāda,* even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one becomes free from the results of sinful acts.

*deva-saṁjñitam apy ante  
kṛmi-viḍ-bhasma-saṁjñitam  
bhūta-dhruk tat-kṛte svārthaṁ  
kiṁ veda nirayo yataḥ*

### Synonyms

*deva*-*saṁjñitam* — the body now known as a very exalted person, like president, minister or even demigod; *api* — even if the body is so exalted; *ante* — after death; *kṛmi* — turns into worms; *viṭ* — or into stool; *bhasma*-*saṁjñitam* — or into ashes; *bhūta*-*dhruk* — a person who does not accept the śāstric injunctions and is unnecessarily envious of other living entities; *tat*-*kṛte* — by acting in that way; *sva*-*artham* — self-interest; *kim* — who is there; *veda* — who knows; *nirayaḥ* *yataḥ* — because from such sinful activities one must suffer hellish conditions.

### Translation

**While living one may be proud of one’s body, thinking oneself a very big man, minister, president or even demigod, but whatever one may be, after death this body will turn either into worms, into stool or into ashes. If one kills poor animals to satisfy the temporary whims of this body, one does not know that he will suffer in his next birth, for such a sinful miscreant must go to hell and suffer the results of his actions.**

### Purport

In this verse the three words *kṛmi-vid-bhasma* are significant. After death, the body may become *kṛmi,* which means “worms,” for if the body is disposed of without cremation, it may be eaten by worms; or else it may be eaten by animals like hogs and vultures and be turned into stool. Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and thus it becomes ashes (*bhasma-saṁjñitam*). Yet although the body will be turned into worms, stool or ashes, foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of body is actually meant for *jīvasya tattva jijñāsā,* enlightenment in knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, one must seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. *Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta:* one must approach a *guru.* Who is a *guru*? *Śābde pare ca niṣṇātam* (*Bhāg.* 11.3.21): a *guru* is one who has full transcendental knowledge. Unless one approaches a spiritual master, one remains in ignorance. *Ācāryavān puruṣo veda* (*Chāndogya Upaniṣad* 6.14.2): one has full knowledge about life when one is *ācāryavān,* controlled by the *ācārya.* But when one is conducted by *rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa,* one does not care about anything; instead, one acts like an ordinary foolish animal, risking his life (*mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani*) and therefore continuing to go through suffering after suffering. *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum* (*Bhāg.* 7.5.31). Such a foolish person does not know how to elevate himself in this body. Instead, he indulges in sinful activities and goes deeper and deeper into hellish life.

### Synonyms

*dehaḥ* — this body; *kim* *anna*-*dātuḥ* — does it belong to the employer who gives me the money to maintain it; *svam* — or does it belong to me personally; *niṣektuḥ* — (or does it belong) to the person who discharged the semen; *mātuḥ* *eva* — (or does it belong) to the mother who maintained this body within her womb; *ca* — and; *mātuḥ* *pituḥ* *vā* — or (does it belong) to the father of the mother (because sometimes the father of the mother takes a grandson as an adopted son); *balinaḥ* — (or does it belong) to the person who takes this body away by force; *kretuḥ* — or to the person who purchases the body as a slave; *agneḥ* — or to the fire (because ultimately the body is burned); *śunaḥ* — or to the dogs and vultures that ultimately eat it; *api* — even; *vā* — or.

### Translation

**While alive, does this body belong to its employer, to the self, to the father, the mother, or the mother’s father? Does it belong to the person who takes it away by force, to the slave master who purchases it, or to the sons who burn it in the fire? Or, if the body is not burned, does it belong to the dogs that eat it? Among the many possible claimants, who is the rightful claimant? Not to ascertain this but instead to maintain the body by sinful activities is not good.**

*evam* — in this way; *sādhāraṇam* — common property; *deham* — the body; *avyakta* — from unmanifested nature; *prabhava* — manifested in that way; *apyayam* — and again merged with the unmanifested (“for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return”); *kaḥ* — who is that person; *vidvān* — one who is actually in knowledge; *ātmasāt* *kṛtvā* — claiming as his own; *hanti* — kills; *jantūn* — poor animals; *ṛte* — except; *asataḥ* — rascals who have no knowledge, no clear understanding.

### Translation

**This body, after all, is produced by the unmanifested nature and again annihilated and merged in the natural elements. Therefore, it is the common property of everyone. Under the circumstances, who but a rascal claims this property as his own and while maintaining it commits such sinful activities as killing animals just to satisfy his whims? Unless one is a rascal, one cannot commit such sinful activities.**

### Purport

Atheists do not believe in the existence of the soul. Nonetheless, unless one is very cruel, why should one kill animals unnecessarily? The body is a manifestation of a combination of matter. In the beginning it was nothing, but by a combination of matter it has come into existence. Then again, when the combination is dismantled, the body will no longer exist. In the beginning it was nothing, and in the end it will be nothing. Why then should one commit sinful activities when it is manifested? It is not possible for anyone to do this unless he is rascal number one.

### Synonyms

*asataḥ* — of such a foolish rascal; *śrī*-*mada*-*andhasya* — who is blinded by temporarily possessing riches and opulence; *dāridryam* — poverty; *param* *añjanam* — the best ointment for the eyes, by which to see things as they are; *ātma*-*aupamyena* — with comparison to himself; *bhūtāni* — living beings; *daridraḥ* — a poverty-stricken man; *param* — perfectly; *īkṣate* — can see things as they are.

### Translation

**Atheistic fools and rascals who are very much proud of wealth fail to see things as they are. Therefore, returning them to poverty is the proper ointment for their eyes so they may see things as they are. At least a poverty-stricken man can realize how painful poverty is, and therefore he will not want others to be in a painful condition like his own.**

### Purport

Even today, if a man who was formerly poverty-stricken gets money, he is inclined to utilize his money to perform many philanthropic activities, like opening schools for uneducated men and hospitals for the diseased. In this connection there is an instructive story called *punar mūṣiko bhava,* “Again Become a Mouse.” A mouse was very much harassed by a cat, and therefore the mouse approached a saintly person to request to become a cat. When the mouse became a cat, he was harassed by a dog, and then when he became a dog, he was harassed by a tiger. But when he became a tiger, he stared at the saintly person, and when the saintly person asked him, “What do you want?” the tiger said, “I want to eat you.” Then the saintly person cursed him, saying, “May you again become a mouse.” A similar thing is going on all over the universe. One is going up and down, sometimes becoming a mouse, sometimes a tiger, and so on. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said:

*brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva  
guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja*

(Cc. *Madhya* 19.151)

The living entities are promoted and degraded by the laws of nature, but if one is very, very fortunate, by association with saintly persons he gets the seed of devotional service, and his life becomes successful. Nārada Muni wanted to bring Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva to the platform of devotional service through poverty, and thus he cursed them. Such is the mercy of a Vaiṣṇava. Unless one is brought to the Vaiṣṇava platform, one cannot be a good man. *Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ* (*Bhāg.* 5.18.12). An *avaiṣṇava* never becomes a good man, however severely he is punished.

यथा कण्टकविद्धाङ्गो जन्तोर्नेच्छति तां व्यथाम् ।  
जीवसाम्यं गतो लिङ्गैर्न तथाविद्धकण्टक- ॥ १४ ॥

*yathā kaṇṭaka-viddhāṅgo  
jantor necchati tāṁ vyathām  
jīva-sāmyaṁ gato liṅgair  
na tathāviddha-kaṇṭakaḥ*

### Synonyms

*yathā* — just as; *kaṇṭaka*-*viddha*-*aṅgaḥ* — a person whose body has been pinpricked; *jantoḥ* — of such an animal; *na* — not; *icchati* — desires; *tām* — a particular; *vyathām* — pain; *jīva*-*sāmyam* *gataḥ* — when he understands that the position is the same for everyone; *liṅgaiḥ* — by possessing a particular type of body; *na* — not; *tathā* — so; *aviddha*-*kaṇṭakaḥ* — a person who has not been pinpricked.

### Translation

**By seeing their faces, one whose body has been pricked by pins can understand the pain of others who are pinpricked. Realizing that this pain is the same for everyone, he does not want others to suffer in this way. But one who has never been pricked by pins cannot understand this pain.**

### Purport

There is a saying, “The happiness of wealth is enjoyable by a person who has tasted the distress of poverty.” There is also another common saying, *vandhyā ki bujhibe prasava-vedanā:* “A woman who has not given birth to a child cannot understand the pain of childbirth.” Unless one comes to the platform of actual experience, one cannot realize what is pain and what is happiness in this material world. The laws of nature act accordingly. If one has killed an animal, one must himself be killed by that same animal. This is called *māṁsa.* *Mām* means “me,” and *sa* means “he.” As I am eating an animal, that animal will have the opportunity to eat me. In every state, therefore, it is ordinarily the custom that if a person commits murder he is hanged.

*daridro nirahaṁ-stambho  
muktaḥ sarva-madair iha  
kṛcchraṁ yadṛcchayāpnoti  
tad dhi tasya paraṁ tapaḥ*

### Synonyms

*daridraḥ* — a poverty-stricken person; *nir*-*aham*-*stambhaḥ* — is automatically freed from all false prestige; *muktaḥ* — liberated; *sarva* — all; *madaiḥ* — from false ego; *iha* — in this world; *kṛcchram* — with great difficulty; *yadṛcchayā* *āpnoti* — what he gains by chance from providence; *tat* — that; *hi* — indeed; *tasya* — his; *param* — perfect; *tapaḥ* — austerity.

### Translation

**A poverty-stricken man must automatically undergo austerities and penances because he does not have the wealth to possess anything. Thus his false prestige is vanquished. Always in need of food, shelter and clothing, he must be satisfied with what is obtained by the mercy of providence. Undergoing such compulsory austerities is good for him because this purifies him and completely frees him from false ego.**

### Purport

A saintly person voluntarily accepts a state of poverty just to become free from material false prestige. Many great kings left their princely standard of living and went to the forest to practice austerity according to Vedic culture, just to become purified. But if one who cannot voluntarily accept such austerity is put into a situation of poverty, he automatically must practice austerity. Austerity is good for everyone because it frees one from material conditions. Therefore, if one is very much proud of his material position, putting him into poverty is the best way to rectify his foolishness. *Dāridrya-doṣo guṇa-rāśi-nāśi:* when a person is poverty-stricken, naturally his false pride in aristocracy, wealth, education and beauty is smashed. Thus corrected, he is in the right position for liberation.

*nityam* — always; *kṣut* — with hunger; *kṣāma* — weak, without necessary strength; *dehasya* — of the body of a poor man; *daridrasya* — poverty-stricken; *anna*-*kāṅkṣiṇaḥ* — always desiring to get sufficient food; *indriyāṇi* — the senses, which are compared to snakes; *anuśuṣyanti* — gradually become weaker and weaker, with less potency; *hiṁsā* *api* — the tendency to be envious of others; *vinivartate* — reduces.

### Translation

**Always hungry, longing for sufficient food, a poverty-stricken man gradually becomes weaker and weaker. Having no extra potency, his senses are automatically pacified. A poverty-stricken man, therefore, is unable to perform harmful, envious activities. In other words, such a man automatically gains the results of the austerities and penances adopted voluntarily by saintly persons.**

### Purport

According to the opinion of experienced medical practitioners, diabetes is a result of voracious eating, and tuberculosis is a disease of undereating. We should desire neither to be diabetic nor to be tubercular. *Yāvad artha-prayojanam.* We should eat frugally and keep the body fit for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As recommended elsewhere in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.10):

*kāmasya nendriya-prītir  
lābho jīveta yāvatā  
jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā  
nārtho yaś ceha karmabhiḥ*

The real business of human life is to keep oneself fit for advancement in spiritual realization. Human life is not meant for making the senses unnecessarily strong so that one suffers from disease and one increases in an envious, fighting spirit. In this Age of Kali, however, human civilization is so misled that people are unnecessarily increasing in economic development, and as a result they are opening more and more slaughterhouses, liquor shops and brothels. In this way, the whole civilization is being spoiled.

### Synonyms

*daridrasya* — of a person who is poverty-stricken; *eva* — indeed; *yujyante* — may easily associate; *sādhavaḥ* — saintly persons; *sama*-*darśinaḥ* — although *sādhus* are equal to everyone, to the poor and the rich, the poor man can take advantage of their association; *sadbhiḥ* — by the association of such saintly persons; *kṣiṇoti* — reduces; *tam* — the original cause of material suffering; *tarṣam* — the desire for material enjoyment; *tataḥ* — thereafter; *ārāt* — very soon; *viśuddhyati* — his material contamination is cleansed off.

### Translation

**Saintly persons may freely associate with those who are poverty-stricken, but not with those who are rich. A poverty-stricken man, by association with saintly persons, very soon becomes uninterested in material desires, and the dirty things within the core of his heart are cleansed away.**

### Purport

It is said, *mahad-vicalanaṁ nṝṇāṁ gṛhiṇāṁ dīna-cetasām* (*Bhāg.* 10.8.4). The only business of a saintly person or *sannyāsī,* a person in the renounced order, is to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. *Sādhus,* saintly persons, want to preach to both the poor and the rich, but the poor take more advantage of the *sādhus’* preaching than the rich do. A poor man receives *sādhus* very quickly, offers them obeisances, and tries to take advantage of their presence, whereas a rich man keeps a big greyhound dog at his door so that no one can enter his house. He posts a sign saying “Beware of Dog” and avoids the association of saintly persons, whereas a poor man keeps his door open for them and thus benefits by their association more than a rich man does. Because Nārada Muni, in his previous life, was the poverty-stricken son of a maidservant, he got the association of saintly persons and later became the exalted Nārada Muni. This was his actual experience. Therefore, he is now comparing the position of a poor man with that of a rich man.

*satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido  
bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ  
taj-joṣaṇād āśv apavarga-vartmani  
śraddhā ratir bhaktir anukramiṣyati*

(*Bhāg.* 3.25.25)

If one gets the advantage of association with saintly persons, by their instructions one becomes more and more purified of material desires.

*kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha haiyā bhoga-vāñchā kare  
nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare*

(*Prema-vivarta*)

Material life means that one forgets Kṛṣṇa and that one increases in one’s desires for sense gratification. But if one receives the advantage of instructions from saintly persons and forgets the importance of material desires, one is automatically purified. *Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam* (*Śikṣāṣṭaka* 1). Unless the core of a materialistic person’s heart is purified, he cannot get rid of the pangs of *bhava-mahā-dāvāgni,* the blazing fire of material existence.

### Translation

**Saintly persons \[sādhus\] think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours a day. They have no other interest. Why should people neglect the association of such exalted spiritual personalities and try to associate with materialists, taking shelter of nondevotees, most of whom are proud and rich?**

### Purport

A *sādhu* is one who is engaged in devotional service to the Lord without deviation (*bhajate mām ananya-bhāk*).

*titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ  
suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām  
ajāta-śatravaḥ śāntāḥ  
sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇāḥ*

“The symptoms of a *sādhu* are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.” (*Bhāg.* 3.25.21) A *sādhu* is *suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām,* the friend of everyone. Why then should the rich, instead of associating with *sādhus,* waste their valuable time in association with other rich men who are averse to spiritual life? Both the poor man and the rich man can take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and here it is advised that everyone do so. There is no profit in avoiding the association of the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said:

*sat-saṅga chāḍi’ kainu asate vilāsa  
te-kāraṇe lāgila ye karma-bandha-phāṅsa*

If we give up the association of *sādhus,* saintly persons engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and associate with persons seeking sense gratification and accumulating wealth for this purpose, our life is spoiled. The word *asat* refers to an *avaiṣṇava,* one who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and *sat* refers to a Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇa’s devotee. One should always seek the association of Vaiṣṇavas and not spoil one’s life by mixing with *avaiṣṇavas.* In *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15), the distinction between Vaiṣṇava and *avaiṣṇava* is enunciated:

*na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ  
prapadyante narādhamāḥ  
māyayāpahṛta-jñānā  
āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ*

Anyone who is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa is a most sinful person (*duṣkṛtī*), a rascal (*mūḍha*), and the lowest of men (*narādhama*). Therefore one should not avoid the association of Vaiṣṇavas, which is now available all over the world in the form of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

### Translation

**Therefore, since these two persons, drunk with the liquor named Vāruṇī, or Mādhvī, and unable to control their senses, have been blinded by the pride of celestial opulence and have become attached to women, I shall relieve them of their false prestige.**

### Purport

When a *sādhu* chastises or punishes someone, he does not do so for revenge. Mahārāja Parīkṣit had inquired why Nārada Muni was subject to such a spirit of revenge (*tamaḥ*). But this was not *tamaḥ,* for Nārada Muni, in full knowledge of what was for the good of the two brothers, wisely thought of how to cure them. Vaiṣṇavas are good physicians. They know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never in *tamo-guṇa.* *Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate* (Bg. 14.26). Vaiṣṇavas are always situated on the transcendental platform, the Brahman platform. They cannot be subject to mistakes or the influence of the modes of material nature. Whatever they do, after full consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to Godhead.

### Translation

**These two young men, Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva, are by fortune the sons of the great demigod Kuvera, but because of false prestige and madness after drinking liquor, they are so fallen that they are naked but cannot understand that they are. Therefore, because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not conscious), these two young men should receive the bodies of trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they become trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have remembrance of their past sinful activities. Moreover, by my special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the measurement of the demigods, they will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, face to face, and thus revive their real position as devotees.**

### Purport

A tree has no consciousness: when cut, it feels no pain. But Nārada Muni wanted the consciousness of Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva to continue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would not forget the circumstances under which they had been punished. Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, Nārada Muni arranged things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana and thus revive their dormant *bhakti.*

Each day of the demigods in the upper planetary system equals six months of our measurement. Although the demigods in the upper planetary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees, and therefore they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons, namely the *devas* and the *asuras.* *Asuras* forget their relationship with Kṛṣṇa (*āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ*), whereas the *devas* do not forget.

*dvau bhūta-sargau loke ’smin  
daiva āsura eva ca  
viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daiva  
āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ*

(*Padma Purāṇa*)

The distinction between a pure devotee and a *karma-miśra* devotee is this: a pure devotee does not desire anything for material enjoyment, whereas a mixed devotee becomes a devotee to become a first-class enjoyer of this material world. One who is in direct touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains pure, uncontaminated by material desires (*anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam*).

By *karma-miśra-bhakti* one is elevated to the celestial kingdom, by *jñāna-miśra-bhakti* one is able to merge in the Brahman effulgence, and by *yoga-miśra-bhakti* one is able to realize the omnipotency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But pure *bhakti* does not depend on *karma, jñāna* or *yoga,* for it simply consists of loving affairs. The liberation of the *bhakta,* therefore, which is called not just *mukti* but *vimukti,* surpasses the five other kinds of liberation — *sāyujya, sārūpya, sālokya, sārṣṭi* and *sāmīpya.* A pure devotee always engages in pure service (*ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*). Taking birth in the upper planetary system as a demigod is a chance to become a further purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. Nārada Muni indirectly gave Maṇigrīva and Nalakūvara the greatest opportunity by his so-called curse.

### Translation

**“Although these two young men are the sons of the very rich Kuvera and I have nothing to do with them, Devarṣi Nārada is My very dear and affectionate devotee, and therefore because he wanted Me to come face to face with them, I must do so for their deliverance.”**

### Purport

Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva actually had nothing to do with devotional service or seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, for this is not an ordinary opportunity. It is not that because one is very rich or learned or was born in an aristocratic family one will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is impossible. But in this case, because Nārada Muni desired that Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva see Vāsudeva face to face, the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to fulfill the words of His very dear devotee Nārada Muni. If one seeks the favor of a devotee instead of directly asking favors from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is very easily successful. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has therefore recommended: *vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukkura bhuliyā jānaha more, kṛṣṇa se tomāra kṛṣṇa dite pāra.* One should desire to become like a dog in strictly following a devotee. Kṛṣṇa is in the hand of a devotee. *Adurlabham ātma-bhaktau*. Thus without the favor of a devotee, one cannot directly approach Kṛṣṇa, what to speak of engaging in His service. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore sings, *chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:* unless one becomes a servant of a pure devotee, one cannot be delivered from the material condition of life. In our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava society, following in the footsteps of Rūpa Gosvāmī, our first business is to seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master (*ādau gurv-āśrayaḥ*).

Learned brāhmaṇas know \[on the basis of the Vedic statement sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma\] that You are everything and that this cosmic manifestation, in its gross and subtle aspects, is Your form.**

### Purport

The two demigods Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva, because of their continuing memory, could understand the supremacy of Kṛṣṇa by the grace of Nārada. Now they admitted, “That we should be delivered by the blessings of Nārada Muni was all Your plan. Therefore You are the supreme mystic. Everything — past, present and future — is known to You. Your plan was made so nicely that although we stayed here as twin *arjuna* trees, You have appeared as a small boy to deliver us. This was all Your inconceivable arrangement. Because You are the Supreme Person, You can do everything.”

You are the Supersoul, and therefore You know everything within the core of the heart of every living entity.**

vikāraiḥ prākṛtair guṇaiḥ  
ko nv ihārhati vijñātuṁ

### Synonyms

*gṛhyamāṇaiḥ* — accepting the body made of material nature as existing at the present moment because of being visible; *tvam* — You; *agrāhyaḥ* — not confined in a body made of material nature; *vikāraiḥ* — agitated by the mind; *prākṛtaiḥ* *guṇaiḥ* — by the material modes of nature (*sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa*); *kaḥ* — who is there; *nu* — after that; *iha* — in this material world; *arhati* — who deserves; *vijñātum* — to know; *prāk* *siddham* — that which existed before the creation; *guṇa*-*saṁvṛtaḥ* — because of being covered by the material qualities.

### Translation

**O Lord, You exist before the creation. Therefore, who, trapped by a body of material qualities in this material world, can understand You?**

### Purport

As it is said:

*ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi  
na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ  
sevonmukhe hi jihvādau  
svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ*

(*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.234)

Kṛṣṇa’s name, attributes and form are Absolute Truth, existing before the creation. Therefore, how can those who are created — that is, those entrapped in bodies created of material elements — understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly? This is not possible. But, *sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:* Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself to those engaged in devotional service. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.55) by the Lord Himself: *bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.* Even the descriptions of Kṛṣṇa in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional activities. The more one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him as He is. If from the material platform one could understand Kṛṣṇa, then, since Kṛṣṇa is everything (*sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma*), one could understand Kṛṣṇa by seeing anything within this material world. But that is not possible.

*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ  
jagad avyakta-mūrtinā  
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni  
na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*

(Bg. 9.4)

Everything is resting on Kṛṣṇa, and everything is Kṛṣṇa, but this is not to be realized by persons on the material platform.

*tasmai tubhyaṁ bhagavate

### Synonyms

*tasmai* — (because You are not to be understood from the material platform, we simply offer obeisances) unto Him; *tubhyam* — unto You; *bhagavate* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *vāsudevāya* — unto Vāsudeva, the origin of Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha; *vedhase* — unto the origin of creation; *ātma*-*dyota*-*guṇaiḥ* *channa*-*mahimne* — unto You whose glories are covered by Your personal energy; *brahmaṇe* — unto the Supreme Brahman; *namaḥ* — our respectful obeisances.

### Translation

**O Lord, whose glories are covered by Your own energy, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You are Saṅkarṣaṇa, the origin of creation, and You are Vāsudeva, the origin of the caturvyūha. Because You are everything and are therefore the Supreme Brahman, we simply offer our respectful obeisances unto You.**

### Purport

Instead of trying to understand Kṛṣṇa in detail, it is better to offer our respectful obeisances unto Him, for He is the origin of everything and He is everything. Because we are covered by the material modes of nature, He is very difficult for us to understand unless He reveals Himself to us. Therefore it is better for us to acknowledge that He is everything and offer obeisances unto His lotus feet.

### Translation

**Appearing in bodies like those of an ordinary fish, tortoise and hog, You exhibit activities impossible for such creatures to perform — extraordinary, incomparable, transcendental activities of unlimited power and strength. These bodies of Yours, therefore, are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your Supreme Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the benefit of all living entities within this material world.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7-8):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ  
vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya  
sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

Kṛṣṇa appears as an incarnation when real spiritual life declines and when rogues and thieves increase to disturb the situation of the world. Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot understand the Lord’s activities, and therefore such persons describe these activities as *kalpanā* — mythology or imagination — because they are rascals and the lowest of men (*na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ*). Such men cannot understand that the events described by Vyāsadeva in the *Purāṇas* and other *śāstras* are not fictitious or imaginary, but factual.

Kṛṣṇa, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although the two trees were so large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Kṛṣṇa, as a child, exhibited such extraordinary strength that they fell down with a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Pūtanā, Śakaṭāsura and Tṛṇāvartāsura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the entire universe within His mouth, Kṛṣṇa proved that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (*mūḍhas*), because of sinful activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is different from that of a nondevotee.

### Synonyms

*namaḥ* — we therefore offer our respectful obeisances; *parama*-*kalyāṇa* — You are the supreme auspiciousness; *namaḥ* — our respectful obeisances unto You; *parama*-*maṅgala* — whatever You do is good; *vāsudevāya* — unto the original Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva; *śāntāya* — unto the most peaceful; *yadūnām* — of the Yadu dynasty; *pataye* — unto the controller; *namaḥ* — our respectful obeisances unto You.

### Translation

**O supremely auspicious, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You, who are the supreme good. O most famous descendant and controller of the Yadu dynasty, O son of Vasudeva, O most peaceful, let us offer our obeisances unto Your lotus feet.**

### Purport

The word *parama-kalyāṇa* is significant because Kṛṣṇa, in any of His incarnations, appears in order to protect the *sādhus* (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnām*). The *sādhus,* saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed by nondevotees, and Kṛṣṇa appears in His incarnations to give them relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Kṛṣṇa’s life, we shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing demons one after another.

### Translation

**O supreme form, we are always servants of Your servants, especially of Nārada Muni. Now give us permission to leave for our home. It is by the grace and mercy of Nārada Muni that we have been able to see You face to face.**

### Purport

Unless delivered or blessed by a devotee, one cannot realize that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.* According to this verse of *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.3), there are so many *siddhas* or *yogīs* who cannot understand Kṛṣṇa; instead, they misunderstand Him. But if one takes shelter of a devotee descending from the *paramparā* system of Nārada (*svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ*), one can then understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations are advertised simply for having exhibited some magical performances, but except for persons who are servants of Nārada and other servants of Kṛṣṇa, no one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. *Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:* no one is delivered from the material conception of life unless favored by a Vaiṣṇava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by any other bodily or mental gymnastics.

May our heads offer our obeisances to everything within this world, because all things are also Your different forms, and may our eyes see the forms of Vaiṣṇavas, who are nondifferent from You.**

### Purport

Here the process of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is given. This process is *bhakti.*

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ  
smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ  
sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

(*Bhāg.* 7.5.23)

Everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. *Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate* (*Nārada-pañcarātra*). Everything — the mind, the body and all the sense organs — should be engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service. This is to be learned from expert devotees like Nārada, Svayambhū and Śambhu. This is the process. We cannot manufacture our own way of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is not that everything one manufactures or concocts will lead to understanding God. Such a proposition — *yata mata, tata patha* — is foolish. Kṛṣṇa says, *bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ:* “Only by executing the activities of *bhakti* can one understand Me.” (*Bhāg.* 11.14.21) This is called *ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam,* remaining engaged favorably in the service of the Lord.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The two young demigods thus offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Godhead, is the master of all and was certainly Gokuleśvara, the master of Gokula, He was bound to the wooden mortar by the ropes of the gopīs, and therefore, smiling widely, He spoke to the sons of Kuvera the following words.**

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa was smiling because He was thinking to Himself, “These two young demigods fell from the higher planetary system to this planet, and I have delivered them from the bondage of standing for a long time as trees, but as for Me, I am bound by the ropes of the *gopīs* and am subject to their chastisements.” In other words, Kṛṣṇa submits to being chastised and bound by the *gopīs* because of pure love and affection worthy of being praised by a devotee in so many ways.

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The great saint Nārada Muni is very merciful. By his curse, he showed the greatest favor to both of you, who were mad after material opulence and who had thus become blind. Although you fell from the higher planet Svargaloka and became trees, you were most favored by him. I knew of all these incidents from the very beginning.**

### Purport

It is now confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the curse of a devotee is also to be regarded as mercy. As Kṛṣṇa, God, is all-good, a Vaiṣṇava is also all-good. Whatever he does is good for everyone. This is explained in the following verse.

**When one is face to face with the sun, there is no longer darkness for one’s eyes. Similarly, when one is face to face with a sādhu, a devotee, who is fully determined and surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one will no longer be subject to material bondage.**

### Purport

As stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu (Cc. *Madhya* 22.54):

*‘sādhu-saṅga,’ ‘sādhu-saṅga’ — sarva-śāstre kaya  
lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya*

If by chance one meets a *sādhu,* a devotee, one’s life is immediately successful, and one is freed from material bondage. It may be argued that whereas someone may receive a *sādhu* with great respect, someone else may not receive a *sādhu* with such respect. A *sādhu,* however, is always equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a pure devotee, a *sādhu* is always ready to deliver Kṛṣṇa consciousness without discrimination. As soon as one sees a *sādhu,* one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, persons who are too much offensive, who commit *vaiṣṇava-aparādhas,* or offenses to a *sādhu,* will have to take some time before being rectified. This is also indicated herein.
