CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE

This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa caused Mucukunda to kill Kālayavana with his harsh glance, and it also relates the conversation between Mucukunda and Lord Kṛṣṇa.

After placing His family members safely within the Dvārakā fortress, Śrī Kṛṣṇa went out of Mathurā. He appeared like the rising moon. Kālayavana saw that Kṛṣṇa’s brilliantly effulgent body matched Nārada’s description of the Lord, and thus the Yavana knew He was the Personality of Godhead. Seeing that the Lord carried no weapons, Kālayavana put his own weapons aside and ran toward Him from behind, wanting to fight with Him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa ran from the Yavana, staying just barely beyond Kālayavana’s grasp at every step and eventually leading him a long distance toward a mountain cave. As Kālayavana ran, he hurled insults at the Lord, but he could not grasp Him, since his stock of impious *karma* was not yet depleted. Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered the cave, whereupon Kālayavana followed after Him and saw a man lying on the ground. Taking him for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Kālayavana kicked him. The man had been sleeping for a very long time, and now, having been violently awakened, he looked around angrily in all directions and saw Kālayavana. The man stared harshly at him, igniting a fire in Kālayavana’s body and in a moment burning him to ashes.

This extraordinary person was a son of Mandhātā’s named Mucukunda. He was devoted to brahminical culture and always true to his vow. Previously, he had spent many long years helping to protect the demigods from the demons. When the demigods had eventually obtained Kārttikeya as their protector, they allowed Mucukunda to retire, offering him any boon other than liberation, which only Lord Viṣṇu can bestow. Mucukunda had chosen from the demigods the benediction of being covered by sleep, and thus since then he had been lying asleep within the cave.

Upon Kālayavana’s immolation, Śrī Kṛṣṇa showed Himself to Mucukunda, who was struck with wonder at seeing Kṛṣṇa’s incomparable beauty. Mucukunda asked Lord Kṛṣṇa who He was and also explained to the Lord his own identity. Mucukunda said, “After growing weary from remaining awake for a long time, I was enjoying my sleep here in this cave when some stranger disturbed me and, suffering the reaction of his sins, was burnt to ashes. O Lord, O vanquisher of all enemies, it is my great fortune that I now have the vision of Your beautiful form.”

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa then told Mucukunda who He was and offered him a boon. The wise Mucukunda, understanding the futility of material life, asked only that he might be allowed to take shelter of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.

Pleased at this request, the Lord said to Mucukunda, “My devotees are never enticed by material benedictions offered to them; only nondevotees, namely *yogīs* and speculative philosophers, are interested in material benedictions, having mundane desires in their hearts. My dear Mucukunda, you will have perpetual devotion for Me. Now, always remaining surrendered to Me, go perform penances to eradicate the sinful reactions incurred from the killing you had to do in your role as a warrior. In your next life you will become a first-class *brāhmaṇa* and attain Me.” Thus the Lord offered Mucukunda His blessings.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Kālayavana saw the Lord come out from Mathurā like the rising moon. The Lord was most beautiful to behold, with His dark-blue complexion and yellow silk garment. Upon His chest He bore the mark of Śrīvatsa, and the Kaustubha gem adorned His neck. His four arms were sturdy and long. He displayed His ever-joyful lotuslike face, with eyes pink like lotuses, beautifully effulgent cheeks, a pristine smile and glittering shark-shaped earrings. The barbarian thought, “This person must indeed be Vāsudeva, since He possesses the characteristics Nārada mentioned: He is marked with Śrīvatsa, He has four arms, His eyes are like lotuses, He wears a garland of forest flowers, and He is extremely handsome. He cannot be anyone else. Since He goes on foot and unarmed, I will fight Him without weapons.” Resolving thus, he ran after the Lord, who turned His back and ran away. Kālayavana hoped to catch Lord Kṛṣṇa, though great mystic yogīs cannot attain Him.**

### Purport

Although Kālayavana was seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa with his own eyes, he could not adequately appreciate the beautiful Lord. Thus instead of worshiping Kṛṣṇa, he attacked Him. Similarly, it is not uncommon for modern men to attack Kṛṣṇa in the name of philosophy, “law and order” and even religion.

### Translation

### Purport

The man who incinerated Kālayavana with his glance was named Mucukunda. As he will explain to Lord Kṛṣṇa, he had fought for a long time on behalf of the demigods, finally taking as his benediction the right to sleep undisturbed. The *Hari-vaṁśa* explains that he secured the further benediction of being able to destroy anyone who disturbed his sleep. Ācārya Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura quotes from the *Śrī Hari-vaṁśa* as follows:

*prasuptaṁ bodhayed yo māṁ  
taṁ daheyam ahaṁ surāḥ  
cakṣuṣā krodha-dīptena  
evam āha punaḥ punaḥ*

“Again and again Mucukunda said, ‘O demigods, with eyes blazing with anger, may I incinerate anyone who awakens me from sleep.’”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that Mucukunda made this rather morbid request to scare Lord Indra, who, Mucukunda thought, might otherwise wake him repeatedly to request his help in fighting Indra’s cosmic enemies. Indra’s consent to Mucukunda’s request is described in *Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa* as follows:

*proktaś ca devaiḥ saṁsuptaṁ  
yas tvām utthāpayiṣyati  
deha-jenāgninā sadyaḥ  
sa tu bhasmī-kariṣyati*

“The demigods declared, ‘Whoever awakens you from sleep will suddenly be burnt to ashes by a fire generated from his own body.’”

*kālo balīyān balināṁ  
bhagavān īśvaro ’vyayaḥ  
prajāḥ kālayate krīḍan

### Synonyms

*kālaḥ* — time; *balīyān* — more powerful; *balinām* — than the powerful; *bhagavān* *īśvaraḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *avyayaḥ* — inexhaustible; *prajāḥ* — mortal creatures; *kālayate* — causes to move; *krīḍan* — playing; *paśu*-*pālaḥ* — a herdsman; *yathā* — as; *paśūn* — domestic animals.

### Translation

**“Inexhaustible time, stronger than the strong, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Like a herdsman moving his animals along, He moves mortal creatures as His pastime.**

### Purport

The universe is created to gradually rectify the contaminated souls trying to exploit material nature. The Lord moves the conditioned souls along, according to their *karma,* through the various stages of spiritual rectification. Thus the Lord is like a herdsman (the word *paśu-pāla* literally means “protector of animals”), who moves the creatures under his protection to various pastures and watering spots in order to protect them and sustain them. A further analogy is that of a doctor, who moves the patient under his care to various areas of a hospital for diverse kinds of examination and treatment. Similarly, the Lord brings us through the network of material existence in a gradual cleansing process so that we can enjoy our eternal life of bliss and knowledge as His enlightened associates. Thus all of Mucukunda’s relatives, friends and co-workers had long ago been swept away by the force of time, which of course is Kṛṣṇa Himself.

“The King, exhausted by his labor, then chose sleep as his benediction. He further stated, ‘O best of the demigods, may whoever disturbs my sleep be immediately burned to ashes.’ The demigods replied, ‘So be it,’ and told him, ‘That insensitive person who wakes you in the middle of your sleep will immediately turn to ashes simply by your seeing him.’”

### Translation

**As he gazed at the Lord, King Mucukunda saw that He was dark blue like a cloud, had four arms, and wore a yellow silk garment. On His chest He bore the Śrīvatsa mark and on His neck the brilliantly glowing Kaustubha gem. Adorned with a Vaijayantī garland, the Lord displayed His handsome, peaceful face, which attracts the eyes of all mankind with its shark-shaped earrings and affectionately smiling glance. The beauty of His youthful form was unexcelled, and He moved with the nobility of an angry lion. The highly intelligent King was overwhelmed by the Lord’s effulgence, which showed Him to be invincible. Expressing his uncertainty, Mucukunda hesitantly questioned Lord Kṛṣṇa as follows.**

### Purport

It is significant that text 24 states, *catur-bhujaṁ rocamānam:* “The Lord was seen in the beauty of His four-armed form.” Throughout this great work, we find Lord Kṛṣṇa manifesting His various transcendental forms, most prominently the two-armed form of Kṛṣṇa and the four-armed form of Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu. Thus there is no doubt that Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu are nondifferent, or that Kṛṣṇa is the original form of the Lord. These things are sometimes misunderstood, but the great *ācāryas,* experts in spiritual science, have clarified the matter for us. God in His original form is not merely the creator, maintainer and destroyer, or the punisher of conditioned souls, but rather the infinitely beautiful Godhead, enjoying in His own right, in His own abode. This is the form of Kṛṣṇa, the same Kṛṣṇa who expands Himself into Viṣṇu forms for the maintenance of our bumbling world.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī mentions that the word *śaṅkitaḥ,* “having some doubt,” indicates that Mucukunda was thinking, “Is this indeed the Supreme Lord?” He expresses himself frankly in the following verses.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that with His effulgence Lord Kṛṣṇa dispelled not only the darkness of the mountain cave but also the darkness in Mucukunda’s heart. In Sanskrit the heart is sometimes metaphorically referred to as *guha,* “cavern,” a deep and secret place.

### Synonyms

*śuśrūṣatām* — who are eager to hear; *avyalīkam* — truthfully; *asmākam* — to us; *nara* — among men; *pum*-*gava* — O most eminent; *sva* — Your; *janma* — birth; *karma* — activity; *gotram* — lineage; *vā* — and; *kathyatām* — may it be told; *yadi* — if; *rocate* — it pleases.

### Translation

**O best among men, if You like, please truly describe Your birth, activities and lineage to us, who are eager to hear.**

### Purport

When the Supreme Lord descends to this world, He certainly becomes *nara-puṅgava,* the most eminent member of human society. Of course, the Lord is not actually a human being, and Mucukunda’s questions will lead to a clarification of this point. Thus the term *śuśrūṣatām,* “to us, who are sincerely eager to hear,” indicates that Mucukunda is inquiring in a noble way for his own and others’ benefit.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**As for ourselves, O tiger among men, we belong to a family of fallen kṣatriyas, descendants of King Ikṣvāku. My name is Mucukunda, my Lord, and I am the son of Yauvanāśva.**

### Purport

It is common in Vedic culture that a *kṣatriya* will humbly introduce himself as *kṣatra-bandhu,* a mere relative in a *kṣatriya* family, or in other words a fallen *kṣatriya.* In ancient Vedic culture, to claim a particular status on the basis of one’s family relations was itself indicative of a fallen position. *Kṣatriyas* and *brāhmaṇas* should be given status according to their merit, by their qualities of work and character. When the caste system in India became degraded, people proudly claimed to be relatives of *kṣatriyas* or *brāhmaṇas,* though in the past such a claim, unaccompanied by tangible qualifications, indicated a fallen position.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Mucukunda bowed down to the Lord when he heard this. Remembering the words of the sage Garga, he joyfully recognized Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa. The King then addressed Him as follows.**

### Purport

Although the Lord here appears as four-handed Nārāyaṇa, we may say that Mucukunda was addressing Śrī Kṛṣṇa. All of this is taking place within the context of *kṛṣṇa-līlā,* the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is well known to Vaiṣṇavas that the four-handed forms of Viṣṇu, or Nārāyaṇa, are expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus within the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa there may also appear *viṣṇu-līlā,* the activities of Viṣṇu. Such are the qualities and activities of the Supreme Godhead. Deeds that for us would be extraordinary and even impossible are commonplace, effortless pastimes for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī informs us that Mucukunda was aware of the prediction of the ancient sage Garga that in the twenty-eighth millennium the Supreme Lord would descend. According to Ācārya Viśvanātha, Garga Muni further informed Mucukunda that he would personally see the Lord. Now it was all happening.

श्रीमुचुकुन्द उवाच  
विमोहितोऽयं जन ईश मायया  
त्वदीयया त्वां न भजत्यनर्थद‍ृक् ।  
सुखाय दु-खप्रभवेषु सज्जते

### Verse text

śrī-mucukunda uvāca  
*vimohito ’yaṁ jana īśa māyayā  
tvadīyayā tvāṁ na bhajaty anartha-dṛk  
sukhāya duḥkha-prabhaveṣu sajjate  
gṛheṣu yoṣit puruṣaś ca vañcitaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*mucukundaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Mucukunda said; *vimohitaḥ* — bewildered; *ayam* — this; *janaḥ* — person; *īśa* — O Lord; *māyayā* — by the illusory energy; *tvadīyayā* — Your own; *tvām* — You; *na* *bhajati* — does not worship; *anartha*-*dṛk* — not seeing one’s real benefit; *sukhāya* — for the sake of happiness; *duḥkha* — misery; *prabhaveṣu* — in things that cause; *sajjate* — becomes entangled; *gṛheṣu* — in affairs of family life; *yoṣit* — woman; *puruṣaḥ* — man; *ca* — and; *vañcitaḥ* — cheated.

### Translation

**Śrī Mucukunda said: O Lord, the people of this world, both men and women, are bewildered by Your illusory energy. Unaware of their real benefit, they do not worship You but instead seek happiness by entangling themselves in family affairs, which are actually sources of misery.**

### Purport

Mucukunda immediately makes it clear that he is not going to ask the Lord for material blessings. He has advanced, spiritually, far beyond those who try to exploit religion for all kinds of material benefits. *Artha* means “value,” and the negation of this word, *anartha,* means “that which is valueless or useless.” Thus the term *anartha-dṛk* indicates those whose vision is focused on valueless things, who have not understood what actual *artha,* or value, is. All that glitters is not gold, and Mucukunda here emphatically states that we should not ruin our spiritual chances by entangling ourselves in the fool’s gold of bodily relationships. We are meant to love the Lord.

kathañcid avyaṅgam ayatnato ’nagha  
pādāravindaṁ na bhajaty asan-matir  
gṛhāndha-kūpe patito yathā paśuḥ*

### Synonyms

*labdhvā* — attaining; *janaḥ* — a person; *durlabham* — rarely obtained; *atra* — in this world; *mānuṣam* — the human form of life; *kathañcit* — somehow or other; *avyaṅgam* — with undistorted limbs (unlike the various animal forms); *ayatnataḥ* — without endeavor; *anagha* — O sinless one; *pāda* — Your feet; *aravindam* — lotuslike; *na* *bhajati* — he does not worship; *asat* — impure; *matiḥ* — his mentality; *gṛha* — of home; *andha* — blind; *kūpe* — in the well; *patitaḥ* — fallen; *yathā* — as; *paśuḥ* — an animal.

### Translation

**That person has an impure mind who, despite having somehow or other automatically obtained the rare and highly evolved human form of life, does not worship Your lotus feet. Like an animal that has fallen into a blind well, such a person has fallen into the darkness of a material home.**

### Purport

Our real home is in the kingdom of God. Despite our tenacious determination to remain in our material home, death will rudely eject us from the theater of material affairs. To stay at home is not bad, nor is it bad to devote ourselves to our loved ones. But we must understand that our real home is eternal, in the spiritual kingdom.

The word *ayatnataḥ* indicates that human life has been automatically awarded to us. We have not constructed our human bodies, and therefore we should not foolishly claim, “This body is mine.” The human form is a gift of God and should be used to achieve the perfection of God consciousness. One who does not understand this is *asan-mati,* possessed of dull, mundane understanding.

### Translation

**I have wasted all this time, O unconquerable one, becoming more and more intoxicated by my domain and opulence as an earthly king. Misidentifying the mortal body as the self, becoming attached to children, wives, treasury and land, I suffered endless anxiety.**

### Purport

Having in the previous verse condemned those who misuse the valuable human form of life for mundane purposes, Mucukunda now admits that he himself falls into this category. He intelligently wants to take advantage of the Lord’s association and become a pure devotee once and for all.

### Translation

### Translation

**A man obsessed with thoughts of what he thinks needs to be done, intensely greedy, and delighting in sense enjoyment is suddenly confronted by You, who are ever alert. Like a hungry snake licking its fangs before a mouse, You appear before him as death.**

### Purport

We may note here the contrast between the words *pramattam* and *apramattaḥ.* Those who are trying to exploit the material world are *pramatta:* “deluded, bewildered, maddened by desire.” But the Lord is *apramatta:* “alert, sober, and unbewildered.” In our madness we may deny God or His laws, but the Lord is sober and will not fail to reward or punish us according to the quality of our activities.

### Translation

**The body that at first rides high on fierce elephants or chariots adorned with gold and is known by the name “king” is later, by Your invincible power of time, called “feces,” “worms,” or “ashes.”**

### Purport

In the United States and other materially developed countries, dead bodies are cosmetically disposed of in a tidy ceremonial way, but in many parts of the world old, sickly and injured people die in lonely or neglected places, where dogs and jackals consume their bodies and transform them into stool. And if one is so blessed as to be buried in a coffin, one’s body may very well be consumed by worms and other minuscule creatures. Also, many earthly cadavers are burned and thus transformed into ashes. In any case, death is certain, and the ultimate fate of the body is never sublime. That is the real purport of Mucukunda’s statement here — that the body, though now called “king,” “prince,” “beauty queen,” “upper-middle class” and so on, will eventually be called “stool,” “worms” and “ashes.”

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes the following Vedic statement:

*yoneḥ sahasrāṇi bahūni gatvā  
duḥkhena labdhvāpi ca mānuṣatvam  
sukhāvahaṁ ye na bhajanti viṣṇuṁ  
te vai manuṣyātmani śatru-bhūtāḥ*

“After passing through many thousands of species and undergoing great struggle, the conditioned living entities finally obtain the human form. Thus those human beings who still do not worship Lord Viṣṇu, who can bring them real happiness, have certainly become enemies of both themselves and humanity.”

### Translation

### Translation

**When the material life of a wandering soul has ceased, O Acyuta, he may attain the association of Your devotees. And when he associates with them, there awakens in him devotion unto You, who are the goal of the devotees and the Lord of all causes and their effects.**

### Purport

Ācāryas Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī agree on the following point: Although it is stated here that when material life ceases one attains the association of devotees, in fact it is the association of the Lord’s devotees that enables one to transcend material existence. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains this apparent inversion of sequence by quoting the *Kāvya-prakāśa* (10.153) as follows: *kārya-kāraṇayoś ca paurvāparya-viparyayo vijñeyātiśayoktiḥ syāt sa.* “A statement in which the logical order of a cause and its effect is reversed should be understood as *atiśayokti,* emphasis by extreme assertion.” Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites the following commentary on this statement: *kāraṇasya śīghra-kārītāṁ vaktuṁ kāryasya pūrvam uktau.* “To express the swift action of a cause, one may assert the result before the cause.”

In this connection Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the merciful association of the Lord’s devotees makes possible our determination to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. And the *ācārya* agrees with Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī that this verse is an instance of *atiśayokti.*

You are not covered by mundane designations; rather, You are the Supreme Absolute Truth, full in pure knowledge and transcendental to the material modes.**

### Purport

The word *nirguṇam* here indicates that the Lord’s existence is beyond the qualities of material nature. One might argue that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body is made of material nature, but here the word *advayam* refutes that argument. There is no duality in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s existence. His eternal, spiritual body is Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is God.

### Purport

Śrī Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29), *suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati:* “A person attains peace by understanding Me to be the well-wishing friend of all living beings.” Lord Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotees work together to rescue the fallen souls from the ocean of illusion. This is the real purport of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Fifty-first Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Deliverance of Mucukunda.”*
