CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa consoled Devakī, Vasudeva and Nanda Mahārāja and installed Ugrasena as king. It also relates how Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma completed Their education, retrieved the dead son of Their *guru* and then returned home.

Noting that His parents — Vasudeva and Devakī — had realized His true position as God, Śrī Kṛṣṇa expanded His Yogamāyā to again make them think of Him as their dear child. Then, with Lord Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa approached them and said how unhappy He was that He and they had been unable to enjoy the mutual satisfaction of parents and children who live together. Then He stated, “Even in a lifetime of one hundred years, no son can ever repay the debt he owes his parents, from whom he receives his very body. Any capable son who fails to support his parents will be forced, in the hereafter, to eat his own flesh. Indeed, any person who does not maintain and nourish those under his care — children, wife, spiritual masters, *brāhmaṇas,* elderly parents, and so on — is simply a living corpse. It was out of fear of Kaṁsa that We could not serve you, so now please forgive Us.” Vasudeva and Devakī, overcome with emotion upon hearing these words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s, embraced their two sons and in ecstasy shed a torrent of tears.

Having thus satisfied His mother and father, Lord Kṛṣṇa offered Kaṁsa’s kingdom to His maternal grandfather, Ugrasena, and then arranged for all His family members who had fled in fear of Kaṁsa to return to their homes. Protected by the mighty arms of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, the Yādavas began to enjoy supreme bliss.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma next approached Nanda Mahārāja and praised him for having cared so lovingly for Them, another’s sons. Kṛṣṇa then said to Nanda, “Dear Father, please return to Vraja. Knowing how much you and Our other relatives are suffering in separation from Us, Balarāma and I will come to see you as soon as We have satisfied your friends here in Mathurā.” Kṛṣṇa then worshiped Nanda with various offerings, and Nanda felt overwhelmed with love for his sons. After tearfully embracing Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, he took the cowherd men and departed for Vraja. Next Vasudeva had his priests perform his sons’ ritual of second birth. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma then went to Garga Muni to take the vow of *brahmacarya,* celibacy. Afterward, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, though omniscient, desired to reside at the school of a spiritual master, and thus They went to live with Sāndīpani Muni at Avantīpura.

To teach the proper way to respect one’s *guru,* Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma served Their spiritual master with great devotion, as They would a Deity of the Supreme Lord Himself. Sāndīpani Muni, pleased by Their service, imparted to Them detailed knowledge of all the *Vedas,* together with their six corollaries and the *Upaniṣads.* Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma needed to hear each subject explained only once to assimilate it completely, and thus in sixty-four days They learned the sixty-four traditional arts.

Before taking leave of Their *guru,* the two Lords offered Sāndīpani Muni any gift he desired. The wise Sāndīpani, seeing Their amazing prowess, requested that They bring back his son, who had died in the ocean at Prabhāsa.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma mounted a chariot and went to Prabhāsa, where They approached the shore and were worshiped by the presiding deity of the ocean. Kṛṣṇa asked the ocean to return His spiritual master’s son, and the lord of the ocean replied that a demon dwelling within the ocean named Pāñcajana had taken the boy away. Hearing this, Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered the ocean, killed that demon and took the shell that had grown from his body. But when Kṛṣṇa did not find His *guru’s* son within the demon’s belly, He went to the planet of Yamarāja, the lord of death. Yamarāja came forward when he heard Kṛṣṇa blow the Pāñcajanya conchshell and devotedly worshiped Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa then asked Yamarāja for Sāndīpani Muni’s son, and Yamarāja immediately gave him to the two Lords.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma then returned to Their spiritual master and presented him with his son, requesting him to choose yet another favor. But Sāndīpani Muni replied that by having obtained disciples such as Them, all his desires were fulfilled. He thus instructed Them to return home.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma traveled to Their home by chariot, and upon Their arrival all the citizens became unlimitedly ecstatic to see Them, just like persons who have regained a lost treasure.

श्रीशुक उवाच  
पितरावुपलब्धार्थौ विदित्वा पुरुषोत्तम- ।  
मा भूदिति निजां मायां ततान जनमोहिनीम् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*pitarāv upalabdhārthau  
viditvā puruṣottamaḥ  
mā bhūd iti nijāṁ māyāṁ  
tatāna jana-mohinīm*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *pitarau* — His parents; *upalabdha* — having realized; *arthau* — the idea (of His opulent position as God); *viditvā* — knowing; *puruṣa*-*uttamaḥ* — the Supreme Personality; *mā* *bhūt* *iti* — “this should not be”; *nijām* — His personal; *māyām* — illusory potency; *tatāna* — He expanded; *jana* — His devotees; *mohinīm* — which bewilders.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Understanding that His parents were becoming aware of His transcendental opulences, the Supreme Personality of Godhead thought that this should not be allowed to happen. Thus He expanded His Yoga-māyā, which bewilders His devotees.**

### Purport

If Vasudeva and Devakī would have seen Kṛṣṇa as almighty God, their intense love for Him as their son would have been spoiled. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not want this. Rather, the Lord wanted to enjoy with them the ecstatic love of *vātsalya-rasa,* the relationship between parents and children. As Śrīla Prabhupāda often pointed out, although we normally think of God as the supreme father, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness we can enter into the Lord’s pastimes and play the part of His parents, thus intensifying our love for Him.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that the word *jana* may be translated here as “devotees,” as in the verse *dīyamānaṁ na gṛhṇanti vinā mat-sevanaṁ janaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 3.29.13). He further explains that *jana* may also be translated as “parents,” since *jana* is derived from the verb *jan,* which in the causative form (*janayate*) means “to generate or to give birth to.” In this sense of the word (as in *jananī* or *janakau*), the term *jana-mohinī* indicates that the Lord was about to expand His internal illusory potency so that Vasudeva and Devakī would again love Him as their dear child.

### Translation

**\[Lord Kṛṣṇa said:\] Dear Father, because of Us, your two sons, you and mother Devakī always remained in anxiety and could never enjoy Our childhood, boyhood or youth.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī discusses this verse as follows: “One may object that at this point Lord Kṛṣṇa had not actually passed the *kaiśora* stage \age ten to fifteen\], since the women of Mathurā had stated, *kva cāti-sukumārāṅgau kiśorau nāpta-yauvanau:* ‘Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma have very tender limbs, being still at the *kiśora* stage, not having reached adolescence.’ ([*Bhāg.* 10.44.8) The definition of the different stages of growing up is given as follows:

*kaumāraṁ pañcamābdāntaṁ  
paugaṇḍaṁ daśamāvadhi  
kaiśoram ā-pañcadaśād  
yauvanaṁ tu tataḥ param*

‘The *kaumāra* stage lasts until the age of five, *paugaṇḍa* up to age ten and *kaiśora* to age fifteen. From then on, one is known as *yauvana.*’ According to this statement, the *kaiśora* period ends at the age of fifteen. Kṛṣṇa was only eleven years old when He killed Kaṁsa, according to Uddhava’s words: *ekādaśa-samās tatra gūḍhārciḥ sa-balo ’vasat.* ‘Like a covered flame, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained there incognito with Balarāma for eleven years.’ (*Bhāg.* 3.2.26) And since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bhūmi, it was at the time \[of Their going to Mathurā\] that Their *kaiśora* stage began rather than ended.

“This objection to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statement in the present verse — that His parents could not enjoy His *kaiśora* stage — is based on ordinary measurement of age. Yet we should consider the following statement:

*kālenālpena rājarṣe  
rāmaḥ kṛṣṇaś ca go-vraje  
aghṛṣṭa-jānubhiḥ padbhir  
vicakramatur añjasā*

‘O King Parīkṣit, within a short time Rāma and Kṛṣṇa began to walk very easily in Gokula on Their legs, by Their own strength, without the need to crawl.’ Sometimes we see that the son of a king, even while in his *paugaṇḍa* stage of life, undergoes exceptional physical growth and exhibits activities appropriate to a *kaiśora.* Then what to speak of Lord Kṛṣṇa, whose exceptional growth is established in the *Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī,* *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* *Ānanda-vṛndavana-campū* and other works?

“The three years and four months that Lord Kṛṣṇa stayed in Mahāvana were the equivalent of five years for an ordinary child, and thus in that period He completed His *kaumāra* stage of childhood. The period from then to the age of six years and eight months, during which He lived in Vṛndāvana, constitutes His *paugaṇḍa* stage. And the period from the age of six years and eight months through His tenth year, during which time He lived in Nandīśvara \[Nandagrāma\], constitutes His *kaiśora* stage. Then, at the age of ten years and seven months, on the eleventh lunar day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra, He went to Mathurā, and on the fourteenth day thereafter He killed Kaṁsa. Thus He completed His *kaiśora* period at age ten, and He eternally remains at that age. In other words, we should understand that from this point on the Lord remains forever a *kiśora.*”

Thus Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī analyzes the intricacies of this verse.

**With one’s body one can acquire all goals of life, and it is one’s parents who give the body birth and sustenance. Therefore no mortal man can repay his debt to his parents, even if he serves them for a full lifetime of a hundred years.**

### Purport

Having stated, “Both you, Our parents, and We have suffered because of Our separation,” Kṛṣṇa now states that His and Balarāma’s religious principles have been spoiled by Their failure to satisfy Their parents.

### Purport

According to Sanskrit grammar, the words *para-tantrayoḥ* and *kliṣṭayoḥ* may also refer to Vasudeva and Devakī. Actually, Vasudeva and Devakī were under the control of Providence and were disturbed by the activities of Kaṁsa, whereas Śrī Kṛṣṇa is always the absolute Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

### Purport

Ugrasena might have told the Lord, “My dear Lord, it is actually You who should sit on the throne.” Anticipating this statement, Lord Kṛṣṇa told Ugrasena that because of Yayāti’s ancient curse, princes in the Yadu dynasty could technically not sit on the royal throne, and therefore Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were disqualified. Of course, Ugrasena also could be considered part of the Yadu dynasty, but by the order of the Lord he could sit on the royal throne. In conclusion, these were all pastimes the Supreme Lord enjoyed as He played the part of a human being.

Then Lord Kṛṣṇa, the creator of the universe, resettled them in their homes and gratified them with valuable gifts.**

### Purport

Western scholars sometimes think that references in ancient books of wisdom to the deity of the ocean, the deity of the sun and so on reveal a primitive, mythical way of thinking. They sometimes say that primitive men think that the ocean is a god or that the sun and moon are gods. In fact, references such as the word *sindhu* in this verse, meaning “the ocean,” indicate the person who governs that aspect of physical nature.

We can give several modern examples. In the United Nations we may say, “The United States votes ‘Yes,’ the Soviet Union votes ‘No.’” We hardly mean that the physical countries or the buildings in them have voted. We mean that a particular person, representing that political and geographical entity, has voted. Yet the newspapers will simply say, “The United States voted, decided, etc.” and everyone knows what that means.

Similarly, in business we may say, “A large conglomerate has swallowed up a smaller firm.” We hardly mean that the buildings, office equipment and the like have physically swallowed another building full of workers and office equipment. We mean that the empowered authorities have engaged in a particular act on behalf of their respective corporate entities.

Unfortunately, modern scholars are eager to confirm their pet theories that ancient spiritual wisdom is primitive, mythic and largely supplanted by more modern ways of thinking, exemplified by their own eloquent remarks. However, much in modern scholarship must be rethought in the light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**Lord Janārdana took the conchshell that had grown around the demon’s body and went back to the chariot. Then He proceeded to Saṁyamanī, the beloved capital of Yamarāja, the lord of death. Upon arriving there with Lord Balarāma, He loudly blew His conchshell, and Yamarāja, who keeps the conditioned souls in check, came as soon as he heard the resounding vibration. Yamarāja elaborately worshiped the two Lords with great devotion, and then he addressed Lord Kṛṣṇa, who lives in everyone’s heart: “O Supreme Lord Viṣṇu, what shall I do for You and Lord Balarāma, who are playing the part of ordinary humans?”**

### Purport

The conchshell the Lord took from Pañcajana, which is called Pāñcajanya, is the same one He sounded at the beginning of the *Bhagavad-gītā.* According to the *ācāryas,* Pañcajana had become a demon in a way similar to that of Jaya and Vijaya. In other words, though appearing in the form of a demon, he was actually a devotee of the Lord. The *Skanda Purāṇa,* *Avanti-khaṇḍa,* describes the wonderful things that happened when Lord Kṛṣṇa sounded His conchshell:

*asipatra-vanaṁ nāma  
śīrṇa-patram ajāyata  
rauravaṁ nāma narakam  
arauravam abhūt tada  
abhairavaṁ bhairavākhyaṁ  
kumbhī-pākam apācakam*

“The hell known as Asipatra-vana lost the sharp, swordlike leaves on its trees, and the hell named Raurava became free of its *ruru* beasts. The Bhairava hell lost its fearfulness, and all cooking stopped in the Kumbhīpāka hell.”

The *Skanda Purāṇa* further states:

*pāpa-kṣayāt tataḥ sarve  
vimuktā nārakā narāḥ  
padam avyayam āsādya*

“Their sinful reactions eradicated, all the inhabitants of hell attained liberation and approached the spiritual world.”
