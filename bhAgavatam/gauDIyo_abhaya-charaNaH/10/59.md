CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE

This chapter tells how Lord Kṛṣṇa killed Narakāsura, the son of the earth-goddess, and married the thousands of maidens the demon had kidnapped. It also describes how the Lord stole the *pārijāta* tree from heaven and how He behaved like an ordinary householder in each of His palaces.

After Narakāsura stole Lord Varuṇa’s umbrella, mother Aditi’s earrings, and the playground of the demigods known as Maṇi-parvata, Indra went to Dvārakā and described the demon’s transgressions to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Together with Queen Satyabhāmā, the Lord mounted His carrier Garuḍa and traveled to the capital of Narakāsura’s kingdom. On a field outside the city He decapitated the demon Mura with His disc. Then He fought Mura’s seven sons and sent them all to the abode of death, after which Narakāsura himself entered the battlefield on the back of an elephant. Naraka threw his *śakti* lance at Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but the weapon proved ineffective, and the Lord cut the demon’s entire army to pieces. Finally, with His sharp-edged disc Kṛṣṇa cut off Narakāsura’s head.

The earth-goddess, Pṛthivī, then approached Lord Kṛṣṇa and gave Him the various items Narakāsura had stolen. She offered prayers to the Lord and presented Naraka’s frightened son at Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. After pacifying the demon’s son, Kṛṣṇa entered Narakāsura’s palace, where He found sixteen thousand one hundred young women. As soon as they caught sight of the Lord, they all decided to accept Him as their husband. The Lord sent them to Dvārakā along with a great quantity of treasure and then went with Queen Satyabhāmā to the abode of Indra. There He returned Aditi’s earrings, and Indra and his wife, Śacīdevī, worshiped Him. On Satyabhāmā’s request, Lord Kṛṣṇa uprooted the heavenly *pārijāta* tree and put it on the back of Garuḍa. After defeating Indra and the other demigods who opposed His taking of the tree, Kṛṣṇa returned with Queen Satyabhāmā to Dvārakā, where He planted it in a garden adjacent to Satyabhāmā’s palace.

Indra had originally come to Lord Kṛṣṇa offering obeisances and begging Him to kill Narakāsura, but afterwards, when his business had been accomplished, he quarreled with the Lord. The demigods are prone to anger because they become intoxicated with pride in their opulences.

The infallible Supreme Lord manifested Himself in sixteen thousand one hundred separate forms and married each of the sixteen thousand one hundred brides in a different temple. He took up the required activities of household life just like an ordinary person, accepting various kinds of service from each of His many wives.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: After Bhauma had stolen the earrings belonging to Indra’s mother, along with Varuṇa’s umbrella and the demigods’ playground at the peak of Mandara mountain, Indra went to Lord Kṛṣṇa and informed Him of these misdeeds. The Lord, taking His wife Satyabhāmā with Him, then rode on Garuḍa to Prāgyotiṣa-pura, which was surrounded on all sides by fortifications consisting of hills, unmanned weapons, water, fire and wind, and by obstructions of mura-pāśa wire.**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* have explained in various plausible ways why Lord Kṛṣṇa took His wife Satyabhāmā with Him. Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī begins by saying that the Lord wanted to give His adventurous wife a novel experience and thus took her to the scene of this extraordinary battle. Also, Lord Kṛṣṇa had once granted the blessing to Bhūmi, the earth-goddess, that He would not kill her demoniac son without her permission. Since Bhūmi is an expansion of Satyabhāmā, the latter could authorize Kṛṣṇa to do the needful with the unusually nasty Bhaumāsura.

Finally, Satyabhāmā had been miffed when Nārada Muni brought a celestial *pārijāta* flower to Queen Rukmiṇī. To pacify Satyabhāmā, Lord Kṛṣṇa had promised her, “I’ll give you a whole tree of these flowers,” and thus the Lord scheduled this procurement of a heavenly tree within His itinerary.

Even nowadays devoted husbands take their wives shopping, and thus Lord Kṛṣṇa took Satyabhāmā to the heavenly planets to get a heavenly tree, as well as to retrieve the goods Bhaumāsura had stolen and return them to their rightful owners.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī notes that in the heat of battle Queen Satyabhāmā would naturally become anxious for Lord Kṛṣṇa’s safety and pray for the battle to end. Thus she would readily give permission to Kṛṣṇa to kill the son of her expansion, Bhūmi.

### Purport

The earth-goddess, in her prayers, directly touches upon the subtleties of transcendental philosophy, clarifying that although the Supreme Lord is unique and distinct from His creation, His creation has no independent existence and always rests within Him. Thus the Lord and His creation are simultaneously one and different, as explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu five hundred years ago.

To say that everything is God, without any distinction, is meaningless, since nothing can act like God. Dogs, shoes and human beings are hardly omnipotent or omniscient, nor do they create the universe. On the other hand, there is a real sense in which all things are one, for everything is part of the same supreme, absolute reality. Lord Caitanya has given the very useful analogy of the sun and the sun rays. The sun and its sunshine are one reality, for the sun is the celestial body that shines. On the other hand, one can certainly distinguish between the sun globe and the sun rays. Thus God’s simultaneous oneness with and difference from His creation is the final and satisfying explanation of reality. All that exists is the Lord’s potency, and yet He endows the superior potency, the living beings, with free will so that they can become responsible for the moral and spiritual quality of their decisions and activities.

This entire transcendental science is clearly and rationally explained in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

*kanyā-pure sa kanyānāṁ  
ṣoḍaśātulya-vikramaḥ  
śatādhikāni dadṛśe

“Within the maidens’ quarters, O wise one, that Lord of unequaled prowess found 16,100 princesses.”

Another relevant verse from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (5.29.9) is as follows:

*deva-siddhāsurādīnāṁ  
nṛpānāṁ ca janārdana  
hṛtvā hi so ’suraḥ kanyā

*atho muhūrta ekasmin  
nānāgāreṣu tāḥ striyaḥ  
yathopayeme bhagavān

### Synonyms

*atha* *u* — and then; *muhūrte* — at the auspicious time; *ekasmin* — same; *nānā* — various; *agāreṣu* — in residences; *tāḥ* — those; *striyaḥ* — women; *yathā* — properly; *upayeme* — married; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Lord; *tāvat* — that many; *rūpa* — forms; *dharaḥ* — assuming; *avyayaḥ* — the imperishable one.

### Translation

**Then the imperishable Supreme Personality, assuming a separate form for each bride, duly married all the princesses simultaneously, each in her own palace.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains, here the word *yathā* indicates that each marriage was duly performed. This means that the entire company of the Lord’s relatives, including His mother Devakī, appeared in each and every palace and attended each and every wedding. Since all these weddings took place simultaneously, this event was surely a manifestation of the Lord’s inconceivable potency.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa does things, He does them in style. So it is not astonishing that the Lord simultaneously appeared in 16,100 wedding ceremonies taking place in 16,100 royal palaces, accompanied in each palace by all His relatives. Indeed, this is the way one would expect the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do things. After all, He is not an ordinary human being.

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī further explains that on this particular occasion the Lord manifested His original form in each of His palaces. In other words, to take part in the wedding vows, He manifested identical forms (*prakāśa*) in all the palaces.

### Synonyms

*gṛheṣu* — in the residences; *tāsām* — their; *anapāyī* — never leaving; *atarka* — inconceivable; *kṛt* — performing deeds; *nirasta* — which refuted; *sāmya* — equality; *atiśayeṣu* — and superiority; *avasthitaḥ* — remaining; *reme* — He enjoyed; *ramābhiḥ* — with the pleasing women; *nija* — His own; *kāma* — in the pleasure; *samplutaḥ* — absorbed; *yathā* — as; *itaraḥ* — any other man; *gārhaka*-*medhikān* — the duties of household life; *caran* — carrying out.

### Translation

**The Lord, performer of the inconceivable, constantly remained in each of His queens’ palaces, which were unequaled and unexcelled by any other residence. There, although fully satisfied within Himself, He enjoyed with His pleasing wives, and like an ordinary husband He carried out His household duties.**

### Purport

The word *atarka-kṛt* is significant here. *Tarka* means “logic,” and *atarka* means “that which is beyond logic.” The Lord can perform (*kṛt*) that which is beyond mundane logic and hence inconceivable. Still, the Lord’s activities can be appreciated and understood to a significant extent by those who surrender unto Him. This is the secret of *bhakti,* loving devotion to the Supreme Lord.

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī comments that the Lord was always at home except for when He had to go out to do ordinary household duties. And Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that since in the Vaikuṇṭha planets Lord Nārāyaṇa enjoys with only one goddess of fortune and in Dvārakā Kṛṣṇa enjoys with thousands of queens, Dvārakā must be considered superior to Vaikuṇṭha. In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also quotes the following passage from the *Skanda Purāṇa:*

*ṣoḍaśaiva sahasrāṇi  
gopyas tawra samāgatāḥ  
haṁsa eva mataḥ kṛṣṇaḥ  
paramātmā janārdanaḥ*

*tasyaitāḥ śaktayo devi  
ṣoḍaśaiva prakīṛtitāḥ  
candra-rūpī mataḥ kṛṣṇaḥ  
kalā-rūpās tu tāḥ smṛtāḥ*

*sampūrṇa-maṇḍalā tāsāṁ  
mālinī ṣoḍaśī kalā  
ṣoḍaśaiva kalā yāsu  
gopī-rūpā varāṅgane*

*ekaikaśas tāḥ sambhinnāḥ  
sahasreṇa pṛthak pṛthak*

“At that place sixteen thousand *gopīs* were assembled with Kṛṣṇa, who is considered the Supreme, the Supersoul, the shelter of all living beings. These *gopīs* are His renowned sixteen potencies, O goddess. Kṛṣṇa is like the moon, the *gopīs* are like its phases, and the full contingent of *gopīs* is like the full sequence of the moon’s sixteen phases. Each of these sixteen divisions of *gopīs,* my dear Varāṅganā, is subdivided into one thousand parts.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further quotes the *Kārttika-māhātmya* section of the *Padma Purāṇa:* *kaiśore gopa-kanyās tā yauvane rāja-kanyakāḥ.* “Those who were the daughters of cowherds in their early youth became royal princesses in their maturity.” The *ācārya* adds, “Therefore just as the Lord of Dvārakā is a plenary expansion of the supremely complete Lord of Śrī Vṛndāvana, so His principal queens are full expansions of His supremely complete pleasure potencies, the *gopīs.”*
