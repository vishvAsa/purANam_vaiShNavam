CHAPTER FORTY

This chapter relates Akrūra’s prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Akrūra prayed, “Brahmā, who created this visible world, emanated from the lotus navel of the Supreme Lord. The five elements of physical nature, the five corresponding objects of perception, the ten senses, the ego, the total nature, the primeval creator and the demigods all originate from His bodily limbs. He cannot be known by sensory knowledge, and thus even Brahmā and the other demigods are ignorant of His real identity.

“Different classes of people worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in different ways. Fruitive workers worship Him by performing Vedic sacrifices, philosophers by renouncing material work and pursuing spiritual knowledge, *yogīs* by meditating, Śaivites by worshiping Lord Śiva, Vaiṣṇavas by following the injunctions of such scriptures as the *Pañcarātra,* and other saintly persons by worshiping Him as the original form of the self, of the material substance and of the controlling demigods. Just as rivers flow from various directions into the ocean, the worship of those who dedicate themselves to these various entities finds its ultimate purpose within the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu.

“The form of the total universe, the Virāṭ-rūpa, is imagined to be the form of Lord Viṣṇu. Like aquatics moving about in water or like tiny insects burrowing in an *udumbara* fruit, all living beings move about within the Lord. These living beings, bewildered by His Māyā, wander along the path of material work, falsely identifying with body, home and so forth. Under the sway of illusion, a foolish person may overlook a reservoir of water covered by grass and leaves and instead run after a mirage. Similarly, living beings caught in the grip of ignorance abandon Lord Viṣṇu and become attached to their bodies, homes and so on. Such faithful servants of their senses cannot take shelter of the Supreme Lord’s lotus feet. Only if, by His mercy, they get the association of saintly devotees will their material entanglement end. Only then can they develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness by serving the Lord’s pure devotees.”

नैते स्वरूपं विदुरात्मनस्ते  
ह्यजादयोऽनात्मतया गृहीता- ।

### Verse text

*naite svarūpaṁ vidur ātmanas te  
hy ajādayo ’nātmatayā gṛhītaḥ  
ajo ’nubaddhaḥ sa guṇair ajāyā  
guṇāt paraṁ veda na te svarūpam*

### Synonyms

*na* — do not; *ete* — these (elements of creation); *svarūpam* — the true identity; *viduḥ* — know; *ātmanaḥ* — of the Supreme Soul; *te* — You; *hi* — indeed; *ajā*-*ādayaḥ* — headed by the total material nature; *anātmatayā* — by the status of being nonliving matter; *gṛhītāḥ* — seized; *ajaḥ* — Lord Brahmā; *anubaddhaḥ* — bound up; *saḥ* — he; *guṇaiḥ* — by the modes; *ajāyāḥ* — of material nature; *guṇāt* — to these modes; *param* — transcendental; *veda* *na* — he does not know; *te* — Your; *svarūpam* — true form.

### Translation

**The total material nature and these other elements of creation certainly cannot know You as You are, for they are manifested in the realm of dull matter. Since You are beyond the modes of nature, even Lord Brahmā, who is bound up in these modes, does not know Your true identity.**

### Purport

God is transcendental to material nature. Unless we also transcend the limited consciousness of material existence, we cannot know Him. Even the greatest living entity in the universe, Brahmā, cannot understand the Supreme unless he comes to the platform of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

त्रय्या च विद्यया केचित्त्वां वै वैतानिका द्विजा- ।

### Verse text

*trayyā ca vidyayā kecit  
tvāṁ vai vaitānikā dvijāḥ  
yajante vitatair yajñair  
nānā-rūpāmarākhyayā*

### Synonyms

*trayyā* — of the three *Vedas*; *ca* — and; *vidyayā* — by the *mantras*; *kecit* — some; *tvām* — You; *vai* — indeed; *vaitānikāḥ* — who respect the regulations of the three sacred fires; *dvijāḥ* — *brāhmaṇas*; *yajante* — worship; *vitataiḥ* — elaborate; *yajñaiḥ* — with ritual sacrifices; *nānā* — various; *rūpa* — having forms; *amara* — of demigods; *ākhyayā* — by the designations.

### Translation

**Brāhmaṇas who follow the regulations concerning the three sacred fires worship You by chanting mantras from the three Vedas and performing elaborate fire sacrifices for the various demigods, who have many forms and names.**

### Purport

Akrūra has now described how those who follow the paths of Sāṅkhya, *yoga* and the three *Vedas* worship the Supreme Lord in different ways. In the various places where the *Vedas* appear to recommend that one worship Indra, Varuṇa and other demigods, these demigods are stated to be supreme. But at the same time the *Vedas* state that there is one supreme controller, the Absolute Truth. That is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who expands His potency through material creation into the forms of the demigods. Thus worship of the demigods goes to Him through the indirect method of *karma-kāṇḍa,* or fruitive religious rituals. Ultimately, however, one who wants to achieve eternal perfection should worship the Lord directly, in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Devanagari

एके त्वाखिलकर्माणि सन्न्यस्योपशमं गता- ।  
ज्ञानिनो ज्ञानयज्ञेन यजन्ति ज्ञानविग्रहम् ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*eke tvākhila-karmāṇi  
sannyasyopaśamaṁ gatāḥ  
jñānino jñāna-yajñena  
yajanti jñāna-vigraham*

### Synonyms

*eke* — some; *tvā* — to You; *akhila* — all; *karmāṇi* — activities; *sannyasya* — resigning; *upaśamam* — peace; *gatāḥ* — attaining; *jñāninaḥ* — pursuers of knowledge; *jñāna*-*yajñena* — by the sacrifice of cultivating knowledge; *yajanti* — they worship; *jñāna*-*vigraham* — the embodiment of knowledge.

### Translation

**In pursuit of spiritual knowledge, some persons renounce all material activities and, having thus become peaceful, perform the sacrifice of philosophic investigation to worship You, the original form of all knowledge.**

### Purport

Modern philosophers pursue knowledge without bothering to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus they naturally end up with meager, if not trivial, results.

### Devanagari

अन्ये च संस्कृतात्मानो विधिनाभिहितेन ते ।  
यजन्ति त्वन्मयास्त्वां वै बहुमूर्त्येकमूर्तिकम् ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*anye ca saṁskṛtātmāno  
vidhinābhihitena te  
yajanti tvan-mayās tvāṁ vai  
bahu-mūrty-eka-mūrtikam*

### Synonyms

*anye* — others; *ca* — and; *saṁskṛta* — purified; *ātmānaḥ* — whose intelligence; *vidhinā* — by the injunctions (of such scriptures as the Pañcarātra); *abhihitena* — presented; *te* — by You; *yajanti* — worship; *tvat*-*mayāḥ* — filled with thought of You; *tvām* — You; *vai* — indeed; *bahu*-*mūrti* — having many forms; *eka*-*mūrtikam* — having one form.

### Translation

**And yet others — those whose intelligence is pure — follow the injunctions of Vaiṣṇava scriptures promulgated by You. Absorbing their minds in thought of You, they worship You as the one Supreme Lord manifesting in multiple forms.**

### Purport

The word *saṁskṛtātmānaḥ,* “they whose intelligence is pure,” is significant here. It implies that the worshipers mentioned before have not completely purified their intelligence of material contamination and thus worship the Lord indirectly. Those who are purified, however, directly worship the Lord, either as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, or as one of His various plenary forms, such as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna or Aniruddha, as indicated here.

### Devanagari

त्वामेवान्ये शिवोक्तेन मार्गेण शिवरूपिणम् ।

### Verse text

*tvām evānye śivoktena  
mārgeṇa śiva-rūpiṇam  
bahv-ācārya-vibhedena  
bhagavantam upāsate*

### Synonyms

*tvām* — You; *eva* — also; *anye* — others; *śiva* — by Lord Śiva; *uktena* — spoken; *mārgeṇa* — by the path; *śiva*-*rūpiṇam* — in the form of Lord Śiva; *bahu*-*ācārya* — of many teachers; *vibhedena* — following the different presentations; *bhagavantam* — the Supreme Lord; *upāsate* — they worship.

### Translation

**There are still others, who worship You, the Supreme Lord, in the form of Lord Śiva. They follow the path described by him and interpreted in various ways by many teachers.**

### Purport

The words *tvām eva,* “You also,” indicate that the path of worshiping Lord Śiva is indirect and therefore inferior. Akrūra himself is following the superior method by directly worshiping Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu, with his prayers.

सर्व एव यजन्ति त्वां सर्वदेवमयेश्वरम् ।  
येऽप्यन्यदेवताभक्ता यद्यप्यन्यधिय- प्रभो ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*sarva eva yajanti tvāṁ

### Translation

**But all these people, my Lord, even those who have turned their attention away from You and are worshiping other deities, are actually worshiping You alone, O embodiment of all the demigods.**

### Purport

The idea here is that even those who worship the demigods are indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu. The understanding of such worshipers, however, is imperfect.

यथाद्रिप्रभवा नद्य- पर्जन्यापूरिता- प्रभो ।

tadvat tvāṁ gatayo ’ntataḥ*

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *adri* — from the mountains; *prabhavāḥ* — born; *nadyaḥ* — rivers; *parjanya* — by the rain; *āpūritāḥ* — filled; *prabho* — O master; *viśanti* — enter; *sarvataḥ* — from all sides; *sindhum* — the ocean; *tadvat* — similarly; *tvām* — You; *gatayaḥ* — these paths; *antataḥ* — finally.

### Translation

**As rivers born from the mountains and filled by the rain flow from all sides into the sea, so do all these paths in the end reach You, O master.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself speaks on this issue of worship in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.23-25):

*ye ’py anya-devatā-bhaktā  
yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ  
te ’pi mām eva kaunteya  
yayanty avidhi-pūrvakam*

*ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ  
bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca  
na tu mām abhijānanti  
tattvenātaś cyavanti te*

*yānti deva-vratā devān  
pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ  
bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā  
yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām*

“Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kuntī, but they do so in a wrong way. I am the only enjoyer and master of all sacrifices. Therefore, those who do not recognize My true transcendental nature fall down. Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.”
