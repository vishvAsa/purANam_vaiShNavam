CHAPTER EIGHTY-SIX

This chapter describes how Arjuna kidnapped Subhadrā and how Lord Kṛṣṇa went to Mithilā to bless His devotees Bahulāśva and Śrutadeva.

When King Parīkṣit desired to learn about the marriage of his grandmother, Subhadrā-devī, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, “While touring on pilgrimage, Arjuna heard that Lord Baladeva intended to give the hand of His sister Subhadrā to Duryodhana in marriage. Wanting to kidnap Subhadrā and marry her himself, Arjuna disguised himself as a renunciant and went to Dvārakā. So effective was the disguise that neither Balarāma nor any other resident of Dvārakā recognized him; rather, they all showed him the respect due a Vaiṣṇava mendicant. In this way the four months of the rainy season passed. One day Arjuna received an invitation to dine at Lord Balarāma’s home. There he caught sight of Subhadrā and was immediately overwhelmed with desire for her. Subhadrā also desired to have Arjuna as her husband, and thus she glanced back at him shyly. A few days later, Subhadrā left the palace to participate in a chariot festival. Taking this opportunity, Arjuna abducted Subhadrā and defeated the Yādavas who tried to stop him. Lord Balarāma was at first greatly angered to hear of this, but when Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and other family members pacified Him, He became joyful and sent the bride and groom off with elaborate wedding gifts.”

There was a *brāhmaṇa* devotee of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s named Śrutadeva, who lived in the city of Mithilā. By the will of Providence, he could earn only barely enough to keep himself and his family alive. Still, he was always satisfied and spent all his time executing his religious duties. King Bahulāśva was another great devotee of the Lord residing in Mithilā. A member of the dynasty in which King Janaka had appeared, Bahulāśva ruled over the whole province of Videha, yet he remained as detached from material wealth as Śrutadeva. Pleased with the devotional attitude of both these great souls, Lord Kṛṣṇa went on His chariot to Mithilā to visit them, taking along Nārada and several other learned sages. The people of Mithilā greeted the Lord and His saintly entourage with great delight. Bearing various gifts for Kṛṣṇa, they bowed down and offered obeisances to both Him and the sages.

Bahulāśva and Śrutadeva both stepped forward and respectfully requested Śrī Kṛṣṇa to visit their homes. To satisfy both of them, the Lord expanded Himself and went to each of their homes simultaneously. They each worshiped Him suitably, offered prayers, washed His feet and then sprinkled themselves and all their family members with the wash water. Lord Kṛṣṇa then praised the sages who were with Him and glorified *brāhmaṇas* in general. He also imparted instructions to His hosts concerning devotional service. Understanding these instructions, both Śrutadeva and Bahulāśva honored the sages and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa with single-minded devotion. Lord Kṛṣṇa then returned to Dvārakā.

श्रीराजोवाच  
ब्रह्मन् वेदितुमिच्छाम- स्वसारां रामकृष्णयो- ।  
यथोपयेमे विजयो या ममासीत् पितामही ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-rājovāca  
*brahman veditum icchāmaḥ  
svasārāṁ rāma-kṛṣṇayoḥ  
yathopayeme vijayo  
yā mamāsīt pitāmahī*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*rājā* *uvāca* — the great King (Parīkṣit) said; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa* (Śukadeva); *veditum* — to know; *icchāmaḥ* — we wish; *svasāram* — the sister; *rāma*-*kṛṣṇayoḥ* — of Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa; *yathā* — how; *upayeme* — married; *vijayaḥ* — Arjuna; *yā* — she who; *mama* — my; *āsīt* — was; *pitāmahī* — the grandmother.

### Translation

**King Parīkṣit said: O brāhmaṇa, we would like to learn how Arjuna married Lord Balarāma’s and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s sister, who was my grandmother.**

### Purport

Parīkṣit Mahārāja turns now to the topic of the marriage of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s sister, Subhadrā. In the opinion of Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, King Parīkṣit’s question here follows from the previous narration because Arjuna’s winning the hand of Subhadrā was just as difficult a feat as Lord Kṛṣṇa’s retrieving the sons of Devakī from the realm of the dead, since Lord Balarāma Himself opposed Subhadrā’s marriage to Arjuna.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: While traveling far and wide visiting various holy places of pilgrimage, Arjuna came to Prabhāsa. There he heard that Lord Balarāma intended to give his maternal cousin Subhadrā to Duryodhana in marriage, and that no one else approved of this plan. Arjuna wanted to marry her himself, so he disguised himself as a renunciant, complete with triple staff, and went to Dvārakā.**

### Purport

Arjuna’s plan for obtaining Subhadrā as his wife may have seemed unconventional, but he was not acting without encouragement; in fact, Lord Kṛṣṇa was his prime co-conspirator. And in Dvārakā, most of the members of the royal family, especially Vasudeva, were unhappy about giving their favorite daughter to Duryodhana.

### Purport

From the explanation of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, it is understood that Arjuna in his *sannyāsī* role had just finished the four-month vows of the rainy season and could now again accept general invitations from householders. Thus no one would have suspected any unusual motive in his visiting Lord Balarāma at this time.

### Translation

### Purport

As soon as she saw him, Subhadrā knew that Arjuna was no *sannyāsī* but rather her destined consort. In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda elaborates: “Arjuna, the grandfather of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, was himself extraordinarily beautiful and his bodily structure was very attractive to Subhadrā. Subhadrā also decided within her mind that she would accept only Arjuna as her husband. As a simple girl, she was smiling with great pleasure, looking at Arjuna.”

### Purport

Even while being honored by Lord Balarāma, Arjuna was too distracted to appreciate the Lord’s gracious hospitality. Arjuna’s distraction and Lord Balarāma’s failure to recognize Arjuna in his disguise were both arrangements of the Supreme Lord to enjoy His transcendental pastimes.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī identifies this festival as the annual Ratha-yātrā for Lord Viṣṇu on the occasion of His rising from mystic sleep at the end of Cāturmāsya. Subhadrā’s parents are Vasudeva and Devakī.

An ideal Vaiṣṇava *brāhmaṇa,* even if encumbered by the ties of family life, should work only as hard as required to meet his obligations. Without being unnecessarily agitated for material advancement, he should devote the best part of his time and assets to his higher duties in the Supreme Lord’s service. If a householder can succeed in this program despite the unavoidable difficulties of this degraded age, he can expect Lord Kṛṣṇa’s personal attention, as will be seen in the case of Śrutadeva, the perfect *brāhmaṇa* of Mithilā.

### Purport

In his commentary on this verse, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that Śrutadeva and Bahulāśva were unable to travel to Dvārakā to see Lord Kṛṣṇa because both of them had vowed to regularly worship their personal Deity at home. Śrī Kṛṣṇa was very glad to go out of His way to give them both His audience, and while leaving Dvārakā He insisted that the sages who wanted to come with Him should join Him on His chariot, because otherwise they would exhaust themselves following on foot. Renowned sages would ordinarily never even consider traveling in such an opulent conveyance, but on the Lord’s order they put aside their natural aversion and joined Him on His chariot.

As He thus endowed them with fearlessness and divine vision, He heard demigods and men singing His glories, which purify the entire universe and destroy all misfortune. Gradually, He reached Videha.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī raises the logical question of how the ordinary people along the path could even see the Lord, since not only were their eyes covered by ignorance, but the Lord’s chariot was traveling faster than the wind. Supplying the answer, Śrīla Jīva indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa’s special glance of mercy empowered every one of them with the devotional purity required for entering into His association. Otherwise, He would have remained outside the scope of their power to see, as He Himself states in His instructions to Uddhava: *bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ.* “I can be perceived only by devotion.” (*Bhāg.* 11.14.21) By the grammatical rule of compound formation known as *eka-śeṣa,* the term *sta-vīkṣaṇa-vinaṣṭa-tamisra-dṛgbhyaḥ,* although in its primary sense inflected as a masculine noun, may be understood in this context as referring to both men and women.

### Translation

**Wanting to please them both, the Lord accepted both their invitations. Thus He simultaneously went to both homes, and neither could see Him entering the other’s house.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Kṛṣṇa visited Śrutadeva and Bahulāśva at the same time by manifesting Himself in duplicate forms, along with the sages. Thus King Bahulāśva thought that Lord Kṛṣṇa had come only to his house, leaving Śrutadeva to return home disappointed, while Śrutadeva believed that just the reverse was the case.

In *Kṛṣṇa,* Śrīla Prabhupāda remarks: “That \[Lord Kṛṣṇa\] and His companions were present in both houses, although both the *brāhmaṇa* and the King thought He was present in his house only, is another opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This opulence is described in the revealed scriptures as *vaibhava-prakāśa.* Similarly, when Lord Kṛṣṇa married sixteen thousand wives, He also expanded Himself into sixteen thousand forms, each one of them as powerful as He Himself. Similarly, in Vṛndāvana, when Brahmā stole away Kṛṣṇa’s cows, calves and cowherd boys, Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself into many new cows, calves and cowherd boys.”

### Translation

**When King Bahulāśva, a descendant of Janaka, saw Lord Kṛṣṇa approaching his house from a distance with the sages, who were somewhat fatigued from the journey, he immediately arranged to have seats of honor brought out for them. After they were all comfortably seated, the wise King, his heart overflowing with joy and his eyes clouded by tears, bowed down to them and washed their feet with intense devotion. Taking the wash water, which could purify the entire world, he sprinkled it on his head and the heads of his family members. Then he worshiped all those great lords by offering them fragrant sandalwood paste, flower garlands, fine clothing and ornaments, incense, lamps, arghya and cows and bulls.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “Bahulāśva, the King of Videha, was very intelligent and was a perfect gentleman. He was astonished that so many great sages, along with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were personally present in his home. He knew perfectly well that conditioned souls engaged in worldly affairs cannot be one-hundred-percent pure whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees are always transcendental to worldly contamination. Therefore, when he found that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and all the great sages were at his home, he was astonished, and he began to thank Lord Krsna for His causeless mercy.”

The word *īśvara* in this verse refers not only to the Supreme Lord but also to the exalted sages in His company; this is confirmed by Ācāryas Śrīdhara Svāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains Bahulāśva’s inner thoughts as follows: Bahulāśva glorifies Lord Kṛṣṇa as the inspiring Soul of all life and consciousness, thinking that even an inert dullard like himself could be awakened to devotional awareness by His mercy. He glorifies the Lord as the witness of all pious and impious actions, confident that the Lord remembers whatever little devotional service he has ever done. And he glorifies Him as self-illumined, never needing to be enlightened or informed by any external source, with the knowledge that the Lord has always been aware of Bahulāśva’s long-cherished secret desire to see Him.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that the King offered these prayers to encourage Lord Kṛṣṇa to remain at his home for some days. The King thought, “Since contact with the Supreme Lord can free anyone from misconceptions and doubts, Kṛṣṇa’s presence in my home will fortify my intelligence so that I can withstand the onslaughts of material desires. In His expansion as Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, the Lord always resides in Badarikāśrama for the good of the whole land of Bharata, and so He may also create good fortune for the land of Mithilā by remaining here for at least a few days. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa’s propensity is toward peace and simplicity, He will certainly prefer my simple home to the excessive opulence of Dvārakā.”

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *śayānaḥ* — sleeping; *puruṣaḥ* — a person; *manasā* — with his mind; *eva* — alone; *ātma* — own; *māyayā* — by his imagination; *sṛṣṭvā* — creating; *lokam* — a world; *param* — separate; *svāpnam* — dream; *anuviśya* — entering; *avabhāsate* — he appears.

### Translation

**The Lord is like a sleeping person who creates a separate world in his imagination and then enters his own dream and sees himself within it.**

### Purport

In the illusion of his dream, a sleeping person creates an apparent world, complete with cities populated by the fictional products of his imagination. In somewhat the same way, the Lord manifests the cosmos. Of course, the creation is not illusory for the Lord, but it is for those souls who are put under the control of His Māyā potency. As her service to the Lord, Māyā deludes the conditioned souls into accepting as real her temporary, insubstantial manifestations.

*hṛdi* — in the heart; *sthaḥ* — situated; *api* — although; *ati* — very; *dūra*-*sthaḥ* — far away; *karma* — by material activities; *vikṣipta* — disturbed; *cetasām* — for those whose minds; *ātma* — by one’s own; *śaktibhiḥ* — powers; *agrāhyaḥ* — not to be taken hold of; *api* — although; *anti* — near; *upeta* — realized; *guṇa* — Your qualities; *ātmanām* — by whose hearts.

### Translation

**But although You reside within the heart, You are very far away from those whose minds are disturbed by their entanglement in material work. Indeed, no one can grasp You by his material powers, for You reveal Yourself only in the hearts of those who have learned to appreciate Your transcendental qualities.**

### Purport

The all-merciful Lord is in everyone’s heart. Seeing Him there, however, is possible only when one’s heart is completely purified. Materialists may demand that God prove His existence by coming into view as a result of their empirical investigations, but God has no need to respond to such impudence. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.25):

*nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya  
yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ  
mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti  
loko mām ajam avyayam*

“I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.”

### Synonyms

*namaḥ* — obeisances; *astu* — may there be; *te* — unto You; *adhyātma* — the Absolute Truth; *vidām* — for those who know; *para*-*ātmane* — the Supreme Soul; *anātmane* — to the conditioned *jīva* soul; *sva*-*ātma* — from Yourself (in the form of time); *vibhakta* — who gives; *mṛtyave* — death; *sa*-*kāraṇa* — having a cause; *akāraṇa* — having no cause; *liṅgam* — the forms (respectively, the material form of the universe and also Your original spiritual form); *īyuṣe* — who assume; *sva*-*māyayā* — by Your own mystic potency; *asaṁvṛta* — uncovered; *ruddha* — and blocked; *dṛṣṭaye* — vision.

### Translation

**Let me offer my obeisances unto You. You are realized as the Supreme Soul by those who know the Absolute Truth, whereas in Your form of time You impose death upon the forgetful souls. You appear both in Your causeless spiritual form and in the created form of this universe, thus simultaneously uncovering the eyes of Your devotees and obstructing the vision of the nondevotees.**

### Purport

When the Lord appears before His devotees in His eternal, spiritual form, their eyes become “uncovered” in the sense that all vestiges of illusion are dispelled and they drink in the beautiful vision of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. For the nondevotees, on the other hand, the Lord “appears” as material nature, His universal form, and in this way He covers their vision so that His spiritual, personal form remains invisible to them.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives another interpretation of this verse, based on an alternative understanding of *anātmane,* a form of the word *anātmā:* Various classes of men know the Absolute Truth in different ways. The devotees of the Lord who are in the reciprocal mood of neutral admiration (*śānta-rasa*) meditate on the Supreme as possessing a divine, personal form (*ātmā* or *śrī-vigraha*) transcending all aspects of material illusion. The impersonal philosophers (*jñānīs*) conceive of Him as formless (*anātmā*). And the envious demons see Him in the form of death.

### Translation

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: After hearing Śrutadeva speak these words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who relieves His surrendered devotees’ distress, took Śrutadeva’s hand in His own and, smiling, spoke to him as follows.**

### Purport

Ācārya Viśvanātha comments that Lord Kṛṣṇa took Śrutadeva’s hand and smiled as a gesture of friendship, to tell Him, “Yes, you know the truth about Me, and I also know all about you. So now I will tell you something special.”

### Translation

**The Supreme Lord said: My dear brāhmaṇa, you should know that these great sages have come here just to bless you. They travel throughout the worlds with Me, purifying them with the dust of their feet.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that Lord Kṛṣṇa thought Śrutadeva had shown too much reverence to Him and not enough to the sages, and thus He turned the *brāhmaṇa’s* attention to them.

### Translation

**One can gradually become purified by seeing, touching and worshiping temple deities, places of pilgrimage and holy rivers. But one can attain the same result immediately simply by receiving the glance of exalted sages.**

### Purport

Rather than remaining in seclusion and concentrating on their own perfection, Vaiṣṇava *brāhmaṇas* of the highest order dedicate their lives to sharing the benediction of the Lord’s devotional service. In the words of the sons of King Prācīnabarhi:

*teṣāṁ vicaratāṁ padbhyāṁ  
tīrthānāṁ pāvanecchayā  
bhītasya kiṁ na roceta  
tāvakānāṁ samāgamaḥ*

“Dear Lord, Your personal associates, Your devotees, wander all over the world to purify even the holy places of pilgrimage. Is not such activity pleasing to those who are actually afraid of material existence?” (*Bhāg.* 4.30.37) And Prahlāda Mahārāja says:

*prāyeṇa deva munayaḥ sva-vimukti-kāmā  
maunaṁ caranti vijane na parārtha-niṣṭhāḥ  
naitān vihāya kṛpaṇān vimumukṣa eko  
nānyaṁ tvad asya śaraṇam bhramato ’nupaśye*

“My dear Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested only in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Himālayas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence \*mauna-vrata*\]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.” ([*Bhāg.* 7.9.44)

### Translation

**Even My own four-armed form is no dearer to Me than a brāhmaṇa. Within himself a learned brāhmaṇa comprises all the Vedas, just as within Myself I comprise all the demigods.**

### Purport

It is understood from the Vedic science of epistemology, the *Nyāya-śāstra,* that knowledge of an object (*prameya*) depends on a valid means of knowing (*pramāṇa*). The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be known only by means of the *Vedas,* and thus He relies on the *brāhmaṇa* sages, who are the *Vedas* personified, to reveal Him in this world. Even though Lord Kṛṣṇa embodies all the demigods and *viṣṇu-tattva* expansions of Nārāyaṇa, He considers Himself obliged to the *brāhmaṇas.*

**Ignorant of this truth, foolish people neglect and enviously offend a learned brāhmaṇa, who, being nondifferent from Me, is their spiritual master and very self. They consider worshipable only such obvious manifestations of divinity as My Deity form.**

### Purport

In his narration of this pastime in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda concludes: “The instruction we receive from this incident is that King Bahulāśva and Śrutadeva the *brāhmaṇa* were accepted by the Lord on the same level because both were pure devotees. This is the real qualification for being recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because it has become the fashion of this age to become falsely proud of having taken birth in the family of a *kṣatriya* or a *brāhmaṇa,* we see persons without any qualification claiming to be *brāhmaṇa* or *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya.* But as it is stated in the scriptures, *kalau śūdra-sambhava:* ‘In this Age of Kali, everyone is born a *śūdra.*’ This is because there is no performance of the purificatory process known as *saṁskāras,* which begin from the time of the mother’s pregnancy and continue up to the point of the individual’s death. No one can be classified as a member of a particular caste, especially of a higher caste — *brāhmaṇa,* *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* — simply by birthright. If one is not purified by the process of the seed-giving ceremony, or *garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,* he is immediately classified among the *śūdras* because only the *śūdras* do not undergo this purificatory process. Sex life without the purificatory process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is merely the seed-giving process of the *śūdras* or the animals. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest perfection, by which everyone can come to the platform of a Vaiṣṇava. This includes having all the qualifications of a *brāhmaṇa.* The Vaiṣṇavas are trained to become freed from the four kinds of sinful activities — illicit sex, indulgence in intoxicants, gambling and eating animal foodstuffs. No one can be on the brahminical platform without having these preliminary qualifications, and without becoming a qualified *brāhmaṇa,* one cannot become a pure devotee.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Eighty-sixth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Arjuna Kidnaps Subhadrā, and Kṛṣṇa Blesses His Devotees.”*
