CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE

This chapter lists Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s sons, grandsons and other progeny. It also describes how Lord Balarāma killed Rukmī at Aniruddha’s marriage ceremony and how Lord Kṛṣṇa arranged for His sons and daughters to be married.

Not understanding the full truth about Śrī Kṛṣṇa, each of His wives thought that since He remained constantly in her palace she must be His favorite wife. They were all entranced by the Lord’s beauty and His loving conversations with them, but they could not agitate His mind with the charming gestures of their eyebrows or by any other means. Having attained as their husband Lord Kṛṣṇa, whom even demigods like Brahmā find it difficult to know in truth, the Lord’s queens were always eager to associate with Him. Thus, although each of them had hundreds of maidservants, they would personally render Him menial service.

Each of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives had ten sons, who in turn each fathered many sons and grandsons. In the womb of Rukmī’s daughter Rukmavatī, Pradyumna fathered Aniruddha. Though Śrī Kṛṣṇa had disrespected Rukmī, to please his sister Rukmī gave his daughter in marriage to Pradyumna, and his granddaughter to Aniruddha. Balī, the son of Kṛtavarmā, married Rukmiṇī’s daughter Cārumatī.

At Aniruddha’s wedding, Lord Baladeva, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and other Yādavas went to Rukmī’s palace in the city of Bhojakaṭa. After the ceremony, Rukmī challenged Lord Baladeva to a game of dice. In the first match Rukmī defeated Baladeva, whereupon the King of Kaliṅga laughed at the Lord, displaying all his teeth. Lord Baladeva won the next match, but Rukmī refused to concede defeat. A voice then spoke from the sky, announcing that Baladeva had in fact won. But Rukmī, encouraged by the wicked kings, offended Lord Baladeva by saying that while He was certainly expert at tending cows, He knew nothing of playing dice. Thus insulted, Lord Baladeva angrily struck Rukmī dead with His club. The King of Kaliṅga tried to flee, but Lord Baladeva seized him and knocked out all his teeth. Then the other offensive kings, their arms, thighs and heads wounded by Baladeva’s blows, fled in all directions, bleeding profusely. Śrī Kṛṣṇa expressed neither approval nor disapproval of His brother-in-law’s death, fearing He would jeopardize His loving ties with either Rukmiṇī or Baladeva.

Lord Baladeva and the other Yādavas then seated Aniruddha and His bride on a fine chariot, and they all set off for Dvārakā.

### Translation

**Rukmī gave his granddaughter Rocanā to his daughter’s son, Aniruddha, despite Rukmī’s relentless feud with Lord Hari. Although Rukmī considered this marriage irreligious, he wanted to please his sister, bound as he was by the ropes of affection.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that according to worldly standards one should not give one’s beloved granddaughter to the grandson of one’s bitter enemy. Thus we find the following injunction: *dviṣad-annaṁ na bhoktavyaṁ dviṣantaṁ naiva bhojayet.* “One should not eat an enemy’s food or feed an enemy.” There is also the following prohibition: *asvargyaṁ loka-vidviṣṭaṁ dharmam apy ācaren na tu.* “One should not execute religious injunctions if they will obstruct one’s journey to heaven, or if they are odious to human society.”

It should be pointed out here that Lord Kṛṣṇa is not really the enemy of anyone. As the Lord states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29), *suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati:* “One achieves peace by understanding that I am the well-wishing friend of every living being.” Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is everyone’s friend, Rukmī could not appreciate this fact and considered Lord Kṛṣṇa his enemy. Still, out of affection for his sister, he gave his granddaughter to Aniruddha.

Finally, we should note that, contrary to the prohibition quoted above, one may not give up the basic principles of spiritual life merely because such principles are unpopular with people in general. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Gītā* (18.66), *sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaranaṁ vraja.* The last word in spiritual duties is to surrender to the Supreme Lord, and that duty takes precedence over all secondary injunctions. Moreover, in this age Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has kindly presented a sublime process that will attract all sincere people to come to the point of surrendering to the Lord. By following Lord Caitanya’s blissful process of chanting, dancing, feasting and discussing spiritual philosophy, anyone can easily go back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge.

Still, someone may argue that the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should not practice in the Western countries those ceremonies or activities that displease people in general. We respond that even in the Western countries, when people are properly informed of the activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they generally appreciate this great spiritual institution. Those who are especially envious of God will not appreciate any type of religious movement, and since such persons are themselves little better than animals, they cannot impede the great Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, just as the envious Rukmī could not impede the performance of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pure pastimes.
