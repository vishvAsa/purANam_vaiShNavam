CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

This chapter describes how Kāliya left the island of the snakes and how the sleeping residents of Vṛndāvana were saved from a forest fire.

When King Parīkṣit inquired about Kāliya’s leaving Ramaṇaka Island, the abode of the serpents, and about why Garuḍa acted inimically toward him, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied as follows: All the serpents on the island were afraid of being devoured by Garuḍa. To placate him, every month they would leave various offerings for him at the foot of a banyan tree. But Kāliya, puffed-up as he was with false pride, would eat these offerings himself. Hearing of this, Garuḍa became furious and went to kill Kāliya, whereupon the snake began biting the great bird. Garuḍa fiercely beat him with his wing, sending Kāliya fleeing for his life to a lake adjoining the Yamunā River.

Prior to the above incident, Garuḍa had once come to the Yamunā and started eating some fish. Saubhari Ṛṣi had tried to stop him, but Garuḍa, agitated by hunger, had refused to heed the sage’s prohibitions, and in response the sage had cursed Garuḍa that if he ever came there again he would immediately die. Kāliya had heard of this, and thus he lived there without fear. In the end, however, he was driven out by Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

When Lord Balarāma and all the residents of Vṛndāvana saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa rise up out of the lake, beautifully decorated with many different gems and ornaments, they embraced Him in great pleasure. The spiritual masters, priests and learned *brāhmaṇas* then told Nanda Mahārāja, the king of the cowherds, that although his son had been caught in the grips of Kāliya, it was by the king’s good fortune that He was now free again.

Because the people of Vṛndāvana were quite worn out by hunger, thirst and fatigue, they spent that night on the banks of the Yamunā. In the middle of the night, a fire happened to blaze up within the forest, which had become dry during the hot season. As the fire surrounded the sleeping inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they suddenly awoke and rushed to Śrī Kṛṣṇa for protection. Then the unlimitedly powerful Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, seeing His dear relatives and friends so distressed, immediately swallowed up the terrible forest fire.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *upahāryaiḥ* — who were qualified to make offerings; *sarpa*-*janaiḥ* — by the serpent race; *māsi* *māsi* — each month; *iha* — here (in Nāgālaya); *yaḥ* — which; *baliḥ* — offering of tribute; *vānaspatyaḥ* — at the base of a tree; *mahā*-*bāho* — O mighty-armed Parīkṣit; *nāgānām* — for the serpents; *prāk* — previously; *nirūpitaḥ* — ordained; *svam* *svam* — each his own; *bhāgam* — portion; *prayacchanti* — they present; *nāgāḥ* — the serpents; *parvaṇi* *parvaṇi* — once each month; *gopīthāya* — for the protection; *ātmanaḥ* — of themselves; *sarve* — all of them; *suparṇāya* — to Garuḍa; *mahā*-*ātmane* — the powerful.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: To avoid being eaten by Garuḍa, the serpents had previously made an arrangement with him whereby they would each make a monthly offering of tribute at the base of a tree. Thus every month on schedule, O mighty-armed King Parīkṣit, each serpent would duly make his offering to that powerful carrier of Viṣṇu as a purchase of protection.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has given an alternate explanation of this verse. *Upahāryaiḥ* may also be translated as “by those who are to be eaten,” and *sarpa-janaiḥ* as “those human beings who were dominated by or who belonged to the serpent race.” According to this reading, a group of human beings had fallen under the control of the serpents and were prone to be eaten by them. To avoid this, the human beings would make a monthly offering to the serpents, who in turn would offer a portion of that offering to Garuḍa so that *he* would not eat *them.* The particular translation given above is based on the commentary of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and the translation by Śrīla Prabhupāda in his *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.* In any case, all the *ācāryas* agree that the serpents purchased protection from Garuḍa.

*viṣa-vīrya-madāviṣṭaḥ  
kādraveyas tu kāliyaḥ  
kadarthī-kṛtya garuḍaṁ  
svayaṁ taṁ bubhuje balim*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Although all the other serpents were dutifully making offerings to Garuḍa, one serpent — the arrogant Kāliya, son of Kadru — would eat all these offerings before Garuḍa could claim them. Thus Kāliya directly defied the carrier of Lord Viṣṇu.**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain that Kāliya used his weapon of poison at a distance by spitting venom upon his enemy and at short range by biting him with his terrible fangs.

### Devanagari

तत्रैकदा जलचरं गरुडो भक्ष्यमीप्सितम् ।

### Verse text

*tatraikadā jala-caraṁ  
garuḍo bhakṣyam īpsitam  
nivāritaḥ saubhariṇā  
prasahya kṣudhito ’harat*

### Synonyms

*tatra* — there (in that lake); *ekadā* — once; *jala*-*caram* — an aquatic creature; *garuḍaḥ* — Garuḍa; *bhakṣyam* — his proper food; *īpsitam* — desired; *nivāritaḥ* — forbidden; *saubhariṇā* — by Saubhari Muni; *prasahya* — taking courage; *kṣudhitaḥ* — feeling hunger; *aharat* — he took.

### Translation

**In that very lake Garuḍa had once desired to eat a fish — fish being, after all, his normal food. Although forbidden by the sage Saubhari, who was meditating there within the water, Garuḍa took courage and, feeling hungry, seized the fish.**

### Purport

Śukadeva Gosvāmī is now explaining why Garuḍa could not approach the lake in the Yamunā River. It is the nature of birds to eat fish, and thus, by the arrangement of the Lord, the great bird Garuḍa does not commit any offense by nourishing himself with fish. On the other hand, Saubhari Muni’s forbidding a much greater personality to eat his normal food did constitute an offense. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Saubhari committed two offenses: first, he dared to give an order to a supremely exalted soul like Garuḍa, and second, he obstructed Garuḍa from satisfying his desire.

*mīnān su-duḥkhitān dṛṣṭvā  
dīnān mīna-patau hate  
kṛpayā saubhariḥ prāha  
tatratya-kṣemam ācaran*

### Synonyms

*mīnān* — the fish; *su*-*duḥkhitān* — most unhappy; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *dīnān* — wretched; *mīna*-*patau* — the lord of the fish; *hate* — being killed; *kṛpayā* — out of compassion; *saubhariḥ* — Saubhari; *prāha* — spoke; *tatratya* — for those living there; *kṣemam* — the welfare; *ācaran* — trying to enact.

### Translation

**Seeing how the unfortunate fish in that lake had become most unhappy at the death of their leader, Saubhari uttered the following curse under the impression that he was mercifully acting for the benefit of the lake’s residents.**

### Purport

In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that when our so-called compassion does not tally with the order of the Supreme Lord, it merely causes a disturbance. Because Saubhari had forbidden Garuḍa’s coming to that lake, Kāliya moved in and made his headquarters there, and this spelled doom for all the lake’s residents.

### Verse text

*atra praviśya garuḍo  
yadi matsyān sa khādati  
sadyaḥ prāṇair viyujyeta  
satyam etad bravīmy aham*

### Synonyms

*atra* — in this lake; *praviśya* — entering; *garuḍaḥ* — Garuḍa; *yadi* — if; *matsyān* — the fish; *saḥ* — he; *khādati* — eats; *sadyaḥ* — immediately; *prāṇaiḥ* — of his force of life; *viyujyeta* — will become deprived; *satyam* — truthfully; *etat* — this; *bravīmi* — am speaking; *aham* — I.

### Translation

**If Garuḍa ever again enters this lake and eats the fish here, he will immediately lose his life. What I am saying is the truth.**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain in this regard that because of Saubhari Muni’s material attachment and affection for a fish, he failed to see the situation from the spiritual viewpoint. The Ninth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* describes his falldown for this offense. Because of false pride, Saubhari Muni lost his power of austerity, and with it his spiritual beauty and happiness. When Garuḍa came to the Yamunā, Saubhari Muni thought, “Although he may be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, I will still curse him and even kill him if he disobeys my order.” Such an offensive attitude against an exalted Vaiṣṇava will certainly destroy one’s auspicious position in life.

As the Ninth Canto describes, Saubhari Muni married many beautiful women, and suffered greatly in their association. But because he had once become glorious by taking shelter of the Yamunā River in Śrī Vṛndāvana, he was ultimately delivered.

### Translation

**\[Resuming his description of Kṛṣṇa’s chastisement of Kāliya, Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Kṛṣṇa rose up out of the lake wearing divine garlands, fragrances and garments, covered with many fine jewels, and decorated with gold. When the cowherds saw Him they all stood up immediately, just like an unconscious person’s senses coming back to life. Filled with great joy, they affectionately embraced Him.**

**O best of kings \[Parīkṣit\], because the residents of Vṛndāvana were feeling very weak from hunger, thirst and fatigue, they and the cows spent the night where they were, lying down near the bank of the Kālindī.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out that although the people were weak from hunger and thirst, they did not drink the milk from the cows present there because they feared it had been contaminated by the serpent’s poison. The residents of Vṛndāvana were so overjoyed to get back their beloved Kṛṣṇa that they did not want to go back to their houses. They wanted to stay with Kṛṣṇa on the bank of the Yamunā so that they could continuously see Him. Thus they decided to take rest near the riverbank.

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura have commented that perhaps a loyal friend of Kāliya had assumed the form of a forest fire to avenge his friend, or perhaps the forest fire was manifest by a demon who was a follower of Kaṁsa’s.

तत उत्थाय सम्भ्रान्ता दह्यमाना व्रजौकस- ।  
कृष्णं ययुस्ते शरणं मायामनुजमीश्वरम् ॥ २२ ॥

### Verse text

*tata utthāya sambhrāntā  
dahyamānā vrajaukasaḥ  
kṛṣṇaṁ yayus te śaraṇaṁ  
māyā-manujam īśvaram*

### Synonyms

*tataḥ* — then; *utthāya* — waking up; *sambhrāntāḥ* — agitated; *dahyamānāḥ* — about to be burned; *vraja*-*okasaḥ* — the people of Vraja; *kṛṣṇam* — to Kṛṣṇa; *yayuḥ* — went; *te* — they; *śaraṇam* — for shelter; *māyā* — by His potency; *manujam* — appearing like a human being; *īśvaram* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Then the residents of Vṛndāvana woke up, extremely disturbed by the great fire threatening to burn them. Thus they took shelter of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, who by His spiritual potency appeared like an ordinary human being.**

### Purport

The *śruti,* or Vedic *mantras,* state, *svarūpa-bhūtayā nitya-śaktyā māyākhyayā*: “The Lord’s eternal potency named *māyā* is innate in His original form.” Thus within the eternal spiritual body of the Supreme Lord there is infinite potency, which effortlessly manipulates all existence according to the omniscient desire of the Absolute Truth. The residents of Vṛndāvana took shelter of Kṛṣṇa, thinking, “This blessed boy will certainly be empowered by God to save us.” They remembered the words of the sage Garga Muni, spoken at the birth ceremony of Lord Kṛṣṇa: *anena sarva-durgāṇi yūyam añjas tariṣyatha.* “By His power you will easily be able to cross over all obstacles.” (*Bhāg.* 10.8.16) Therefore the residents of Vṛndāvana, who had full faith in Kṛṣṇa, took shelter of the Lord in hopes of being saved from the impending disaster threatened by the forest fire.
