CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX

This chapter describes how Kṛṣṇa killed Ariṣṭāsura and how Kaṁsa reacted when he learned from Nārada that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were the sons of Vasudeva.

The demon Ariṣṭa wanted to kill Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, and thus he assumed the form of a huge bull with sharp horns. Everyone in Kṛṣṇa’s cowherd village became terrified when Ariṣṭāsura approached it, but the Lord pacified them, and when the bull demon charged Him He seized him by the horns and threw him about six yards. Though weakened, Ariṣṭa still wanted to attack Kṛṣṇa. Thus, dripping with sweat, he charged the Lord once again. This time Kṛṣṇa grabbed his horns, threw him to the ground and thrashed him like a pile of wet clothing. The demon vomited blood and gave up his life. Then Kṛṣṇa and Rāma, while being honored by the demigods and cowherd boys, returned to the village.

A short time later Nārada Muni, the great sage among the demigods, came to see King Kaṁsa. He informed the King that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were not Nanda’s sons but rather Vasudeva’s. It was out of fear of Kaṁsa that Vasudeva had put the two boys under Nanda’s care. Furthermore, said Nārada, Kaṁsa would meet his death at Their hands.

Kaṁsa shook with fear and anger when he heard all this, and in great agitation he began thinking of how to destroy Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. He called for the demons Cāṇūra and Muṣṭika and instructed them to kill the two brothers in a wrestling match. Then he spoke to Akrūra, who was expert at executing his duties. Taking Akrūra by the hand, Kaṁsa persuaded him to go to Vraja to bring the two boys to Mathurā. Akrūra agreed to carry out Kaṁsa’s order and then returned home.

### Translation

### Purport

This verse exemplifies the sublime contrast of spiritual qualities within Śrī Kṛṣṇa. In one four-line verse we simultaneously learn that Lord Kṛṣṇa killed a powerful and wicked demon and that His boyish beauty gave festive pleasure to His young girlfriends. Lord Kṛṣṇa is as hard as a thunderbolt or as soft as a rose, depending on our attitude toward Him. The demon Ariṣṭa wanted to kill Kṛṣṇa and all His friends, so the Lord beat him into a wet rag and killed him. The *gopīs,* however, loved Kṛṣṇa, and thus the Lord boyishly reciprocated their conjugal feelings.

अरिष्टे निहते दैत्ये कृष्णेनाद्भ‍ुतकर्मणा ।  
कंसायाथाह भगवान् नारदो देवदर्शन- ॥ १६ ॥

### Verse text

*ariṣṭe nihate daitye  
kṛṣṇenādbhuta-karmaṇā  
kaṁsāyāthāha bhagavān  
nārado deva-darśanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*ariṣṭe* — Ariṣṭa; *nihate* — having been killed; *daitye* — the demon; *kṛṣṇena* — by Kṛṣṇa; *adbhuta*-*karmaṇā* — whose activities are wonderful; *kaṁsāya* — to Kaṁsa; *atha* — then; *āha* — spoke; *bhagavān* — the powerful sage; *nāradaḥ* — Nārada; *deva*-*darśanaḥ* — whose vision is godly.

### Translation

**After Ariṣṭāsura had been killed by Kṛṣṇa, who acts wonderfully, Nārada Muni went to speak to King Kaṁsa. That powerful sage of godly vision addressed the King as follows.**

### Purport

The term *deva-darśana* can be understood in many ways, all of which are consistent with the context and purport of this narration. *Deva* means “God,” and *darśanaḥ* means “seeing” or “an audience with a great personality.” Thus *deva-darśana,* a name for Nārada Muni, indicates that Nārada has attained the perfection of seeing God, that getting Nārada’s audience is as good as getting God’s (since Nārada is a pure representative of the Lord), and also that Nārada’s audience is as good as that of the demigods, who are also known as *devas.* That there are all these meanings of the term *deva-darśanaḥ* reveals something of the richness of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam’s* language.

From the *Purāṇas,* Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has quoted twenty verses describing a joking conversation between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa that took place after Kṛṣṇa had killed the demon Ariṣṭa. This conversation, so kindly quoted by the *ācārya,* describes the origin of Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa, Rādhā’s and Kṛṣṇa’s bathing ponds. The verses are as follows:

*māsmān spṛśādya vṛṣabhārdana hanta mugdhā  
ghoro ’suro ’yam ayi kṛṣṇa tad apy ayaṁ gauḥ  
vṛtro yathā dvija ihāsty ayi niṣkṛtiḥ kiṁ  
śudhyed bhavāṁs tri-bhuvana-sthita-tīrtha-kṛcchrāt*

“The innocent young *gopīs* said, ‘Ah, Kṛṣṇa, don’t touch us now, O killer of a bull! Alas, even though Ariṣṭa was a terrible demon, still he was a male cow, so You will have to undergo atonement, just as Lord Indra did after killing Vṛtrāsura. But how can You purify Yourself without going to the trouble of visiting every single holy place in the three worlds?’”

*kiṁ paryaṭāmi bhuvanāny adhunaiva sarvā  
ānīya tīrtha-vitatīḥ karavāṇi tāsu  
snānaṁ vilokayata tāvad idaṁ mukundaḥ  
procyaiva tatra kṛtavān bata pārṣṇi-ghātam*

“\[Kṛṣṇa replied,\] ‘Why should I have to wander throughout the entire universe? I will at once bring all the countless pilgrimage places here and take My bath in them. Just watch!’ With this, Lord Mukunda struck His heel on the ground.”

*pātālato jalam idaṁ kila bhogavatyā  
āyātam atra nikhilā api tīrtha-saṅghāḥ  
āgacchateti bhagavad-vacasā ta etya  
tatraiva rejur atha kṛṣṇa uvāca gopīḥ*

“\[Then He said,\] ‘This is the water of the Bhogavatī River, coming from the Pātāla region. And now, O holy places, all of you please come here!’ When the Supreme Lord had spoken these words, all the holy places went there and appeared before Him. Kṛṣṇa then addressed the *gopīs* as follows.”

*tīrthāni paśyata harer vacasā tavaivaṁ  
naiva pratīma iti tā atha tīrtha-varyāḥ  
procuḥ kṛtāñjali-puṭā lavaṇābdhir asmi  
kṣīrābdhir asmi śṛṇutāmara-dīrghikāsmi*

“‘See all the holy places!’

“But the *gopīs* replied, ‘We don’t see them as You describe.’

“Then those best of holy places, joining their palms in supplication, spoke up:

“‘I am the salt ocean.’

“‘I am the Ocean of Milk.’

“‘I am the Amara-dīrghikā.’”

*śoṇo ’pi sindhur aham asmi bhavāmi tāmra-  
parṇī ca puṣkaram ahaṁ ca sarasvatī ca  
godāvarī ravi-sutā sarayuḥ prayāgo  
revāsmi paśyata jalaṁ kuruta pratītim*

“‘I am the river Śoṇa.’

“‘I am the Sindhu.’

“‘I am the Tāmraparṇī.’

“‘I am the holy place Puṣkara.’

“‘I am the river Sarasvatī.’

“‘And we are the Godāvarī, Yamunā and Revā rivers and the confluence of rivers at Prayāga. Just see our waters!’”

*snātvā tato harir ati-prajagalbha eva  
śuddhaḥ saro ’py akaravaṁ sthita-sarva-tīrtham  
yuṣmābhir ātma-januṣīha kṛto na dharmaḥ  
ko ’pi kṣitāv atha sakhīr nijagāda rādhā*

“After purifying Himself by bathing, Lord Hari became quite arrogant and said, ‘I have produced a pond containing all the various holy places, whereas you *gopīs* must never have executed any religious duties on this earth for the pleasure of Lord Brahmā.’ Then Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī addressed Her girlfriends as follows.”

*kāryaṁ mayāpy ati-manohara-kuṇḍam ekaṁ  
tasmād yatadhvam iti tad-vacanena tābhiḥ  
śrī-kṛṣṇa-kuṇḍa-taṭa-paścima-diśya-mando  
gartaḥ kṛto vṛṣabha-daitya-khurair vyaloki*

“‘I must create an even more beautiful pond. So go to work!’ Having heard these words, the *gopīs* saw that Ariṣṭāsura’s hooves had dug a shallow ditch just west of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pond.”

*tatrārdra-mṛn-mṛdula-gola-tatīḥ prati-sva-  
hastoddhṛtā anati-dūra-gatā vidhāya  
divyaṁ saraḥ prakaṭitaṁ ghaṭikā-dvayena  
tābhir vilokya sarasaṁ smarate sma kṛṣṇaḥ*

“At that nearby spot, all the *gopīs* began digging up lumps of soft mud with their hands, and in this way a divine pond manifested in the short span of an hour. Kṛṣṇa was astonished to see the lake they produced.”

*proce ca tīrtha-salilaiḥ paripūrayaitan  
mat-kuṇḍataḥ sarasijākṣi sahālibhis tvam  
rādhā tadā na na na neti jagāda yasmāt  
tvat-kuṇḍa-nīram uru-go-vadha-pātakāktam*

“He said, ‘Go ahead, lotus-eyed one. You and Your companions should fill this pond with water from Mine.’

“But Rādhā replied, ‘No, no, no, no! This is impossible, since the water of Your pond is contaminated by Your terrible sin of killing a cow.’”

*āhṛtya puṇya-salilaṁ śata-koṭi-kumbhaiḥ  
sakhy-arbudena saha mānasa-jāhnavītaḥ  
etat saraḥ sva-madhunā paripūrayāmi

“‘I will have My countless *gopī* companions bring the pure water of the Mānasa-gaṅgā here in billions of pots. In this way I will fill this lake with My own water and thus make its renown unequaled in the entire world.’”

“Lord Kṛṣṇa then gestured to a heavenly personality who was an intimate associate of all the holy places. Suddenly that person rose up out of Kṛṣṇa’s pond and bowed down to the daughter of Śrī Vṛṣabhānu \[Rādhārāṇī\]. Then, with palms joined and tears pouring from his eyes, he began praying to Her in devotion.”

*devi tvadīya-mahimānam avaiti sarva

kintv eka eva puruṣārtha-śiromaṇis tvat-

“‘O goddess, even Lord Brahmā himself, the knower of all scriptures, cannot understand Your glories, nor can Lord Śiva or Lakṣmī. Only Kṛṣṇa, the supreme goal of all human endeavor, can understand them, and thus He feels obliged to personally make sure that You can wash away Your perspiration when You are fatigued.’”

“‘He is always anointing Your lotus feet with nectarean *cāru* and *yāvaka* and decorating them with ankle bells, and He rejoices and feels most fortunate simply by satisfying the tips of the toes of Your lotus feet. On His order we have immediately come here to live in this most excellent pond, which He created by one stroke of His heel. But only if You now feel satisfied with us and bestow upon us Your merciful glance will the tree of our desire bear fruit.’”

*śrutvā stutiṁ nikhila-tīrtha-gaṇasya tuṣṭā  
prāha sma tarṣam ayi vedayateti rādhā

“Hearing this prayer spoken by the representative of the full assembly of holy places, Śrī Rādhā was pleased and said, ‘So, kindly tell Me your desire.’

“They then told Her plainly, ‘Our lives would be successful if we could come to Your pond. That is the benediction we desire.’”

*āgacchateti vṛṣabhānu-sutā smitāsyā

“Glancing at Her beloved from the corners of Her eyes, the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu replied with a smile, ‘Please come.’ Her *gopī* companions all agreed with Her decision and became immersed in the ocean of happiness. Indeed, the beauty of all creatures, both mobile and stationary, was enhanced.”

*prāpya prasādam atha te vṛṣabhānujāyāḥ

“Thus gaining the grace of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the holy rivers and lakes in Śrī Kṛṣṇa-kuṇḍa forcibly broke through its boundary walls and swiftly filled Rādhā-kuṇḍa with their waters.”

*proce hariḥ priyatame tava kuṇḍam etan  
mat-kuṇḍato ’pi mahimādhikam astu loke  
atraiva me salila-kelir ihaiva nityaṁ  
snānaṁ yathā tvam asi tadvad idaṁ saro me*

“Lord Hari then said, ‘My dear Rādhā, may this pond of Yours become even more world-renowned than Mine. I will always come here to bathe and to enjoy My water pastimes. Indeed, this lake is as dear to Me as You are.’”

*rādhābravīd aham api sva-sakhībhir etya

yo ’riṣṭa-mardana-sarasy uru-bhaktir atra  
snāyād vasen mama sa eva mahā-priyo ’stu*

“Rādhā replied, ‘I will come to bathe in Your pond as well, even though You may kill hundreds of Ariṣṭa demons here. In the future, anyone who has intense devotion for this lake, which is on the spot where You chastised Ariṣṭāsura, and who bathes or resides here is sure to become very dear to Me.’”

*rāsotsavaṁ prakurute sma ca tatra rātrau  
kṛṣṇāmbudaḥ kṛta-mahā-rasa-harṣa-varṣaḥ  
śrī-rādhikā-pravara-vidyud alaṅkṛta-śrīs  
trailokya-madhya-vitatī-kṛta-divya-kīrtiḥ*

“That night Lord Kṛṣṇa initiated a *rāsa* dance at Rādhā-kuṇḍa, generating a torrent of the greatest mood of splendorous pleasure. Śrī Kṛṣṇa resembled a cloud, and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī a brilliant flash of lightning filling the sky with abundant beauty. In this way Their divine glories permeated the expanses of the three worlds.”

As a final note, it should be mentioned that Nārada Muni, being a great sage, understood that the killing of Ariṣṭa more or less concluded the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana. Therefore Nārada, anxious to facilitate the transferal of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes to Mathurā, approached Kaṁsa and addressed him as follows.

### Synonyms

*yaśodāyāḥ* — of Yaśodā; *sutām* — the daughter; *kanyām* — the female child; *devakyāḥ* — of Devakī; *kṛṣṇam* — Kṛṣṇa; *eva* *ca* — also; *rāmam* — Balarāma; *ca* — and; *rohiṇī*-*putram* — the son of Rohiṇī; *vasudevena* — by Vasudeva; *bibhyatā* — who was afraid; *nyastau* — placed; *sva*-*mitre* — with his friend; *nande* — Nanda Mahārāja; *vai* — indeed; *yābhyām* — by which two; *te* — your; *puruṣāḥ* — men; *hatāḥ* — have been killed.

### Translation

**\[Nārada told Kaṁsa:\] Yaśodā’s child was actually a daughter, and Kṛṣṇa is the son of Devakī. Also, Rāma is the son of Rohiṇī. Out of fear, Vasudeva entrusted Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to his friend Nanda Mahārāja, and it is these two boys who have killed your men.**

### Purport

Kaṁsa had been led to believe that Kṛṣṇa was the son of Yaśodā and that Devakī’s eighth child had been a daughter. The identity of Devakī’s eighth child was extremely important to Kaṁsa because a prophecy had foretold that her eighth child would kill him. Here Nārada informs the King that the eighth child of Devakī was the formidable Kṛṣṇa, thus implying that the prophecy should be taken very seriously. Having received this information, Kaṁsa obviously will now do everything in his power to kill Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.

### Translation

**But Nārada restrained Kaṁsa by reminding him that it was the two sons of Vasudeva who would cause his death. Kaṁsa then had Vasudeva and his wife shackled in iron chains.**

### Purport

Kaṁsa realized that there was no use in killing Vasudeva, since it was Vasudeva’s sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, who were to kill him. According to the *ācāryas,* Nārada also advised Kaṁsa that if he killed Vasudeva the two young boys might flee and that it was therefore better not to kill him. Rather, Nārada recommended, Kaṁsa should bring Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to Kaṁsa’s capital city, Mathurā.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that Nārada did not act inimically toward the great devotees Vasudeva and Devakī when he revealed this information to Kaṁsa. In fact, as explained in the Eleventh Canto, Vasudeva was grateful to Nārada because he was arranging for Kaṁsa’s death at Kṛṣṇa’s hands, and further arranging for Kṛṣṇa to come and live in Mathurā, where His loving father could associate with Him.

Kaṁsa thought that since Akrūra was innocent by nature, when he saw this fine, new vehicle he would naturally want to drive it and quickly bring the two boys back. But the actual reason Akrūra went on a new chariot was that it would have been clearly inappropriate for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to mount a chariot that had already been enjoyed by the wicked Kaṁsa.”
