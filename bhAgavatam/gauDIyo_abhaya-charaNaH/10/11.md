CHAPTER ELEVEN

This chapter describes how the inhabitants of Gokula left Gokula and went to Vṛndāvana and how Kṛṣṇa killed Vatsāsura and Bakāsura.

When the *yamala-arjuna* trees fell, they made a tremendous sound, like that of falling thunderbolts. Being surprised, Kṛṣṇa’s father, Nanda, and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they saw the fallen trees and Kṛṣṇa standing between them, bound to the *ulūkhala,* the wooden mortar. They could find no cause for the trees’ having fallen and Kṛṣṇa’s being there. They thought this might be the work of some other *asura* who had met Kṛṣṇa on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of Kṛṣṇa about how the whole incident had taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many wonderful incidents in connection with Kṛṣṇa. Anyway, Nanda Mahārāja immediately released Kṛṣṇa from the ropes.

In this way, Kṛṣṇa, at every day and every moment, displayed wonderful incidents to increase the parental affection of Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the *yamala-arjunas* was one of these wonderful pastimes.

One day a fruit vendor approached Nanda Mahārāja’s house, and Kṛṣṇa gathered some food grains with His little palms and went to the vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains fell from His palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in exchange for as much fruit as Kṛṣṇa could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and jewels.

Thereafter, all the elderly *gopas* decided to leave Gokula because they saw that in Gokula there was always some disturbance. They decided to go to Vṛndāvana, Vraja-dhāma, and the next day they all departed. In Vṛndāvana, both Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send them to the pasturing grounds (*go-caraṇa*). During this time, a demon named Vatsāsura entered among the calves and was killed, and another *asura,* in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Kṛṣṇa narrated all these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, Kṛṣṇa’s playmates, but because of full affection they enjoyed these narrations of Kṛṣṇa’s activities.

### Purport

Considering all the circumstances, had this been done by Kṛṣṇa? He was standing on the spot, and His playmates described that this had been done by Him. Had Kṛṣṇa actually done this, or were these merely stories? This was a cause of bewilderment.

### Purport

The cowherd men were very much agitated because the child Kṛṣṇa, after all, had been standing between the two trees, and if by chance the trees had fallen upon Him, He would have been smashed. But He was standing as He was, and still the things had happened, so who had done all this? How could these events have happened in such a wonderful way? These considerations were some of the reasons they were agitated and bewildered. They thought, however, that by chance Kṛṣṇa had been saved by God so that nothing had happened to Him.

### Purport

Kṛṣṇa’s playmates wanted to inform Kṛṣṇa’s father of the exact situation by explaining that not only did the trees break, but out of the broken trees came two beautiful men. “All these things happened,” they said. “We have seen them with our own eyes.”

### Translation

**Because of intense paternal affection, the cowherd men, headed by Nanda, could not believe that Kṛṣṇa could have uprooted the trees in such a wonderful way. Therefore they could not put their faith in the words of the boys. Some of the men, however, were in doubt. “Since Kṛṣṇa was predicted to equal Nārāyaṇa,” they thought, “it might be that He could have done it.”**

### Purport

One view was that it was impossible for a small boy like this to have done such a thing as pulling down the trees. But there were doubts because Kṛṣṇa had been predicted to equal Nārāyaṇa. Therefore the cowherd men were in a dilemma.

How then could she have been so cruel as to bind Him to the wooden mortar? Nanda Mahārāja understood this exchange of love, and therefore he smiled and released Kṛṣṇa. In other words, as Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, binds a living entity in fruitive activities, He binds mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja in parental affection. This is His pastime.

Sometimes He would sing very loudly, at their bidding. In this way, Kṛṣṇa came completely under the control of the gopīs.**

Sometimes, however, as if unable to raise these things, He would touch them and stand there. Just to invite the pleasure of His relatives, He would strike His body with His arms to show that He had sufficient strength.**

### Purport

That Kṛṣṇa performed childhood activities to increase the pleasure of His devotees was another transcendental humor. He exhibited these activities not only to the inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi, but also to others, who were captivated by His external potency and opulence. Both the internal devotees, who were simply absorbed in love of Kṛṣṇa, and the external devotees, who were captivated by His unlimited potency, were informed of Kṛṣṇa’s desire to be submissive to His servants.

फलविक्रयिणी तस्य च्युतधान्यकरद्वयम् ।

### Verse text

*phala-vikrayiṇī tasya  
cyuta-dhānya-kara-dvayam  
phalair apūrayad ratnaiḥ  
phala-bhāṇḍam apūri ca*

### Synonyms

*phala*-*vikrayiṇī* — the aborigine fruit vendor, who was an elderly woman; *tasya* — of Kṛṣṇa; *cyuta*-*dhānya* — the paddy He brought to barter having mostly fallen; *kara*-*dvayam* — palms of the hands; *phalaiḥ* *apūrayat* — the fruit vendor filled His small palms with fruits; *ratnaiḥ* — in exchange for jewels and gold; *phala*-*bhāṇḍam* — the basket of fruit; *apūri* *ca* — filled.

### Translation

**While Kṛṣṇa was going to the fruit vendor very hastily, most of the grains He was holding fell. Nonetheless, the fruit vendor filled Kṛṣṇa’s hands with fruits, and her fruit basket was immediately filled with jewels and gold.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26) Kṛṣṇa says:

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ  
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam  
aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

Kṛṣṇa is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some water, He will immediately accept it. The only condition is that these things should be offered with *bhakti* (*yo me bhaktyā prayacchati*). Otherwise, if one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, “I have so much opulence, and I am giving something to Kṛṣṇa,” one’s offering will not be accepted by Kṛṣṇa. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine class, dealt with Kṛṣṇa with great affection, saying, “Kṛṣṇa, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like.” Thus she filled Kṛṣṇa’s palms with whatever fruits He could carry. In exchange, Kṛṣṇa filled her whole basket with jewels and gold.

From this incident one should learn that for anything offered to Kṛṣṇa with love and affection, Kṛṣṇa can reciprocate many millions of times over, both materially and spiritually. The basic principle involved is an exchange of love. Therefore Kṛṣṇa teaches in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.27):

*yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi  
yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat  
yat tapasyasi kaunteya  
tat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam*

“O son of Kuntī, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.” With love and affection, one should try to give something to Kṛṣṇa from one’s source of income. Then one’s life will be successful. Kṛṣṇa is full in all opulences; He does not need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to Kṛṣṇa, that is for one’s own benefit. The example given in this connection is that when one’s real face is decorated, the reflection of one’s face is automatically decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve Kṛṣṇa with all our opulences, we, as parts and parcels or reflections of Kṛṣṇa, will become happy in exchange. Kṛṣṇa is always happy, for He is *ātmārāma,* fully satisfied with His own opulence.

### Purport

Mother Yaśodā was more attached to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma than Rohiṇīdevī was, although Rohiṇīdevī was the mother of Balarāma. Mother Yaśodā sent Rohiṇīdevī to call Rāma and Kṛṣṇa from Their play, since it was the right time for lunch. Therefore Rohiṇīdevī went to call Them, breaking Their engagement in play.

**Because of being too attached to playing with the other boys, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma did not return upon being called by Rohiṇī. Therefore Rohiṇī sent mother Yaśodā to call Them back, because mother Yaśodā was more affectionate to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.**

### Purport

*Yaśodāṁ preṣayām āsa.* These very words show that since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma did not care to return in response to the order of Rohiṇī, Rohiṇī thought that if Yaśodā called They would have to return, for Yaśodā was more affectionate to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.

### Purport

The word *ajohavīt* means “calling them again and again.” “Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma,” she called, “please come back. You are late for Your lunch. You have played sufficiently. Come back.”

It appears that Nanda Mahārāja regularly took his food with his two sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Yaśodā told the other boys, “Now you should go to your homes.” Father and son generally sit together, so mother Yaśodā requested Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to return, and she advised the other boys to go home so that their parents would not have to wait for them.

**Mother Yaśodā further told Kṛṣṇa: My dear son, because of playing all day, Your body has become covered with dust and sand. Therefore, come back, take Your bath and cleanse Yourself. Today the moon is conjoined with the auspicious star of Your birth. Therefore, be pure and give cows in charity to the brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

It is a custom of Vedic culture that whenever there is any auspicious ceremony, one should give valuable cows in charity to the *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore mother Yaśodā requested Kṛṣṇa, “Instead of being enthusiastic in playing, now please come and be enthusiastic in charity.” *Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat.* As advised in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.5), sacrifice, charity and austerity should never be given up. *Yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām:* even if one is very much advanced in spiritual life, one should not give up these three duties. To observe one’s birthday ceremony, one should do something in terms of one of these three items (*yajña, dāna* or *tapaḥ*), or all of them together.

### Purport

Generally young boys are competitive. If one friend has done something, another friend also wants to do something. Therefore mother Yaśodā pointed out how Kṛṣṇa’s playmates were decorated, so that Kṛṣṇa might be induced to decorate Himself like them.

### Translation

**All these incidents are being caused by some unknown demon. Before he comes here to create another disturbance, it is our duty to go somewhere else with the boys until there are no more disturbances.**

### Purport

Upananda suggested, “By the mercy of Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa has always been saved from so many dangerous incidents. Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Viṣṇu undisturbed, before there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us.” A devotee desires only that he may execute devotional service undisturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of Kṛṣṇa, when Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherd men had the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were disturbances. Of course, in every case, Kṛṣṇa came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about Kṛṣṇa consciousness with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in Kṛṣṇa’s time.

Vṛndāvana is situated between Nandeśvara and Mahāvana. Formerly the cowherd men had shifted to Mahāvana, but still there were disturbances. Therefore the cowherd men selected Vṛndāvana, which was between the two villages, and decided to go there.

As soon as Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were a little grown up, They were meant for taking care of the calves. Although born of a very well-to-do family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of education. Those who were not born in *brāhmaṇa* families were not meant for academic education. The *brāhmaṇas* were trained in a literary, academic education, the *kṣatriyas* were trained to take care of the state, and the *vaiśyas* learned how to cultivate the land and take care of the cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma taught us by Their personal behavior. Kṛṣṇa took care of the cows and played His flute, and Balarāma took care of agricultural activities with a plow in His hand.

Sometimes They would cover Themselves with blankets and imitate cows and bulls and fight with one another, roaring loudly, and sometimes They would imitate the voices of the animals. In this way They enjoyed sporting, exactly like two ordinary human children.**

### Purport

Vṛndāvana is full of peacocks. *Kūjat-kokila-haṁsa-sārasa-gaṇākīrṇe mayūrākule*. The Vṛndāvana forest is always full of cuckoos, ducks, swans, peacocks, cranes and also monkeys, bulls and cows. So Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma used to imitate the sounds of these animals and enjoy sporting.

Kṛṣṇa killed the demon in such a way as to get the *kapittha* fruits to fall so that He and Balarāma and the other boys could take advantage of the opportunity to eat them. The *kapittha* is sometimes called *kṣatbelphala.* The pulp of this fruit is very palatable. It is sweet and sour, and everyone likes it.

### Purport

*Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.* Kṛṣṇa’s daily business here in this material world was to kill the *duṣkṛtīs.* This did not hamper His daily affairs, for it was routine work. While He tended the calves on the bank of the river Yamunā, two or three incidents took place every day, and although these were serious, killing the demons one after another appeared to be His daily routine work.

**Kṛṣṇa, who was the father of Lord Brahmā but who was acting as the son of a cowherd man, became like fire, burning the root of the demon’s throat, and the demon Bakāsura immediately disgorged Him. When the demon saw that Kṛṣṇa, although having been swallowed, was unharmed, he immediately attacked Kṛṣṇa again with his sharp beak.**

### Purport

Although Kṛṣṇa is always as soft as a lotus, within the throat of Bakāsura He created a burning sensation of being hotter than fire. Although Kṛṣṇa’s whole body is sweeter than sugar candy, Bakāsura tasted bitterness and therefore immediately vomited Kṛṣṇa up. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.11), *ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham.* When Kṛṣṇa is accepted as an enemy, He becomes the most intolerable object for the nondevotee, who cannot tolerate Kṛṣṇa within or without. Here this is shown by the example of Bakāsura.

### Purport

Nanda Mahārāja innocently thought, “Perhaps this boy Kṛṣṇa formerly killed all these demons, and therefore in this life they are envious and are attacking Him. But Kṛṣṇa is a fire, and they are flies, and in a fight between fire and flies, the fire is always victorious.” Fighting is always taking place between the demons and the power of the Supreme Personality. *Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām* (Bg. 4.8). Anyone who is against the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be killed, life after life. Ordinary living beings are subject to *karma,* but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always victorious over the demons.

*aho brahma-vidāṁ vāco  
nāsatyāḥ santi karhicit  
gargo yad āha bhagavān  
anvabhāvi tathaiva tat*

### Synonyms

*aho* — how wonderful it is; *brahma*-*vidām* — of persons who have full knowledge of Brahman, transcendence; *vācaḥ* — the words; *na* — never; *asatyāḥ* — untruth; *santi* — become; *karhicit* — at any time; *gargaḥ* — Garga Muni; *yat* — whatever; *āha* — predicted; *bhagavān* — Garga Muni, the most powerful; *anvabhāvi* — is exactly happening; *tathā* *eva* — as; *tat* — that.

### Translation

**The words of persons in full knowledge of Brahman never become untrue. It is very wonderful that whatever Garga Muni predicted we are now actually experiencing in all detail.**

### Purport

The purpose of human life is indicated in the *Brahma-sūtra:* *athāto brahma jijñāsā.* To make one’s life perfect — in the past, present and future — one must learn about Brahman. Because of intense affection, Nanda Mahārāja could not understand Kṛṣṇa as He is. Garga Muni was able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the *Vedas,* but Nanda Mahārāja could not understand Kṛṣṇa directly. Because of his intense love for Kṛṣṇa, he forgot who Kṛṣṇa was and could not understand Kṛṣṇa’s potency. Although Kṛṣṇa is Nārāyaṇa Himself, Garga Muni did not disclose this. Thus Nanda Mahārāja appreciated the words of Garga Muni, but because of his deep affection he could not understand who Kṛṣṇa was, although Garga Muni had said that Kṛṣṇa’s qualities would be exactly like those of Nārāyaṇa.

इति नन्दादयो गोपा- कृष्णरामकथां मुदा ।  
कुर्वन्तो रममाणाश्च नाविन्दन् भववेदनाम् ॥ ५८ ॥

### Verse text

*iti nandādayo gopāḥ  
kṛṣṇa-rāma-kathāṁ mudā  
kurvanto ramamāṇāś ca  
nāvindan bhava-vedanām*

### Synonyms

*iti* — in this way; *nanda*-*ādayaḥ* — all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Mahārāja; *gopāḥ* — cowherd men; *kṛṣṇa*-*rāma*-*kathām* — narration of incidents in connection with Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa and Rāma; *mudā* — in great transcendental pleasure; *kurvantaḥ* — doing that; *ramamāṇāḥ* *ca* — enjoyed life and increased their affection for Kṛṣṇa; *na* — not; *avindan* — perceived; *bhava*-*vedanām* — the tribulations of material existence.

### Translation

**In this way all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Mahārāja, enjoyed topics about the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma with great transcendental pleasure, and they could not even perceive material tribulations.**

### Purport

Here is an instruction about the result of studying or discussing the *kṛṣṇa-līlās* that appear in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* *Sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate ’tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt* (*Bhāg.* 1.1.2). Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā in Vṛndāvana appeared like ordinary persons of this material world, but they never felt the tribulations of this world, although they sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is a practical example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Mahārāja and the *gopas,* we can all be happy simply by discussing the activities of Kṛṣṇa.

*anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād  
bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje  
lokasyājānato vidvāṁś  
cakre sātvata-saṁhitām*

(*Bhāg.* 1.7.6)

Vyāsadeva has given this literature so that everyone may understand one’s transcendental position simply by discussing *bhāgavata-kathā.* Even at the present moment, everyone everywhere can be happy and free from material tribulations by following *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* There is no need of austerities and penances, which in this age are very difficult to perform. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore declared, *sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.* By our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are trying to distribute *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* so that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by chanting and hearing about the activities of Kṛṣṇa and be free from all material tribulations.
