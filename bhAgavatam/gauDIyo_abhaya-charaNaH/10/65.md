CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE

This chapter relates how Lord Balarāma went to Gokula, enjoyed the company of the cowherd girls and dragged the Yamunā River.

One day Lord Balarāma went to Gokula to see His relatives and friends. When He arrived there, the elder *gopīs* and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s parents, Nanda and Yaśodā, who had all been in great anxiety for a long time, embraced Him and blessed Him. Lord Balarāma offered appropriate respects and greetings to each of His worshipable elders according to age, friendship and family relation. After Gokula’s residents and Lord Balarāma had inquired about each other’s welfare, the Lord rested from His journey.

In a short while the young *gopīs* came to Lord Balarāma and questioned Him about Kṛṣṇa’s well-being. They asked, “Does Kṛṣṇa still remember His parents and friends, and will He be coming to Gokula to visit them? For Kṛṣṇa’s sake we gave up everything — even our fathers, mothers and other relatives — but now He has abandoned us. How could we help but put our faith in Kṛṣṇa’s words after seeing His sweetly smiling face and thus being overwhelmed by the urges of Cupid? Still, if Kṛṣṇa can spend His days in separation from us, why can’t we tolerate separation from Him? So there is no reason to keep talking about Him.” In this manner the *gopīs* remembered Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s charming talks, enchanting glances, playful gestures and loving embraces, and as a result they began to cry. Lord Balarāma consoled them by conveying the attractive messages Kṛṣṇa had given Him for them.

Lord Balarāma stayed in Gokula for two months, sporting with the *gopīs* in the groves on the Yamunā’s shore. The demigods who witnessed these pastimes played kettledrums in the heavens and showered down flower petals, while the celestial sages recited Balarāma’s glories.

One day Lord Balarāma became intoxicated by drinking some *vāruṇī* liquor and began wandering about the forest in the company of the *gopīs.* He called out to the Yamunā, “Come near so I and the *gopīs* can enjoy sporting in your waters.” But the Yamunā ignored His command. Lord Balarāma then started to pull the Yamunā with the end of His plow, splitting her into hundreds of tributaries. Trembling out of fright, the goddess Yamunā appeared, fell down at Lord Balarāma’s feet and prayed for forgiveness. The Lord let her go and then entered her waters with His girlfriends to sport for some time. When they rose from the water, the goddess Kānti presented Lord Balarāma with beautiful ornaments, clothing and garlands. Even today the Yamunā River flows through the many channels cut by Lord Baladeva’s plow, the signs of His having subdued her.

While Lord Balarāma played, His mind became enchanted by the *gopīs’* pastimes. Thus the many nights He spent in their company seemed to Him like a single night.

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*balabhadraḥ kuru-śreṣṭha  
bhagavān ratham āsthitaḥ  
suhṛd-didṛkṣur utkaṇṭhaḥ  
prayayau nanda-gokulam*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *balabhadraḥ* — Lord Balarāma; *kuru*-*śreṣṭha* — O best of the Kurus (King Parīkṣit); *bhagavān* — the Supreme Lord; *ratham* — on His chariot; *āsthitaḥ* — mounted; *suhṛt* — His well-wishing friends; *didṛkṣuḥ* — wishing to see; *utkaṇṭhaḥ* — eager; *prayayau* — traveled; *nanda*-*gokulam* — to the cowherd village of Nanda Mahārāja.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O best of the Kurus, once Lord Balarāma, eager to visit His well-wishing friends, mounted His chariot and traveled to Nanda Gokula.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out, Lord Balarāma’s journey to Śrī Vṛndāvana is also described in the *Hari-vaṁśa* (*Viṣṇu-parva* 46.10):

*kasyacid atha kālasya  
smṛtvā gopeṣu sauhṛdam  
jagāmaiko vrajaṁ rāmaḥ  
kṛṣṇasyānumate sthitaḥ*

“Remembering the deep friendship He once enjoyed with the cowherd folk, Lord Rāma went alone to Vraja, having taken Lord Kṛṣṇa’s permission.” The simple residents of Vṛndāvana were aggrieved that Lord Kṛṣṇa had gone to live elsewhere, so Lord Balarāma went there to console them.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura addresses the question of why Lord Kṛṣṇa, the great ocean of pure love, did not also go to Vraja. In explanation the *ācārya* provides the following two verses:

*preyasīḥ prema-vikhyātāḥ  
pitarāv ati-vatsalau  
prema-vaśyaś ca kṛṣṇas tāṁs  
tyaktvā naḥ katham eṣyati*

*iti matvaiva yādavaḥ  
pratyabadhnan harer gatau  
vraja-prema-pravardhi sva-  
līlādhīnatvam īyuṣaḥ*

“The Yadus thought, ‘The Lord’s beloved girlfriends are famous for their pure, ecstatic love, and His parents are extremely affectionate toward Him. Lord Kṛṣṇa is controlled by pure love, so if He goes to see them, how will He be able to leave them and come back to us?’ With this in mind, the Yadus prevented Lord Hari from going, knowing that He becomes subservient to the pastimes in which He reciprocates the ever-increasing love of the inhabitants of Vraja.”

*nityānanda-svarūpo ’pi  
prema-tapto vrajaukasām  
yayau kṛṣṇam api tyaktvā  
yas taṁ rāmaṁ muhuḥ stumaḥ*

“Let us repeatedly glorify Lord Balarāma. Although He is the original personality of eternal bliss, Nityānanda, He felt pained by His love for the residents of Vraja, and thus He went to see them, even at the cost of leaving Lord Kṛṣṇa.”

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī comments on this verse as follows: “Nanda and Yaśodā prayed to Śrī Balarāma, ‘May You, along with Your younger brother, protect us.’ Thus they expressed their respect for the fact that He is the elder brother, and they also showed how much they considered Him their own son.”

Then, after resting, the Lord accepted a comfortable seat, and they all gathered around Him. With voices faltering out of love for Him, those cowherds, who had dedicated everything to lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa, asked about the health of their dear ones \[in Dvārakā\], and Balarāma in turn asked about the cowherds’ welfare.**

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Honored to have the personal audience of Lord Balarāma, the young gopīs smiled and asked Him, “Is Kṛṣṇa, the darling of the city women, living happily?**

### Purport

According to the *ācāryas,* Lord Kṛṣṇa’s beloved girlfriends were smiling with divine madness, since they were feeling extreme unhappiness in separation from their beloved Kṛṣṇa. Lord Rāma deeply respected their great love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, His younger brother, and thus the term *rāma-sandarśanādṛtāḥ* carries the meaning that Balarāma honored the *gopīs,* as well as the given meaning, that they honored Him.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that the *gopīs* would render service to Lord Kṛṣṇa by stringing flower garlands, skillfully using perfumes, and constructing fans, beds and canopies out of flower petals. By these simple acts of love, the *gopīs* rendered the greatest service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**“Why bother talking about Him, dear gopī? Please talk of something else. If He passes His time without us, then we shall similarly pass ours \[without Him\].”**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that the *gopīs* here subtly indicate that Lord Kṛṣṇa spends His time happily without them whereas they are most unhappy without their Lord. This is the difference between Him and them. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds the following commentary: “Considering themselves different from other women, the *gopīs* thought as follows: ‘If other women are together with their lovers, they live, and if they are separated, they die. But we neither live nor die. This is the fate Providence has written on our foreheads. What remedy can we find?’”

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows: “The *gopīs* thought, ‘The Kṛṣṇa moon, after piercing our hearts with the darts of His nectarean laughter, went away. So how will the city women not die when He does the same to them?’ Overwhelmed with these thoughts, the young cowherd girls began to cry, even in the presence of Śrī Baladeva.”

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī quotes the following verse from *Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (5.24.20), which describes the messages Lord Balarāma brought from Kṛṣṇa for the *gopīs:*

*sandeśaiḥ sāma-madhuraiḥ  
prema-garbhair agarvitaiḥ  
rāmeṇāśvāsitā gopyaḥ  
kṛṣṇasyāti-manoharaiḥ*

“Lord Balarāma consoled the *gopīs* by giving them Lord Kṛṣṇa’s most charming messages, which expressed sweet conciliation, which were inspired by His pure love for them, and which were without a tinge of pride.” Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī also comments that the use of the name Saṅkarṣaṇa here implies that Balarāma attracted Lord Kṛṣṇa to appear in His mind and in this way showed Śrī Kṛṣṇa to the *gopīs.* Thus Balarāma consoled Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s beloved girlfriends.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that Lord Kṛṣṇa sent various messages. Some instructed the *gopīs* in transcendental knowledge, others were conciliatory, and still others revealed the Lord’s power. Besides its given meaning, the word *hṛdayaṁ-gamaiḥ* also indicates that these messages were confidential.

### Translation

**Lord Balarāma, the Personality of Godhead, resided there for the two months of Madhu and Mādhava, and during the nights He gave His cowherd girlfriends conjugal pleasure.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī states that the *gopīs* who enjoyed conjugal affairs with Śrī Balarāma during His visit to Gokula had not taken part in Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa* dance, being too young at the time. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī confirms this statement by quoting a phrase from the *Bhāgavatam* (10.15.8) — *gopyo ’ntareṇa bhujayoḥ* — which indicates that there are particular *gopīs* who act as Lord Balarāma’s girlfriends. Furthermore, Jīva Gosvāmī states that during the Holī festivities celebrated when Kṛṣṇa killed Śaṅkhacūḍa, the *gopīs* Lord Balarāma enjoyed with were different from the ones Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī agrees with this explanation.

The *Hari-vaṁśa* therefore also refers to her as *sāgarāṅganā.*

*jātarūpa-mayaṁ caikaṁ

divyaṁ śravaṇa-bhūṣaṇam

“O Lord, please accept as divine ornaments for Your ears this single gold earring studded with diamonds and this primeval lotus called Padma. Kindly accept them, for this act of adornment is traditional.”
