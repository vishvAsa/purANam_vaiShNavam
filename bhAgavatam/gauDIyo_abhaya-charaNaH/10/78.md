CHAPTER SEVENTY-EIGHT

This chapter relates how Lord Kṛṣṇa killed Dantavakra and Vidūratha, visited Vṛndāvana, and then returned to Dvārakā. It also describes how Lord Baladeva killed the offensive Romaharṣaṇa Sūta.

Intent upon avenging the death of his friend Śālva, Dantavakra appeared on the battlefield with club in hand. Lord Kṛṣṇa took up His own club and came before him. Dantavakra then insulted the Lord with harsh words and struck Him a terrific blow on the head. Without budging in the slightest, Lord Kṛṣṇa bludgeoned Dantavakra’s chest, shattering his heart. Dantavakra had a brother named Vidūratha, and he became distraught at Dantavakra’s death. Taking up his sword, Vidūratha confronted Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but the Lord cut off Vidūratha’s head with His Sudarśana disc. Lord Kṛṣṇa then visited Vṛndāvana for two months, and finally He returned to Dvārakā.

When Lord Baladeva heard that the Pāṇḍavas and Kauravas were about to go to war, in order to remain neutral He left Dvārakā on the pretext of going on pilgrimage. The Lord bathed in sacred places such as Prabhāsa, Tritakūpa and Viśāla, and eventually He came to the holy Naimiṣāraṇya forest, where great sages were performing an extended fire sacrifice. While being worshiped by the assembled sages and offered a seat of honor, the Lord noticed that Romaharṣaṇa Sūta, sitting on the speaker’s seat, had failed to stand in deference to Him. Greatly angered by this offense, Lord Balarāma killed Romaharṣaṇa by touching him with the tip of a blade of *kuśa* grass.

The assembled sages were disturbed by what Lord Baladeva had done, and they said to Him, “You have unknowingly killed a *brāhmaṇa.* Therefore, even though You are above the Vedic injunctions, we request You to set a perfect example for the general populace by atoning for this sin.” Then Śrī Baladeva, following the Vedic maxim that “one’s son takes birth as one’s own self,” granted to Romaharṣaṇa’s son Ugraśravā the position of speaker of the *Purāṇas,* and in accordance with the sages’ desires He promised Ugraśravā a long life with unfailing sensory capacity.

Wanting to do something more for the sages, Lord Baladeva promised to kill a demon named Balvala, who had been polluting their sacrificial arena. Finally, on the sages’ advice, He agreed to go on a year-long pilgrimage of all the holy places in India.

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that after having waited for three lifetimes, Dantavakra, formerly a gatekeeper in Vaikuṇṭha, could now return to the spiritual world. Therefore the transcendental meaning of his statement is: “How fortunate! How fortunate I am that today I can return to my constitutional position in the spiritual world!”

In the next verse, Dantavakra will refer to Kṛṣṇa as *mātuleya,* a maternal cousin. Dantavakra’s mother, Śrutaśravā, was the sister of Kṛṣṇa’s father, Vasudeva.

The *ācāryas* have given the following alternate grammatical division of the third line of this verse: *atas tvāṁ gadayā amanda,* in which case Dantavakra says, “My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, You are *amanda* \[not foolish\], and therefore with Your powerful club You will now send me back home, back to Godhead.” This is the inner meaning of this verse.

Further, the word *bandhu-rūpam* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is actually everyone’s true friend, and *vyādhim* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supersoul, the object of meditation within the heart, who takes away our mental distress. Furthermore, the *ācāryas* translate the word *hatvā* as *jñātvā;* in other words, by knowing Kṛṣṇa properly one can actually liberate all of one’s friends.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following elaborate commentary on this section of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:*

Concerning the killing of Dantavakra, the *Uttara-khaṇḍa* (279) of the *Padma Purāṇa* contains further details in the following prose passage: *atha śiśupālaṁ nihataṁ śrutvā dantavakraḥ kṛṣṇena saha yoddhuṁ mathurām ājagāma.* *kṛṣṇas tu tac chrutvā ratham āruhya mathurām āyayau.* “Then, hearing that Śiśupāla had been killed, Dantavakra went to Mathurā to fight against Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa, moreover, heard of this, He mounted His chariot and went to Mathurā.”

*Tayor dantavakra-vāsudevayor aho-rātraṁ mathurā-dvāri saṅgrāmaḥ samavartata;* *kṛṣṇas tu gadayā taṁ jaghāna;* *sa tu cūrṇita-sarvāṅgo vajra-nirbhinno mahīdhara iva gatāsur avani-tale nipapāta; so ’pi hareḥ sārūpyeṇa yogi-gamyaṁ nityānanda-sukha-daṁ śāśvataṁ paramaṁ padam avāpa:* “Between the two of them — Dantavakra and Lord Vāsudeva — there then began a battle at the gate of Mathurā that lasted all day and night. Finally Kṛṣṇa struck Dantavakra with His club, at which point Dantavakra fell lifeless to the ground, all his limbs smashed like a mountain shattered by a lightning bolt. Dantavakra achieved the liberation of gaining a form equal to the Lord’s, and thus he also achieved the Lord’s eternal, supreme abode, attainable by perfect *yogīs,* which bestows the happiness of everlasting spiritual bliss.”

*Itthaṁ jaya-vijayau sanakādi-śāpa-vyājena kevalaṁ bhagavato līlārthaṁ saṁsṛtāv avatīrya janma-traye ’pi tenaiva nihatau janma-trayāvasāne muktim avāptau:* “So it was that Jaya and Vijaya — apparently because of being cursed by Sanaka and his brothers but actually to facilitate the Supreme Lord’s pastimes — descended to this material world and in three consecutive lifetimes were killed by the Lord Himself. Then, at the completion of these three lifetimes, they attained liberation.”

In this passage of the *Padma Purāṇa* the words *kṛṣṇas tu tac chrutvā,* “when Kṛṣṇa heard of this,” indicate that the Lord heard from Nārada, who travels as swiftly as the mind, that Dantavakra had gone to Mathurā. Therefore immediately after killing Śālva, without first entering Dvārakā, the Lord reached the vicinity of Mathurā in a single moment on His chariot, which also moves as swiftly as the mind, and there He saw Dantavakra. Thus it is that even today, by the gate of Mathurā facing the direction of Dvārakā, there is a village known in the vernacular as Datihā, a name derived from the Sanskrit *dantavakra-ha,* “killer of Dantavakra.” This village was founded by Kṛṣṇa’s great-grandson Vajra.

In the same section of the *Padma Purāṇa*, these statements follow: *kṛṣṇo ’pi taṁ hatvā yamunām uttīrya nanda-vrajaṁ gatvā sotkaṇṭhau pitarāv abhivādyāśvāsya tābhyāṁ sāśru-sekam āliṅgitaḥ sakala-gopa-vṛddhān praṇamya bahu-vastrābharaṇādibhis tatra-sthān santarpayām āsa.* “And after killing him \[Vidūratha\], Kṛṣṇa crossed the Yamunā and went to the cowherd village of Nanda, where He honored and consoled His aggrieved parents. They drenched Him with tears and embraced Him, and then the Lord offered obeisances to the elder cowherd men and gratified all the residents with abundant gifts of clothing, ornaments and so on.”

*kālindyāḥ puline ramye  
puṇya-vṛkṣa-samācite  
gopa-nārībhir aniśaṁ  
krīḍayām āsa keśavaḥ*

*ramya-keli-sukhenaiva  
gopa-veśa-dharaḥ prabhuḥ  
bahu-prema-rasenātra  
māsa-dvayam uvāsa ha*

“Lord Keśava sported continuously with the cowherd women on the Kālindī’s charming bank, which was filled with pious trees. Thus the Supreme Lord, assuming the appearance of a cowherd, resided there for two months, enjoying the pleasure of intimate pastimes in various moods of loving reciprocation.”

*Atha tatra-sthā nanda-gopādayaḥ sarve janāḥ putra-dārādi-sahitā vāsudeva-prasādena divya-rūpa-dharā vimānam ārūḍhāḥ paramaṁ vaikuṇṭha-lokam avāpuḥ;* *kṛṣṇas tu nanda-gopa-vrajaukasāṁ sarveṣāṁ nirāmayaṁ sva-padaṁ dattvā divi deva-gaṇaiḥ saṁstūyamāno dvāravatīṁ viveśa:* “Then, by Lord Vāsudeva’s grace, Nanda and all the other residents of that place, together with their children and wives, assumed their eternal, spiritual forms, boarded a celestial airplane and ascended to the supreme Vaikuṇṭha planet \[Goloka Vṛndāvana\]. Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, after bestowing on Nanda Gopa and all the other inhabitants of Vraja His own transcendental abode, which is free of all disease, traveled through the sky and returned to Dvārakā as demigods chanted His praises.”

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī comments as follows on this passage in his *Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta* (1.488-89):

*vrajeśāder aṁśa-bhūtā  
ye droṇādyā avātaran  
kṛṣṇas tān eva vaikuṇṭhe  
prāhiṇod iti sāmpratam*

*preṣṭhebhyo ’pi priyatamair  
janair gokula-vāsibhiḥ  
vṛndāraṇye sadaivāsau  
vihāraṁ kurute hariḥ*

“Since Droṇa and other demigods had previously descended to earth to merge as partial expansions into the King of Vraja and other devotees of Vṛndāvana, at this time it was these demigod expansions whom Lord Kṛṣṇa sent off to Vaikuṇṭha. Lord Hari is perpetually enjoying pastimes in Vṛndāvana with His intimate devotees, the residents of Gokula, who are dearer to Him than even His most dear other devotees.”

In the passage of the *Padma Purāṇa,* the word *putra* in the phrase *nanda-gopādayaḥ sarve janāḥ putra-dārādi-sahitāḥ* (“Nanda Gopa and the others, together with their children and wives”) refers to such sons as Kṛṣṇa, Śrīdāmā and Subala, while the word *dāra* refers to such wives as Śrī Yaśodā and Kīrtidā, the mother of Rādhārāṇī. The phrase *sarve janāḥ* (“all the people”) refers to everyone living in the district of Vraja. Thus they all went to the topmost Vaikuṇṭha planet, Goloka. The phrase *divya-rūpa-dharāḥ* indicates that in Goloka they engage in pastimes appropriate to demigods, not those suited to humans, as in Gokula. Just as during Lord Rāmacandra’s incarnation the residents of Ayodhyā were transported to Vaikuṇṭha in their selfsame bodies, so in this incarnation of Kṛṣṇa the residents of Vraja attained to Goloka in theirs.

Lord Kṛṣṇa’s journey from Dvārakā to Vraja is confirmed by the following passage of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.11.9): *yarhy ambujākṣāpasasāra bho bhavān kurūn madhūn vātha suhṛd-didṛkṣayā/ tatrābda-koṭi-pratimaḥ kṣaṇo bhavet.* “O lotus-eyed Lord, whenever You go away to Mathurā, Vṛndāvana or Hastināpura to meet Your friends and relatives, every moment of Your absence seems like a million years.” Lord Kṛṣṇa had been harboring a desire to go see His friends and relatives in Vraja ever since Lord Baladeva had gone there, but His mother, father and other elders in Dvārakā had refused to give Him permission. Now, however, after the killing of Śālva, when Kṛṣṇa heard from Nārada that Dantavakra had gone to Mathurā, no one could object to the Lord’s going there immediately without first entering Dvārakā. And after killing Dantavakra, He would have the opportunity to meet with His friends and relatives living in Vraja.

Thinking like this, and also remembering Uddhava’s allusion to the *gopīs* in the words *gāyanti te viśada-karma* (*Bhāg.* 10.71.9), He went to Vraja, dispelling the feelings of separation of the inhabitants. For two months Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed in Vṛndāvana just as before, previous to His leaving there to kill Kaṁsa in Mathurā. Then, at the end of two months, He withdrew His Vraja pastimes from mundane eyes by taking the demigod portions of His parents and other relatives and friends to Vaikuṇṭha. Thus, in one complete plenary manifestation He went to Goloka in the spiritual world, in another He remained perpetually enjoying in Vraja while invisible to material eyes, and in yet another He mounted His chariot and returned alone to Dvārakā. The people of Śaurasena province thought that after killing Dantavakra Kṛṣṇa had paid a visit to His parents and other dear ones and now was returning to Dvārakā. The people of Vraja, on the other hand, could not understand where He had suddenly disappeared to, and so they were totally astonished.

Furthermore, Śukadeva considered that Parīkṣit Mahārāja might think, “How is it that the same Kṛṣṇa who caused the cowherds to attain Vaikuṇṭha in their selfsame bodies also caused the residents of Dvārakā to attain such an inauspicious condition in the course of His *mauṣala-līlā*?” Thus the King might consider the arrangement unfair because of his own affinity for the Yadus. That is why Śukadeva Gosvāmī did not allow him to hear this pastime, which, as mentioned above, is related in the *Uttara-khaṇḍa* of *Śrī Padma Purāṇa.*

In *Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī,* Sanātana Gosvāmī’s commentary on the Tenth Canto, we find the following sequential list of pastimes: First was the journey on the occasion of the solar eclipse, then the Rājasūya assembly, then the gambling match and attempted disrobing of Draupadī, then the Pāṇḍavas’ exile to the forest, then the killing of Śālva and Dantavakra, then Kṛṣṇa’s visit to Vṛndāvana, and finally the winding up of the Vṛndāvana pastimes.

Both Duryodhana and Yudhiṣṭhira were dear to Lord Balarāma, and so to avoid an awkward situation He departed. Furthermore, after killing the demon Vidūratha, Lord Kṛṣṇa put aside His weapons, but Lord Balarāma still had to kill Romaharṣaṇa and Balvala to finish relieving the earth of her burden of demons.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Although Lord Balarāma had stopped killing the impious, Romaharṣaṇa’s death was inevitable. Thus, having spoken, the Lord killed him by picking up a blade of kuśa grass and touching him with its tip.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “Lord Balarāma had avoided taking part in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, and yet because of His position as an incarnation, the reestablishment of religious principles was His prime duty. Considering these points, He killed Romaharṣaṇa Sūta simply by striking him with a *kuśa* straw, which was nothing but a blade of grass. If someone questions how Lord Balarāma could kill Romaharṣaṇa Sūta simply by striking him with a blade of *kuśa* grass, the answer is given in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* by the use of the word *prabhu,* ‘master.’ The Lord’s position is always transcendental, and because He is omnipotent He can act as He likes without being obliged to follow the material laws and principles. Thus it was possible for Him to kill Romaharṣaṇa Sūta simply by striking him with a blade of *kuśa* grass.”

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out that the word *viśudhyasi* means that Lord Balarāma would achieve spotless fame by setting such a perfect example for the people in general.

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “The *brāhmaṇas* could understand the purpose of the Lord, and thus they suggested that He atone in a manner which would be beneficial to them.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Seventy-eighth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Killing of Dantavakra, Vidūratha and Romaharṣaṇa.”*
