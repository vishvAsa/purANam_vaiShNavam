CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE

This chapter describes Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa* dance, which He enjoyed with His beloved girlfriends in the forests along the Yamunā River.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is most expert in the knowledge of transcendental moods. In the company of the *gopīs,* who were tightly bound to Him by the ropes of affection and totally dedicated to His service, the Lord expanded Himself into numerous forms. The *gopīs* became intoxicated with their enthusiasm to enjoy the *rāsa* dance, and thus they began satisfying Kṛṣṇa’s senses by singing, dancing and gesturing amorously. The sweet voices of the *gopīs* filled all the directions.

Even after Lord Kṛṣṇa manifested Himself in numerous forms, each *gopī* thought He was standing next to her alone. Gradually the *gopīs* became fatigued from the continuous dancing and singing, and each of them placed her arm on the shoulder of the Kṛṣṇa standing beside her. Some *gopīs* smelled and kissed Kṛṣṇa’s arm, which bore the fragrance of the lotus and was anointed with sandalwood paste. Others put Kṛṣṇa’s hand on their bodies, and yet others gave Kṛṣṇa pleasure by embracing Him lovingly.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, being the Supreme Absolute Truth, is the only actual enjoyer and object of enjoyment. Although He is one without a second, He expands Himself into many forms to increase His personal pastimes. Therefore great scholars say that Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa-līlā* is like a child’s playing with His own reflection. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is self-satisfied and fully endowed with inconceivable, transcendental opulences. When He exhibits such pastimes as the *rāsa-līlā,* all living beings, from Brahmā down to the blades of grass, become merged in the ocean of astonishment.

When Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard the narration of Kṛṣṇa’s conjugal pastimes with the *gopīs,* which superficially resemble the activities of lusty, wanton persons, he expressed a doubt to the great devotee Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Śukadeva dispelled this doubt by stating, “Since Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the absolute enjoyer, such pastimes as these can never be contaminated by any fault. But if anyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead tries to enjoy such pastimes, he will suffer the same fate that someone other than Lord Rudra would suffer if he attempted to drink an ocean of poison. Moreover, even one who only thinks of imitating Lord Kṛṣṇa’s *rāsa-līlā* will certainly suffer misfortune.”

The Supreme Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is present within the hearts of all living entities as their indwelling witness. When out of His mercy He exhibits His intimate pastimes to His devotees, these activities are never besmirched by mundane imperfection. Any living being who hears of the spontaneous loving attraction the *gopīs* felt for Lord Kṛṣṇa will have his desires for material sense gratification destroyed at the root and will develop his natural propensity for serving the Supreme Lord, the spiritual master, and the Lord’s devotees.

### Translation

**The festive rāsa dance commenced, with the gopīs arrayed in a circle. Lord Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself and entered between each pair of gopīs, and as that master of mystic power placed His arms around their necks, each girl thought He was standing next to her alone. The demigods and their wives were overwhelmed with eagerness to witness the rāsa dance, and they soon crowded the sky with their hundreds of celestial airplanes.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura has written the following verse about the *rāsa* dance:

*aṅganām aṅganām antarā mādhavo  
mādhavaṁ mādhavaṁ cāntareṇāṅganāḥ  
ittham ākalpite maṇḍale madhya-gaḥ  
sañjagau veṇunā devakī-nandanaḥ*

“Lord Mādhava was situated between each pair of *gopīs,* and a *gopī* was situated between each pair of His manifestations. And Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Devakī, also appeared in the middle of the circle, playing upon His flute and singing.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that the *gopīs,* maddened by love, were unable to understand that Śrī Kṛṣṇa had expanded Himself so He could personally dance with each of them. Each *gopī* saw one manifestation of Kṛṣṇa. The demigods and their wives, however, could see all His different manifestations as they watched the *rāsa* dance from their airplanes, and thus they were completely astonished.

### Purport

As stated here, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glory in dancing the *rāsa* dance is pure spiritual bliss. The demigods in heaven, in charge of maintaining propriety in the universe, ecstatically accepted the *rāsa* dance as the ultimate religious affair, completely different from the perverted reflection of romance we find in this mundane world.

### Synonyms

*pāda* — of their feet; *nyāsaiḥ* — by the placement; *bhuja* — of their hands; *vidhutibhiḥ* — by the gestures; *sa*-*smitaiḥ* — smiling; *bhrū* — of their eyebrows; *vilāsaiḥ* — by the playful movements; *bhajyan* — bending; *madhyaiḥ* — by their middles; *cala* — moving; *kuca* — covering their breasts; *paṭaiḥ* — by the cloths; *kuṇḍalaiḥ* — by their earrings; *gaṇḍa* — on their cheeks; *lolaiḥ* — rolling; *svidyan* — perspiring; *mukhyaḥ* — whose faces; *kavara* — the braids of their hair; *rasanā* — and their belts; *āgranthayaḥ* — having tightly tied; *kṛṣṇa*-*vadhvaḥ* — the consorts of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *gāyantyaḥ* — singing; *tam* — about Him; *taḍitaḥ* — bolts of lightning; *iva* — as if; *tāḥ* — they; *megha*-*cakre* — in a range of clouds; *virejuḥ* — shone.

### Translation

**As the gopīs sang in praise of Kṛṣṇa, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that according to the analogy of lightning flashing in clouds, the perspiration on the lovely faces of the *gopīs* resembled drops of mist, and their singing resembled thunder. The word *āgranthayaḥ* may also be read *agranthayaḥ,* meaning “loosened.” This would indicate that although the *gopīs* began the dance with their hair and belts tightly drawn, these gradually slackened and loosened.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the *gopīs* were expert at exhibiting *mudrās* (precise hand gestures that express feelings or convey meanings associated with the theme of a performance). Thus sometimes Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs* would artistically move their interlocked arms together, and sometimes they would separate arms and exhibit *mudrās* to act out the meaning of the songs they were singing.

The word *pāda-nyāsaiḥ* indicates that the *gopīs* artistically and gracefully placed the steps of their dancing feet in an enchanting way, and the words *sa-smitair bhrū-vilāsair* indicate that the romantic movements of their eyebrows, smiling with love, were most charming to behold.

According to an authoritative book on music called *Saṅgīta-sāra,* *tāvanta eva rāgāḥ sūryāvatyo jīva-jātayaḥ,* *teṣu ṣoḍaśa-sāhasrī purā gopī-kṛtā varā:* “There are as many musical *rāgas* as there are species of life. Among these *rāgas* are sixteen thousand principal ones, which were manifested by the *gopīs.*” Thus the *gopīs* created sixteen thousand different *rāgas,* or musical modes, and these have subsequently been disseminated throughout the world. The words *yad-gītenedam āvṛtam* also indicate that even today devotees throughout the world sing the praises of Kṛṣṇa, following the example of the *gopīs.*

### Translation

**When one gopī grew tired from the rāsa dance, She turned to Kṛṣṇa, standing at Her side holding a baton, and grasped His shoulder with Her arm. The dancing had loosened Her bracelets and the flowers in Her hair.**

### Purport

The previous verse states that Śrī Kṛṣṇa honored the *gopīs* for their dancing and singing, and in this verse we see how the *gopīs* responded by dealing intimately and confidently with Him. Here a tired *gopī* held on to Kṛṣṇa’s shoulder with her arm, resting against Him.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that the word *gadā* in this verse indicates a baton suitable for a dancing master. Lord Kṛṣṇa brought this item of paraphernalia to enhance His enjoyment of the *rāsa* dance. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that the *gopī* mentioned here is Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, whereas the two *gopīs* mentioned in the previous verse are, in order, Viśākhā and Lalitā.

### Translation

**In this way Lord Kṛṣṇa, the original Lord Nārāyaṇa, master of the goddess of fortune, took pleasure in the company of the young women of Vraja by embracing them, caressing them and glancing lovingly at them as He smiled His broad, playful smiles. It was just as if a child were playing with his own reflection.**

### Purport

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura comments as follows on this verse: “Lord Kṛṣṇa alone is the Supreme Absolute Truth, and His potencies are unlimited. All these potencies, taking personal forms, engage Lord Kṛṣṇa in His pastimes. Just as the opulent manifestation of His one supreme transcendental potency manifests all the countless potencies of the Lord, so in the *rāsa* dance Kṛṣṇa manifests Himself as many times as there are various potencies represented by the *gopīs.* Everything is Kṛṣṇa, but by His desire His spiritual energy Yoga-māyā manifests the *gopīs.* When His internal potency Yoga-māyā thus produces such pastimes for the enhancement of His transcendental emotions, it is just like a young boy playing with His own reflection. But since these pastimes are created by His spiritual potency, they are eternal and self-manifesting.”

### Purport

It is difficult to translate into English the word *rasa,* which indicates the spiritual bliss derived from one’s loving relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa. That bliss is experienced in the midst of spiritual pastimes with the Lord and His devotees. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that great Vaiṣṇava poets like Vyāsa, Parāśara, Jayadeva, Līlāśuka (Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura), Govardhanācārya and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī have tried in their poetry to describe the conjugal affairs of the Lord. These descriptions are never complete, however, since the Lord’s pastimes are unlimited; thus the attempt to glorify such pastimes is still going on and will go on forever. Lord Kṛṣṇa arranged an extraordinary season of beautiful autumn nights to enhance His loving affairs, and those autumn nights have inspired transcendental poets since time immemorial.

Great, potent personalities are not ruined by an apparent transgression of moral principles. Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions the examples of Brahmā, Indra, Soma, Viśvāmitra and others. A fire devours all that is fed into it but the fire does not change its nature. Similarly, a great personality does not fall from his position by an irregularity in behavior. In the following verse, however, Śukadeva Gosvāmī makes it clear that if we try to imitate the great personalities ruling the universe, the result will be catastrophic.

### Translation

**One who is not a great controller should never imitate the behavior of ruling personalities, even mentally. If out of foolishness an ordinary person does imitate such behavior, he will simply destroy himself, just as a person who is not Rudra would destroy himself if he tried to drink an ocean of poison.**

### Purport

Lord Śiva, or Rudra, once drank an ocean of poison, and the result was that an attractive blue mark appeared on his neck. But if we were to drink even a drop of such poison, we would die immediately. Just as we should not imitate this pastime of Śiva’s, we should not imitate Lord Kṛṣṇa’s activities with the *gopīs.* We should clearly understand that while Lord Kṛṣṇa certainly descends to demonstrate religious principles, He also descends to demonstrate that He is God and we are not. That also must be demonstrated. The Lord enjoys with His internal potency and thus attracts us to the spiritual platform. We should not try to imitate Kṛṣṇa, for we will suffer severely.

### Translation

**The statements of the Lord’s empowered servants are always true, and the acts they perform are exemplary when consistent with those statements. Therefore one who is intelligent should carry out their instructions.**

### Purport

The word *īśvara* is usually defined in Sanskrit dictionaries as “lord, master, ruler,” and also as “capable, potent to perform.” Śrīla Prabhupāda often translated the word *īśvara* as “controller,” which brilliantly synthesizes the two fundamental concepts of *īśvara,* namely a master or ruler and a capable or potent person. A master may be incompetent, but a controller is a master or lord who in fact makes things happen. The *parameśvara,* the supreme *īśvara,* the supreme controller, is of course God, Kṛṣṇa, the cause of all causes.

Although people in general, especially in the Western countries, are not aware of the fact, powerful personalities control our universe. The modern, impersonal concept of the universe depicts an almost totally lifeless cosmos in which the earth floats meaninglessly. Thus we are left with the dubious “ultimate purpose” of preserving and reproducing our genetic code, which has its own “ultimate purpose” of adding another link to the meaningless chain of events by again reproducing itself.

In contrast to this sterile, meaningless world concocted by ignorant materialists, the actual universe is full of life — personal life — and in fact full of God, who pervades and supports all that exists. The essence of reality is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His personal relationship with the innumerable living beings, of whom we are samples. Some of the living beings are trapped in the illusion of materialism, or identification with the material body, while others are liberated, aware of their eternal, spiritual nature. A third class comprises those progressing in self-realization from the materialistic state of ignorance to the enlightened state of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Reality is ultimately personal and divine, and therefore it is not surprising that, as the Vedic literature reveals to us, our universe and other universes are managed by great personalities, just as our city, state and country are managed by empowered personalities. When we democratically award a particular politician the right to govern, we vote for him because he has exhibited something we call “leadership” or “ability.” We think, “He’ll get the job done.” In other words, it is only after an individual acquires the power to govern that we vote for him; our vote does not make him a leader but rather recognizes a power in him coming from some other source. Thus, as Lord Kṛṣṇa explains at the end of the Tenth Chapter of the *Bhagavad-gītā,* any living being exhibiting an extraordinary power, ability or authority must have been empowered by the Lord Himself or by the Lord’s energy.

Those directly empowered by the Lord are devoted to Him, and thus their power and influence spread goodness throughout the world, whereas those who are empowered by the Lord’s illusory potency are in an indirect relationship with Kṛṣṇa because they do not directly reflect His will. Of course, they do reflect His will indirectly, since it is by Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement that the laws of nature act upon ignorant living beings, gradually persuading them, through their journey of many lifetimes, to surrender to the Supreme Lord. Thus as politicians create wars, false hopes and innumerable passionate schemes for the materialistic persons who follow them, the politicians are indirectly carrying out the Lord’s program of allowing the conditioned souls to experience the bitter fruit of godlessness.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has translated the word *īśvarāṇām* as “those who have become powerful through knowledge and austerity.” As one understands the nature and will of God and makes the personal sacrifice required to achieve excellence in spiritual life, one becomes empowered by the Supreme Lord to represent His will, which one has intelligently recognized and accepted.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead kindly descends to earth to show a vivid example of religious behavior. As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.24), “If I did not execute standard duties, the whole world would be misled and in fact destroyed.” Thus the Lord showed, in His different incarnations, how to act properly in this world. A good example is Lord Rāmacandra, who behaved wonderfully as the son of King Daśaratha.

But when Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself descends, He also demonstrates the ultimate religious principle, namely that the Supreme Lord is beyond all other living beings and that no one can imitate His supreme position. This foremost of all religious principles — that the Lord is unique, without equal or superior — was clearly demonstrated in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s apparently immoral pastimes with the *gopīs.* No one can imitate these activities without incurring dire consequences, as explained here by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. One who thinks that Lord Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary living being subjected to lust, or who accepts His *rāsa* dance as admirable and tries to imitate it, will certainly be vanquished, as described in text 30 of this chapter.

Finally, a distinction must be made between the Lord and His empowered servants. An empowered servant of the Lord, as in the case of Brahmā, may experience a remnant of reactions to previous activities, according to the law of *karma.* But the Lord is eternally free from any entanglement in the laws of *karma.* He is on a unique platform.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**How, then, could the Lord of all created beings — animals, men and demigods — have any connection with the piety and impiety that affect His subject creatures?**

### Purport

As explained in text 32, even great personalities empowered by the Lord are free from the laws of *karma.* Then what to speak of the Lord Himself. After all, the law of *karma* is created by Him and is an expression of His omnipotent will. Therefore His activities, which He performs out of His own pure goodness, are never subject to criticism by ordinary living beings.

### Synonyms

*yat* — whose; *pāda*-*paṅkaja* — of the lotus feet; *parāga* — of the dust; *niṣeva* — by the service; *tṛptāḥ* — satisfied; *yoga*-*prabhāva* — by the power of *yoga*; *vidhuta* — washed away; *akhila* — all; *karma* — of fruitive activity; *bandhāḥ* — whose bondage; *svairam* — freely; *caranti* — they act; *munayaḥ* — wise sages; *api* — also; *na* — never; *nahyamānāḥ* — becoming bound up; *tasya* — of Him; *icchayā* — by His desire; *ātta* — accepted; *vapuṣaḥ* — transcendental bodies; *kutaḥ* — where; *eva* — indeed; *bandhaḥ* — bondage.

### Translation

**Material activities never entangle the devotees of the Supreme Lord, who are fully satisfied by serving the dust of His lotus feet. Nor do material activities entangle those intelligent sages who have freed themselves from the bondage of all fruitive reactions by the power of yoga. So how could there be any question of bondage for the Lord Himself, who assumes His transcendental forms according to His own sweet will?**

*gopīnāṁ tat-patīnāṁ ca

krīḍaneneha deha-bhāk*

### Synonyms

*gopīnām* — of the *gopīs*; *tat*-*patīnām* — of their husbands; *ca* — and; *sarveṣām* — of all; *eva* — indeed; *dehinām* — embodied living beings; *yaḥ* — who; *antaḥ* — within; *carati* — lives; *saḥ* — He; *adhyakṣaḥ* — the overseeing witness; *krīḍanena* — for sport; *iha* — in this world; *deha* — His form; *bhāk* — assuming.

### Translation

**He who lives as the overseeing witness within the gopīs and their husbands, and indeed within all embodied living beings, assumes forms in this world to enjoy transcendental pastimes.**

### Purport

We certainly do not assume our bodies to enjoy transcendental pastimes, as the Lord does. We eternal souls have accepted material bodies by force because of our foolish attempt to enjoy this material world. The Lord’s forms are all eternal, spiritual existence and cannot be reasonably equated with our temporary flesh.

Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord dwelling within the *gopīs,* their so-called husbands and all other living beings, what possible sin could there be on His part if He embraces some of the beings He Himself has created? What fault could there be if the Lord goes with the *gopīs* to a secret place, since He already dwells within the most secret part of every living being, the core of the heart?

अनुग्रहाय भक्तानां मानुषं देहमास्थित- ।

### Verse text

*anugrahāya bhaktānāṁ  
mānuṣaṁ deham āsthitaḥ  
bhajate tādṛśīḥ krīḍa  
yāḥ śrutvā tat-paro bhavet*

### Synonyms

*anugrahāya* — to show mercy; *bhaktānām* — to His devotees; *mānuṣam* — humanlike; *deham* — a body; *āsthitaḥ* — assuming; *bhajate* — He accepts; *tādṛśīḥ* — such; *kriḍāḥ* — pastimes; *yāḥ* — about which; *śrutvā* — hearing; *tat*-*paraḥ* — dedicated to Him; *bhavet* — one becomes.

### Translation

**When the Lord assumes a humanlike body to show mercy to His devotees, He engages in such pastimes as will attract those who hear about them to become dedicated to Him.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains in this connection that when Lord Kṛṣṇa descends to this world in His original two-handed form, out of kindness He manifests that form in a way His devotees conditioned in human society can perceive and understand. Thus here it is stated, *mānuṣaṁ deham āsthitaḥ:* “He assumes a humanlike body.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura glorifies the Lord’s conjugal pastimes, stating that these romantic affairs have an inconceivable spiritual potency to attract the polluted heart of conditioned souls. It is an undeniable fact that any pure- or simple-hearted person who hears narrations of the loving affairs of Kṛṣṇa will be attracted to the lotus feet of the Lord and gradually become His devotee.

नासूयन् खलु कृष्णाय मोहितास्तस्य मायया ।  
मन्यमाना- स्वपार्श्वस्थान्स्वान्स्वान्दारान् व्रजौकस- ॥ ३७ ॥

### Verse text

*nāsūyan khalu kṛṣṇāya  
mohitās tasya māyayā  
manyamānāḥ sva-pārśva-sthān  
svān svān dārān vrajaukasaḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* *asūyan* — were not jealous; *khalu* — even; *kṛṣṇāya* — against Kṛṣṇa; *mohitāḥ* — bewildered; *tasya* — His; *māyayā* — by the spiritual potency of illusion; *manyamānāḥ* — thinking; *sva*-*pārśva* — at their own sides; *sthān* — standing; *svān* *svān* — each their own; *dārān* — wives; *vraja*-*okasaḥ* — the cowherd men of Vraja.

### Translation

**The cowherd men, bewildered by Kṛṣṇa’s illusory potency, thought their wives had remained home at their sides. Thus they did not harbor any jealous feelings against Him.**

### Purport

Because the *gopīs* loved Kṛṣṇa exclusively, Yoga-māyā protected their relationship with the Lord at all times, even though they were married. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes from the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* as follows:

*māyā-kalpita-tādṛk-strī  
śīlanenānusūyubhiḥ  
na jātu vrajadevīnāṁ  
patibhiḥ saha saṅgamaḥ*

“The *gopīs’* jealous husbands consorted not with their wives but with doubles manufactured by Māyā. Thus these men never actually had any intimate contact with the divine ladies of Vraja.” The *gopīs* are the internal energy of the Lord and can never belong to any other living being. Kṛṣṇa arranged their apparent marriage to other men simply to create the excitement of *parakīya-rasa,* the love between a married woman and her paramour. These activities are absolutely pure because they are the Lord’s pastimes, and saintly persons since time immemorial have relished these supreme spiritual events.

ब्रह्मरात्र उपावृत्ते वासुदेवानुमोदिता- ।  
अनिच्छन्त्यो ययुर्गोप्य- स्वगृहान्भगवत्प्रिया- ॥ ३८ ॥

### Verse text

*brahma-rātra upāvṛtte  
vāsudevānumoditāḥ  
anicchantyo yayur gopyaḥ  
sva-gṛhān bhagavat-priyāḥ*

### Synonyms

*brahma*-*rātre* — the nighttime of Brahmā; *upāvṛtte* — being completed; *vāsudeva* — by Lord Kṛṣṇa; *anumoditāḥ* — advised; *anicchantyaḥ* — unwilling; *yayuḥ* — went; *gopyaḥ* — the *gopīs*; *sva*-*gṛhān* — to their homes; *bhagavat* — of the Supreme Lord; *priyāḥ* — the dear consorts.

### Translation

**After an entire night of Brahmā had passed, Lord Kṛṣṇa advised the gopīs to return to their homes. Although they did not wish to do so, the Lord’s beloved consorts complied with His command.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.17) Lord Kṛṣṇa explains, “By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahmā’s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.” Thus one thousand ages entered within a single twelve-hour night when Lord Kṛṣṇa performed His *rāsa* dance. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī compares this inconceivable impression of time to the fact that many universes fit neatly within the forty-mile range of earthly Vṛndāvana. Or one may consider that mother Yaśodā could not encircle the small abdomen of child Kṛṣṇa with numerous ropes, and that at another time He manifested many universes within His mouth. The transcendence of spiritual reality above and beyond mundane physics is concisely explained in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Laghu-bhagavatāmṛta:*

*evaṁ prabhoḥ priyāṇāṁ ca  
dhāmnaś ca samayasya ca  
avicintya-prabhāvatvād  
atra kiñcin na durghaṭam*

“Nothing is impossible for the Lord, His dear devotees, His transcendental abode or the time of His pastimes, for all these entities are inconceivably powerful.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further explains that the word *vāsudevānumoditāḥ* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa advised the *gopīs,* “To assure the success of these pastimes, you and I should keep them secret.” The word *vāsudeva,* a name of Kṛṣṇa, also indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa’s plenary expansion who acts as the presiding Deity of consciousness. When the word *vāsudeva* is understood in this context, the word *vāsudevānumoditāḥ* indicates that the presiding Deity of consciousness, Vāsudeva, manifested embarrassment and fear of their elders within the *gopīs’* hearts, and therefore it was only with great reluctance that the young girls returned home.

### Synonyms

*vikrīḍitam* — the sporting; *vraja*-*vadhūbhiḥ* — with the young women of Vṛndāvana; *idam* — this; *ca* — and; *viṣṇoḥ* — by Lord Viṣṇu; *śraddhā*-*anvitaḥ* — faithfully; *anuśṛṇuyāt* — hears; *atha* — or; *varṇayet* — describes; *yaḥ* — who; *bhaktim* — devotional service; *parām* — transcendental; *bhagavati* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *pratilabhya* — obtaining; *kāmam* — material lust; *hṛt* — in the heart; *rogam* — the disease; *āśu* — quickly; *apahinoti* — he drives away; *acireṇa* — without delay; *dhīraḥ* — sober.

### Translation

**Anyone who faithfully hears or describes the Lord’s playful affairs with the young gopīs of Vṛndāvana will attain the Lord’s pure devotional service. Thus he will quickly become sober and conquer lust, the disease of the heart.**

### Purport

The extraordinary power of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s conjugal pastimes is clearly revealed here. Qualitatively, the Lord’s spiritual, loving pastimes are the diametric opposite of material, lusty affairs, so much so that simply by hearing about the Lord’s pastimes a devotee conquers sex desire. By reading pornographic literature or hearing about material romance, we certainly do not conquer sex desire but rather increase our lust. But hearing or reading about the Lord’s conjugal affairs has exactly the opposite effect because they are of the opposite nature, being purely spiritual. Therefore it is by the causeless mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa that He exhibits His *rāsa-līlā* within this world. If we become attached to this narration, we will experience the bliss of spiritual love and thus reject the perverted reflection of that love, which is called lust. As nicely put by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.59), *paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:* “Once having directly experienced the Supreme, one will not return to material pleasures.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-third Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Rāsa Dance.”*
