CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE

This chapter relates how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, after freeing the kings imprisoned by Jarāsandha, mercifully gave them His audience and bestowed royal gifts upon them.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa freed the 20,800 kings Jarāsandha had imprisoned, they immediately fell to the ground to pay Him obeisances. Then they stood with joined palms and began to pray to Him. Seeing their imprisonment as an act of mercy by the Lord to smash their false pride, the kings prayed only to be granted whatever would facilitate their perpetual remembrance of His lotus feet.

The Lord assured the kings that their prayer would be fulfilled. He instructed them, “Worship Me by performing Vedic sacrifices, and protect your subjects in accordance with the principles of religion. Fixing your minds on Me, beget progeny, and remain always equipoised in happiness and distress. Thus at the end of your lives you will surely attain Me.”

Lord Kṛṣṇa then saw to it that the kings were properly bathed and dressed, and He had Sahadeva offer them flower garlands, sandalwood pulp, fine clothing and other things suitable for kings. After having them adorned with jewels and golden ornaments, He seated them on chariots and sent them off to their respective kingdoms. In accordance with the orders the Lord had given them, they began to carry out their various duties once again.

Lord Kṛṣṇa, Bhīma and Arjuna then departed for Indraprastha, where they met with King Yudhiṣṭhira and related to him everything that had happened.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Jarāsandha had defeated 20,800 kings in combat and thrown them into prison. As these kings emerged from the Giridroṇī fortress, they appeared dirty and shabbily dressed. They were emaciated by hunger, their faces were dried up, and they were greatly weakened by their long imprisonment.**

### Purport

**The kings then beheld the Lord before them. His complexion was dark blue like the color of a cloud, and He wore a yellow silk garment. He was distinguished by the Śrīvatsa mark on His chest, His four mighty arms, the pinkish hue of His eyes, which resembled the whorl of a lotus, His lovely, cheerful face, His gleaming makara earrings and the lotus, club, conchshell and disc in His hands. A helmet, a jeweled necklace, a golden belt, and golden bracelets and armlets decorated His form, and on His neck He wore both the brilliant, precious Kaustubha gem and a garland of forest flowers. The kings seemed to drink His beauty with their eyes, lick Him with their tongues, relish His fragrance with their nostrils and embrace Him with their arms. Their past sins now eradicated, the kings all bowed down to Lord Hari, placing their heads at His feet.**

*namas te deva-deveśa  
prapannārti-harāvyaya  
prapannān pāhi naḥ kṛṣṇa

### Devanagari

नैनं नाथानुसूयामो मागधं मधुसूदन ।  
अनुग्रहो यद् भवतो राज्ञां राज्यच्युतिर्विभो ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

anugraho yad bhavato

### Translation

### Purport

It is significant that upon seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus becoming purified of their sins, the kings did not feel any mundane hatred or bitterness toward Jarāsandha, who had imprisoned them. Simply by seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa, the kings came to the position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spoke these verses, which show deep spiritual wisdom.

## Text 10

### Devanagari

राज्यैश्वर्यमदोन्नद्धो न श्रेयो विन्दते नृप- ।  
त्वन्मायामोहितोऽनित्या मन्यते सम्पदोऽचला- ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*rājyaiśvarya-madonnaddho  
na śreyo vindate nṛpaḥ  
tvan-māyā-mohito ’nityā  
manyate sampado ’calāḥ*

### Synonyms

*rājya* — with sovereignty; *aiśvarya* — and opulence; *mada* — by the intoxication; *unnaddhaḥ* — becoming unrestrained; *na* — does not; *śreyaḥ* — real benefit; *vindate* — obtain; *nṛpaḥ* — a king; *tvat* — Your; *māyā* — by the potency of illusion; *mohitaḥ* — deluded; *anityāḥ* — temporary; *manyate* — he thinks; *sampadaḥ* — assets; *acalāḥ* — permanent.

### Translation

**Infatuated with his opulence and ruling power, a king loses all self-restraint and cannot obtain his true welfare. Thus bewildered by Your illusory energy, he imagines his temporary assets to be permanent.**

### Purport

The word *unnaddha* indicates that one who is intoxicated by false pride goes beyond the boundaries of proper behavior. Human life is meant to be governed by *dharma,* spiritual principles for gradual advancement to the perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Blinded by wealth and power, however, a foolish person does not hesitate to act whimsically, against the laws of nature and God. Unfortunately, this is now the situation in the prosperous Western countries.

### Translation

**Previously, blinded by the intoxication of riches, we wanted to conquer this earth, and thus we fought one another to achieve victory, mercilessly harassing our own subjects. We arrogantly disregarded You, O Lord, who stood before us as death. But now, O Kṛṣṇa, that powerful form of Yours called time, moving mysteriously and irresistibly, has deprived us of our opulences. Now that You have mercifully destroyed our pride, we beg simply to remember Your lotus feet.**

अथो न राज्यं मृगतृष्णिरूपितं  
देहेन शश्वत् पतता रुजां भुवा ।

### Verse text

*atho na rājyam mṛga-tṛṣṇi-rūpitaṁ  
dehena śaśvat patatā rujāṁ bhuvā  
upāsitavyaṁ spṛhayāmahe vibho  
kriyā-phalaṁ pretya ca karṇa-rocanam*

### Synonyms

*atha* *u* — henceforward; *na* — not; *rājyam* — kingdom; *mṛga*-*tṛṣṇi* — like a mirage; *rūpitam* — which appears; *dehena* — by the material body; *śaśvat* — perpetually; *patatā* — subject to demise; *rujām* — of diseases; *bhuvā* — the birthplace; *upāsitavyam* — to be served; *spṛhayāmahe* — do we hanker for; *vibho* — O almighty Lord; *kriyā* — of pious work; *phalam* — the fruit; *pretya* — having passed to the next life; *ca* — and; *karṇa* — for the ears; *rocanam* — enticement.

### Translation

**Never again will we hanker for a miragelike kingdom — a kingdom that must be slavishly served by this mortal body, which is simply a source of disease and suffering and which is declining at every moment. Nor, O almighty Lord, will we hanker to enjoy the heavenly fruits of pious work in the next life, since the promise of such rewards is simply an empty enticement for the ears.**

### Purport

One must work very hard to maintain a kingdom or political sovereignty. And yet the body, which works so hard to maintain one’s political power, is itself doomed. At every moment the mortal body moves toward death, and all along the way the body is subject to many painful diseases. The whole affair of mundane power is thus a waste of time for the pure soul, who needs to revive his dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The Vedic scriptures and other religious scriptures contain many promises of prosperity and heavenly enjoyment in the next life for one who acts piously in this life. Such promises are pleasing to the ears, but they are nothing more than that. Material enjoyment, whether in heaven or in hell, is a type of illusion for the pure soul. By the personal association of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the fortunate kings have now realized the higher spiritual reality beyond the phantasmagoria of the material creation.

## Text 15

### Devanagari

तं न- समादिशोपायं येन ते चरणाब्जयो- ।

### Verse text

*taṁ naḥ samādiśopāyaṁ  
yena te caraṇābjayoḥ  
smṛtir yathā na viramed  
api saṁsaratām iha*

### Synonyms

*tam* — that; *naḥ* — to us; *samādiśa* — please instruct; *upāyam* — the means; *yena* — by which; *te* — Your; *caraṇa* — of the feet; *abjayoḥ* — lotuslike; *smṛtiḥ* — remembrance; *yathā* — as; *na* *viramet* — may not cease; *api* — even; *saṁsaratām* — for those traveling through the cycle of birth and death; *iha* — in this world.

### Translation

**Please tell us how we may constantly remember Your lotus feet, though we continue in the cycle of birth and death in this world.**

### Purport

One can constantly remember the Lord only by His mercy. Such remembrance is the easy method to obtain supreme liberation, as explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.14):

*ananya-cetāḥ satataṁ  
yo māṁ smarati nityaśaḥ  
tasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ pārtha  
nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ*

“For one who always remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Pṛthā, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.”

The words *api saṁsaratām iha* indicate that the kings were approaching Lord Kṛṣṇa not merely for liberation but rather for the boon of always being able to remember His lotus feet. Such constant remembrance is a symptom of love, and love of Godhead is the actual goal of life.

हैहयो नहुषो वेणो रावणो नरकोऽपरे ।

### Verse text

*haihayo nahuṣo veṇo  
rāvaṇo narako ’pare  
śrī-madād bhraṁśitāḥ sthānād  
deva-daitya-nareśvarāḥ*

### Synonyms

*haihayaḥ* *nahuṣaḥ* *veṇaḥ* — Haihaya (Kārtavīrya), Nahuṣa and Veṇa; *rāvaṇaḥ* *narakaḥ* — Rāvaṇa and Naraka; *apare* — others also; *śrī* — due to opulence; *madāt* — because of their intoxication; *bhraṁśitāḥ* — made to fall; *sthānāt* — from their positions; *deva* — of demigods; *daitya* — demons; *nara* — and men; *īśvarāḥ* — rulers.

### Translation

**Haihaya, Nahuṣa, Veṇa, Rāvaṇa, Naraka and many other rulers of demigods, men and demons fell from their elevated positions because of infatuation with material opulence.**

### Purport

As described by Śrīdhara Svāmī, because Haihaya stole the desire cow of Lord Paraśurāma’s father, Jamadagni, Paraśurāma killed him and his impudent sons. Nahuṣa became puffed up when he temporarily assumed the post of Indra. When out of pride Nahuṣa ordered some *brāhmaṇas* to carry him in a palanquin to an illicit meeting with Lord Indra’s chaste wife, Śacī, the *brāhmaṇas* made him fall down from his position and become an old man. King Vena was similarly mad, and when he insulted the *brāhmaṇas* they killed him by loud incantations of the syllable *hum.* Rāvaṇa was a famous ruler of the Rākṣasas, but out of lust he kidnapped Mother Sītā, and thus her husband, Lord Rāmacandra, killed him. Naraka was a ruler of the Daityas who dared to steal Mother Aditi’s earrings, and for his offense he was also killed. Thus throughout history powerful leaders have fallen from their positions because they became intoxicated with their so-called opulence.
