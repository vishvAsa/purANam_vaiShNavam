सान्द्रनीलाम्बुदैर्व्योम सविद्युत्स्तनयित्नुभि- ।  
अस्पष्टज्योतिराच्छन्नं ब्रह्मेव सगुणं बभौ ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*sāndra-nīlāmbudair vyoma  
sa-vidyut-stanayitnubhiḥ  
aspaṣṭa-jyotir ācchannaṁ  
brahmeva sa-guṇaṁ babhau*

### Synonyms

*sāndra* — dense; *nīla* — blue; *ambudaiḥ* — by the clouds; *vyoma* — the sky; *sa*-*vidyut* — along with lightning; *stanayitnubhiḥ* — and thunder; *aspaṣṭa* — diffuse; *jyotiḥ* — its illumination; *ācchannam* — covered; *brahma* — the spirit soul; *iva* — as if; *sa*-*guṇam* — with the material qualities of nature; *babhau* — was manifest.

### Translation

**The sky was then covered by dense blue clouds accompanied by lightning and thunder. Thus the sky and its natural illumination were covered in the same way that the spirit soul is covered by the three modes of material nature.**

### Purport

Lightning is compared to the mode of goodness, thunder to the mode of passion, and clouds to the mode of ignorance. Thus the cloudy sky at the onset of the rainy season is analogous to the pure spirit soul when he becomes disturbed by the modes of nature, for at that time he is covered and his original brilliant nature is only dimly reflected through the haze of the material qualities.

अष्टौ मासान् निपीतं यद् भूम्याश्चोदमयं वसु ।  
स्वगोभिर्मोक्तुमारेभे पर्जन्य- काल आगते ॥ ५ ॥

### Verse text

*aṣṭau māsān nipītaṁ yad  
bhūmyāś coda-mayaṁ vasu  
sva-gobhir moktum ārebhe  
parjanyaḥ kāla āgate*

### Synonyms

*aṣṭau* — eight; *māsān* — during months; *nipītam* — drunk; *yat* — which; *bhūmyāḥ* — of the earth; *ca* — and; *uda*-*mayam* — consisting of water; *vasu* — the wealth; *sva*-*gobhiḥ* — by his own rays; *moktum* — to release; *ārebhe* — began; *parjanyaḥ* — the sun; *kāle* — the proper time; *āgate* — when it arrived.

### Translation

**With its rays, the sun had for eight months drunk up the earth’s wealth in the form of water. Now that the proper time had arrived, the sun began releasing this accumulated wealth.**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* compare the sun’s evaporating the earth’s wealth of water to a king’s collecting taxes. In Chapter Twenty, of *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda explains this analogy as follows: “Clouds are accumulated water drawn from the land by the sunshine. Continually for eight months the sun evaporates all kinds of water from the surface of the globe, and this water is accumulated in the shape of clouds, which are distributed as water when there is need. Similarly, a government exacts various taxes from the citizens, such as income tax and sales tax, which the citizens are able to pay by their different material activities: agriculture, trade, industry and so on. This taxation is compared to the sun’s drawing water from the earth. When there is again need of water on the surface of the globe, the same sunshine converts the water into clouds and distributes it all over the globe. Similarly, the taxes collected by the government must be distributed to the people again, as educational work, public work, sanitation work and so on. This is very essential for a good government. The government should not simply exact taxes for useless squandering; the tax collection should be utilized for the public welfare of the state.”

तडिद्वन्तो महामेघाश्चण्डश्वसनवेपिता- ।  
प्रीणनं जीवनं ह्यस्य मुमुचु- करुणा इव ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*taḍidvanto mahā-meghāś  
caṇḍa-śvasana-vepitāḥ  
prīṇanaṁ jīvanaṁ hy asya  
mumucuḥ karuṇā iva*

### Synonyms

*taḍit*-*vantaḥ* — displaying lightning; *mahā*-*meghāḥ* — the great clouds; *caṇḍa* — fierce; *śvasana* — by the wind; *vepitāḥ* — shaken; *prīṇanam* — the gratification; *jīvanam* — their life (their water); *hi* — indeed; *asya* — of this world; *mumucuḥ* — they released; *karuṇāḥ* — merciful personalities; *iva* — just as.

### Translation

**Flashing with lightning, great clouds were shaken and swept about by fierce winds. Just like merciful persons, the clouds gave their lives for the pleasure of this world.**

### Purport

Just as great, compassionate personalities sometimes give their lives or wealth for the happiness of society, the rain clouds poured down their rain upon the parched earth. Although the clouds were thus dissipated, they freely provided rainfall for the happiness of the earth.

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda comments as follows on this verse: “During the rainy season, there are strong winds blustering all over the country and carrying clouds from one place to another to distribute water. When water is urgently needed after the summer season, the clouds are just like a rich man who, in times of need, distributes his money even by exhausting his whole treasury. So the clouds exhaust themselves by distributing water all over the surface of the globe.

“When Mahārāja Daśaratha, the father of Lord Rāmacandra, used to fight with his enemies, it was said that he approached them just like a farmer uprooting unnecessary plants and trees. And when there was need of giving charity, he used to distribute money exactly as the cloud distributes rain. The distribution of rain by clouds is so sumptuous that it is compared to the distribution of wealth by a great, munificent person. The clouds' downpour is so sufficient that the rains even fall on rocks and hills and on the oceans and seas where there is no need for water. It is like a charitable person who opens his treasury for distribution and who does not discriminate whether the charity is needed or not. He gives in charity openhandedly.”

Metaphorically speaking, the lightning in rain clouds is the light by which they see the distressed condition of the earth, and the blowing winds are their heavy breathing, such as that found in a distressed person. Distressed to see the condition of the earth, the clouds tremble in the wind like a compassionate person. Thus they pour down their rain.

तप-कृशा देवमीढा आसीद् वर्षीयसी मही ।  
यथैव काम्यतपसस्तनु- सम्प्राप्य तत्फलम् ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*tapaḥ-kṛśā deva-mīḍhā  
āsīd varṣīyasī mahī  
yathaiva kāmya-tapasas  
tanuḥ samprāpya tat-phalam*

### Synonyms

*tapaḥ*-*kṛśā* — emaciated by the summer heat; *deva*-*mīḍhā* — mercifully sprinkled by the god of rain; *āsīt* — became; *varṣīyasī* — fully nourished; *mahī* — the earth; *yathā* *eva* — just as; *kāmya* — based on sense gratification; *tapasaḥ* — of one whose austerities; *tanuḥ* — the body; *samprāpya* — after obtaining; *tat* — of those austere practices; *phalam* — the fruit.

### Translation

**The earth had been emaciated by the summer heat, but she became fully nourished again when moistened by the god of rain. Thus the earth was like a person whose body has been emaciated by austerities undergone for a material purpose, but who again becomes fully nourished when he achieves the fruit of those austerities.**

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda comments on this verse as follows: “Before the rainfall, the whole surface of the globe becomes almost depleted of all kinds of energies and appears very lean. After the rainfall, the whole surface of the earth becomes green with vegetation and appears very healthy and strong. Here a comparison is made to the person undergoing austerities for fulfillment of a material desire. The flourishing condition of the earth after a rainy season is compared to the fulfillment of material desires. Sometimes, when a country is subjugated by an undesirable government, persons and parties undergo severe penances and austerities to get control of the government, and when they attain control they flourish by giving themselves generous salaries. This also is like the flourishing of the earth in the rainy season. Actually, one should undergo severe austerities and penances only to achieve spiritual happiness. In the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* it is recommended that *tapasya,* or austerity, should be accepted for realizing the Supreme Lord. By accepting austerity in devotional service, one regains his spiritual life, and as soon as one regains his spiritual life, he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. But if someone undertakes austerities and penances for some material gain, it is stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* that the results are temporary and are desired only by persons of less intelligence.”

निशामुखेषु खद्योतास्तमसा भान्ति न ग्रहा- ।  
यथा पापेन पाषण्डा न हि वेदा- कलौ युगे ॥ ८ ॥

### Verse text

*niśā-mukheṣu khadyotās  
tamasā bhānti na grahāḥ  
yathā pāpena pāṣaṇḍā  
na hi vedāḥ kalau yuge*

### Synonyms

*niśā*-*mukheṣu* — during the moments of evening twilight; *khadyotāḥ* — the glowworms; *tamasā* — because of the darkness; *bhānti* — shine; *na* — not; *grahāḥ* — the planets; *yathā* — as; *pāpena* — because of sinful activities; *pāṣaṇḍāḥ* — atheistic doctrines; *na* — and not; *hi* — certainly; *vedāḥ* — the *Vedas*; *kalau* *yuge* — in the Age of Kali.

### Translation

**In the evening twilight during the rainy season, the darkness allowed the glowworms but not the stars to shine forth, just as in the Age of Kali the predominance of sinful activities allows atheistic doctrines to overshadow the true knowledge of the Vedas.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments as follows: “During the rainy season, in the evening there are many glowworms visible about the tops of trees, hither and thither, and they glitter just like lights. But the luminaries of the sky — the stars and the moon — are not visible. Similarly, in the Age of Kali, persons who are atheists or miscreants become very prominently visible, whereas persons who are actually following the Vedic principles for spiritual emancipation are practically obscured. This age, Kali-yuga, is compared to the cloudy season of the living entities. In this age, real knowledge is covered by the influence of the material advancement of civilization. The cheap mental speculators, atheists and manufacturers of so-called religious principles become prominent like the glowworms, whereas persons strictly following the Vedic principles or scriptural injunctions become covered by the clouds of this age. People should learn to take advantage of the actual luminaries of the sky — the sun, moon and stars — instead of the glowworms’ light. Actually, the glowworms cannot give any light in the darkness of night. As clouds sometimes clear, even in the rainy season, and sometimes the moon, stars and sun become visible, so even in this Kali-yuga there are sometimes advantages. The Vedic movement of Lord Caitanya — the distribution of the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra —* is understood in this way. People seriously eager to find real light should take advantage of this movement instead of looking toward the light of mental speculators and atheists.”

श्रुत्वा पर्जन्यनिनदं मण्डुका- ससृजुर्गिर- ।  
तूष्णीं शयाना- प्राग् यद्वद्ब्राह्मणा नियमात्यये ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*śrutvā parjanya-ninadaṁ  
maṇḍukāḥ sasṛjur giraḥ  
tūṣṇīṁ śayānāḥ prāg yadvad  
brāhmaṇā niyamātyaye*

### Synonyms

*śrutvā* — hearing; *parjanya* — of the rain clouds; *ninadam* — the resounding; *maṇḍukāḥ* — the frogs; *sasṛjuḥ* — emitted; *giraḥ* — their sounds; *tūṣṇīm* — silently; *śayānāḥ* — lying; *prāk* — previously; *yadvat* — just as; *brāhmaṇāḥ* — *brāhmaṇa* students; *niyama*-*atyaye* — after finishing their morning duties.

### Translation

**The frogs, who had all along been lying silent, suddenly began croaking when they heard the rumbling of the rain clouds, in the same way that brāhmaṇa students, who perform their morning duties in silence begin reciting their lessons when called by their teacher.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “After the first rainfall, when there is a thundering sound in the clouds, all the frogs begin to croak, like students suddenly engaged in reading their studies. Students are generally supposed to rise early in the morning. They do not usually arise of their own accord, however, but only when there is a bell sounded in the temple or other spiritual institution. By the order of the spiritual master they immediately rise, and after finishing their morning duties they sit down to study the *Vedas* or chant Vedic *mantras.* Everyone is sleeping in the darkness of Kali-yuga, but when there is a great *ācārya,* by his calling only everyone takes to the study of the *Vedas* to acquire actual knowledge.”

*āsann utpatha-gāminyaḥ  
kṣudra-nadyo ’nuśuṣyatīḥ  
puṁso yathāsvatantrasya  
deha-draviṇa-sampadaḥ*

### Synonyms

*āsan* — they became; *utpatha*-*gāminyaḥ* — strayed from their courses; *kṣudra* — insignificant; *nadyaḥ* — the rivers; *anuśuṣyatīḥ* — drying up; *puṁsaḥ* — of a person; *yathā* — as; *asvatantrasya* — who is not independent (that is, who is under the control of his senses); *deha* — the body; *draviṇa* — physical property; *sampadaḥ* — and riches.

### Translation

**With the advent of the rainy season, the insignificant streams, which had become dry, began to swell and then strayed from their proper courses, like the body, property and money of a man controlled by the urges of his senses.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “During the rainy season, many small ponds, lakes and rivulets become filled with water; otherwise the rest of the year they remain dry. Similarly, materialistic persons are dry, but sometimes, when they are in a so-called opulent position, with a home or children or a little bank balance, they appear to be flourishing, but immediately afterwards they become dry again, like the small rivulets and ponds. The poet Vidyāpati said that in the society of friends, family, children, wife, etc., there is certainly some pleasure, but that pleasure is compared to a drop of water in the desert. Everyone is hankering after happiness, just as in the desert everyone is hankering after water. If in the desert there is a drop of water, it may of course be said that the water is there, but the benefit from that drop of water is very insignificant. In our materialistic way of life, which is just like a desert, we are hankering after an ocean of happiness, but in the form of society, friends and mundane love we are getting no more than a drop of water. Our satisfaction is never achieved, as the small rivulets, lakes and ponds are never filled with water in the dry season.”

*haritā haribhiḥ śaṣpair  
indragopaiś ca lohitā  
ucchilīndhra-kṛta-cchāyā  
nṛṇāṁ śrīr iva bhūr abhūt*

### Synonyms

*haritāḥ* — greenish; *haribhiḥ* — which is green; *śaṣpaiḥ* — because of the newly grown grass; *indragopaiḥ* — because of the *indragopa* insects; *ca* — and; *lohitā* — reddish; *ucchilīndhra* — by the mushrooms; *kṛta* — afforded; *chāyā* — shelter; *nṛṇām* — of men; *śrīḥ* — the opulence; *iva* — just as; *bhūḥ* — the earth; *abhūt* — became.

### Translation

**The newly grown grass made the earth emerald green, the indragopa insects added a reddish hue, and white mushrooms added further color and circles of shade. Thus the earth appeared like a person who has suddenly become rich.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī comments that the word *nṛṇām* indicates men of the royal order. Thus the colorful display of dark green fields decorated with bright red insects and white mushroom umbrellas can be compared to a royal parade displaying the military strength of a king.

*kṣetrāṇi śaṣya-sampadbhiḥ  
karṣakāṇāṁ mudaṁ daduḥ  
māninām anutāpaṁ vai  
daivādhīnam ajānatām*

### Synonyms

*kṣetrāṇi* — the fields; *śaṣya*-*sampadbhiḥ* — with their wealth of grains; *karṣakāṇām* — to the farmers; *mudam* — joy; *daduḥ* — gave; *māninām* — to others who are falsely proud; *anutāpam* — remorse; *vai* — indeed; *daiva*-*adhīnam* — the control of destiny; *ajānatām* — not understanding.

### Translation

**With their wealth of grains, the fields gave joy to the farmers. But those fields created remorse in the hearts of those who were too proud to engage in farming and who failed to understand how everything is under the control of the Supreme.**

### Purport

It is common for people living in large cities to become miserable and disgusted when there is ample rainfall. They do not understand or have forgotten that the rain is nourishing the crops they will eat. Although they certainly enjoy eating, they do not appreciate that with the rain the Supreme Lord is feeding not only human beings but also plants, animals and the earth itself.

Modern, sophisticated people often look down their noses at those engaged in agricultural work. In fact, in American slang, a simple, unintelligent person is sometimes called “a farmer.” There are also government agencies that restrict agricultural production because certain capitalists fear the effect on market prices. Because of various artificial and manipulative practices in modern governments, we find widespread food shortages throughout the world — even in the United States, among the poverty-stricken — and at the same time we find the governments paying farmers not to plant crops. Sometimes these governments throw huge amounts of food into the ocean. Thus the administration of the arrogant and ignorant, those who are too proud to obey the laws of God or too ignorant to recognize them, will always cause frustration among the people, whereas a God conscious government will provide abundance and happiness for all.

nava-vāri-niṣevayā

### Synonyms

*jala* — of the water; *sthala* — and the land; *okasaḥ* — the residents; *sarve* — all; *nava* — new; *vāri* — of the water; *niṣevayā* — by taking recourse; *abibhran* — they took on; *ruciram* — attractive; *rūpam* — form; *yathā* — just as; *hari*-*niṣevayā* — by rendering devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**As all creatures of the land and water took advantage of the newly fallen rainwater, their forms became attractive and pleasing, just as a devotee becomes beautiful by engaging in the service of the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments as follows: “We have practical experience of this with our students in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Before becoming students, they were dirty-looking, although they had naturally beautiful personal features; but due to having no information of Kṛṣṇa consciousness they appeared very dirty and wretched. Since they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their health has improved, and by their following the rules and regulations their bodily luster has increased. When they are dressed with saffron-colored cloth, with *tilaka* on their foreheads and beads in their hands and on their necks, they look exactly as if they have come directly from Vaikuṇṭha.”

### Translation

**Where the rivers joined the ocean it became agitated, its waves blown about by the wind, just as the mind of an immature yogī becomes agitated because he is still tainted by lust and attached to the objects of sense gratification.**

*girayo varṣa-dhārābhir  
hanyamānā na vivyathuḥ  
abhibhūyamānā vyasanair

### Synonyms

*girayaḥ* — the mountains; *varṣa*-*dhārābhiḥ* — by the rain-bearing clouds; *hanyamānāḥ* — being struck; *na* *vivyathuḥ* — did not shake; *abhibhūyamānāḥ* — being attacked; *vyasanaiḥ* — by dangers; *yathā* — as; *adhokṣaja*-*cetasaḥ* — those whose minds are absorbed in the Supreme Lord.

### Translation

**Just as devotees whose minds are absorbed in the Personality of Godhead remain peaceful even when attacked by all sorts of dangers, the mountains in the rainy season were not at all disturbed by the repeated striking of the rain-bearing clouds.**

### Purport

When splashed by torrents of rain, the mountains are not shaken; rather, they are cleansed of dirt and become resplendent and beautiful. Similarly, an advanced devotee of the Supreme Lord is not shaken from his devotional program by disturbing conditions, which instead cleanse his heart of the dust of attachment to this world. Thus the devotee becomes beautiful and resplendent by tolerating difficult conditions. In fact, a devotee accepts all reverses in life as the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, realizing that all suffering is due to the sufferer’s own previous misdeeds.

### Synonyms

*mārgāḥ* — the roads; *babhūvuḥ* — became; *sandigdhāḥ* — obscured; *tṛṇaiḥ* — by grass; *channāḥ* — covered over; *hi* — indeed; *asaṁskṛtāḥ* — not cleansed; *na* *abhyasyamānāḥ* — not being studied; *śrutayaḥ* — the scriptures; *dvijaiḥ* — by the *brāhmaṇas*; *kālena* — by the effects of time; *ca* — and; *āhatāḥ* — corrupted.

### Translation

**During the rainy season the roads, not being cleansed, became covered with grass and debris and were thus difficult to make out. These roads were like religious scriptures that brāhmaṇas no longer study and that thus become corrupted and covered over with the passage of time.**

### Synonyms

*loka* — of all the world; *bandhuṣu* — who are the friends; *megheṣu* — among the clouds; *vidyutaḥ* — the lightning; *cala*-*sauhṛdāḥ* — fickle in their friendship; *sthairyam* — steadiness; *na* *cakruḥ* — did not maintain; *kāminyaḥ* — lusty women; *puruṣeṣu* — among men; *guṇiṣu* — who are virtuous; *iva* — as.

### Translation

**Though the clouds are the well-wishing friends of all living beings, the lightning, fickle in its affinities, moved from one group of clouds to another, like lusty women unfaithful even to virtuous men.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “During the rainy season, lightning appears in one group of clouds and then immediately in another group of clouds. This phenomenon is compared to a lusty woman who does not fix her mind on one man. A cloud is compared to a qualified person because it pours rain and gives sustenance to many people; a man who is qualified similarly gives sustenance to many living creatures, such as family members or many workers in business. Unfortunately, his whole life can be disturbed by a wife who divorces him; when the husband is disturbed, the whole family is ruined, the children are dispersed or the business is closed, and everything is affected. It is therefore recommended that a woman desiring to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness peacefully live with a husband and that the couple not separate under any condition. The husband and wife should control sex indulgence and concentrate their minds on Kṛṣṇa consciousness so their life may be successful. After all, in the material world a man requires a woman and a woman requires a man. When they are combined, they should live peacefully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and should not be restless like the lightning, flashing from one group of clouds to another.”

धनुर्वियति माहेन्द्रं निर्गुणं च गुणिन्यभात् ।

### Verse text

*dhanur viyati māhendraṁ  
nirguṇaṁ ca guṇiny abhāt  
vyakte guṇa-vyatikare  
’guṇavān puruṣo yathā*

### Synonyms

*dhanuḥ* — the bow (rainbow); *viyati* — within the sky; *māhā*-*indram* — of Lord Indra; *nirguṇam* — without qualities (or without a bowstring); *ca* — although; *guṇini* — within the sky, which has definite qualities like sound; *abhāt* — appeared; *vyakte* — within the manifest material nature; *guṇa*-*vyatikare* — which consists of the interactions of material qualities; *aguṇa*-*vān* — He who has no contact with material qualities; *puruṣaḥ* — the Supreme Personality; *yathā* — just as.

### Translation

**When the curved bow of Indra \[the rainbow\] appeared in the sky, which had the quality of thundering sound, it was unlike ordinary bows because it did not rest upon a string. Similarly, when the Supreme Lord appears in this world, which is the interaction of the material qualities, He is unlike ordinary persons because He remains free from all material qualities and independent of all material conditions.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments as follows: “Sometimes, in addition to the roaring thunder of the clouds, there is an appearance of a rainbow, which stands as a bow without a string. Actually, a bow is in the curved position because it is tied at its two ends by the bowstring; but in the rainbow there is no such string, and yet it rests in the sky so beautifully. Similarly, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends to this material world, He appears just like an ordinary human being, but He is not resting on any material condition. In the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the Lord says that He appears by His internal potency, which is free from the bondage of the external potency. What is bondage for the ordinary creature is freedom for the Personality of Godhead.”

न रराजोडुपश्छन्न- स्वज्योत्स्‍नाराजितैर्घनै- ।

### Verse text

*na rarājoḍupaś channaḥ  
sva-jyotsnā-rājitair ghanaiḥ  
ahaṁ-matyā bhāsitayā  
sva-bhāsā puruṣo yathā*

### Synonyms

*na* *rarāja* — did not shine forth; *uḍupaḥ* — the moon; *channaḥ* — covered; *sva*-*jyotsnā* — by its own light; *rājitaiḥ* — which are illuminated; *ghanaiḥ* — by the clouds; *aham*-*matyā* — by false ego; *bhāsitayā* — which is illuminated; *sva*-*bhāsā* — by his own luster; *puruṣaḥ* — the living entity; *yathā* — as.

### Translation

**During the rainy season the moon was prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the clouds, which were themselves illumined by the moon’s rays. Similarly, the living being in material existence is prevented from appearing directly by the covering of the false ego, which is itself illumined by the consciousness of the pure soul.**

### Purport

The analogy given here is excellent. During the rainy season we cannot see the moon in the sky, because the moon is covered by clouds. These clouds, however, are radiant with the glow of the moon’s own rays. Similarly, in our conditioned, material existence we cannot directly perceive the soul, because our consciousness is covered by the false ego, which is the false identification with the material world and the material body. Yet it is the soul’s own consciousness that illumines the false ego.

As the *Gītā* describes, the energy of the soul is consciousness, and when this consciousness manifests through the screen of false ego, it appears as dull, material consciousness, in which there is no direct vision of the soul or God. In the material world, even great philosophers ultimately resort to hazy ambiguities when speaking about the Absolute Truth, just as the cloudy sky manifests only in a dull and indirect way the iridescent light of the moon.

In material life, our false ego is often enthusiastic, hopeful and apparently aware of various material affairs, and such consciousness encourages us to push on in material existence. But in truth we are merely experiencing the dull reflection of our original, pure consciousness, which is Kṛṣṇa consciousness — direct perception of the soul and God. Not realizing that the false ego merely hampers and dulls our real, spiritual consciousness, which is fully enlightened and blissful, we mistakenly think that material consciousness is full of knowledge and happiness. This is comparable to thinking that the luminous clouds are lighting up the night sky, while in fact it is the moonshine that illumines the sky, and the clouds that merely dull and hamper the moonshine. The clouds appear luminous because they are filtering and impeding the brilliant rays of the moon. Similarly, at times material consciousness appears pleasurable or enlightened because it is screening or filtering the original, blissful and enlightened consciousness coming directly from the soul. If we can understand the ingenious analogy given in this verse, we can easily advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Synonyms

*megha* — of clouds; *āgama* — because of the arrival; *utsavāḥ* — who celebrate a festival; *hṛṣṭāḥ* — becoming joyful; *pratyanandan* — they cried out in greeting; *śikhaṇḍinaḥ* — the peacocks; *gṛheṣu* — within their homes; *tapta* — those who are distressed; *nirviṇṇāḥ* — and then become happy; *yathā* — just as; *acyuta* — of the infallible Personality of Godhead; *jana* — of the devotees; *āgame* — upon the arrival.

### Translation

**The peacocks became festive and cried out a joyful greeting when they saw the clouds arrive, just as people distressed in household life feel pleasure when the pure devotees of the infallible Supreme Lord visit them.**

### Purport

After the dry summer season, the peacocks become jubilant with the arrival of the first thundering rain clouds, and thus they dance in great happiness. Śrīla Prabhupāda comments, “We have practical experience of this: many of our students were dry and morose previous to their coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but having come into contact with devotees they are now dancing like jubilant peacocks.”

*pītvāpaḥ pādapāḥ padbhir  
āsan nānātma-mūrtayaḥ  
prāk kṣāmās tapasā śrāntā  
yathā kāmānusevayā*

### Synonyms

*pītvā* — having drunk; *āpaḥ* — water; *pāda*-*pāḥ* — the trees; *padbhiḥ* — with their feet; *āsan* — assumed; *nānā* — various; *ātma*-*mūrtayaḥ* — bodily features; *prāk* — previously; *kṣāmāḥ* — emaciated; *tapasā* — by austerities; *śrāntāḥ* — fatigued; *yathā* — as; *kāma*-*anusevayā* — by enjoying acquired desired objects.

### Translation

**The trees had grown thin and dry, but after they drank the newly fallen rainwater through their feet, their various bodily features blossomed. Similarly, one whose body has grown thin and weak from austerity again exhibits his healthy bodily features upon enjoying the material objects gained through that austerity.**

### Purport

The word *pāda* means foot, and *pā* means drinking. Trees are called *pādapa* because they drink through their roots, which are likened to feet. Upon drinking the newly fallen rainwater, the trees in Vṛndāvana began to manifest new leaves, sprouts and blossoms, and they thus enjoyed new growth. Similarly, materialistic persons often perform severe austerities to acquire the object of their desire. For example, politicians in America undergo grueling austerities while traveling about the countryside campaigning for election. Businessmen also will often deny personal comfort to make their business successful. Such austere persons, upon acquiring the fruits of their austerity, again become healthy and satisfied, like trees eagerly drinking rainwater after enduring the austerity of a dry, hot summer.

### Translation

**The cranes continued dwelling on the shores of the lakes, although the shores were agitated during the rainy season, just as materialistic persons with contaminated minds always remain at home, despite the many disturbances there.**

### Purport

During the rainy season there are often mud slides around the shores of lakes, and thorny bushes, stones and other debris sometimes accumulate there. Despite all these inconveniences, ducks and cranes continue meandering around the lakeshores. Similarly, innumerable painful occurrences are always disturbing family life, but a materialistic man never even considers leaving his family in the hands of his grown sons and going away for spiritual improvement. He regards such an idea as shocking and uncivilized, because he is completely ignorant of the Absolute Truth and his relationship to that Truth.

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “In the rainy season, the clouds, tossed by the wind, deliver water, which is welcomed like nectar. When the Vedic followers, the *brāhmaṇas,* inspire rich men like kings and the wealthy mercantile community to give charity in the performance of great sacrifices, the distribution of such wealth is also nectarean. The four sections of human society, namely the *brāhmaṇas,* the *kṣatriyas,* the *vaiśyas* and the *śūdras,* are meant to live peacefully in a cooperative mood; this is possible when they are guided by expert Vedic *brāhmaṇas* who perform sacrifices and distribute wealth equally.”

*vyomnaḥ* — in the sky; *ap*-*bhram* — the clouds; *bhūta* — of the animals; *śābalyam* — the crowded condition; *bhuvaḥ* — of the earth; *paṅkam* — the muddy covering; *apām* — of the water; *malam* — the contamination; *śarat* — the autumn season; *jahāra* — removed; *āśramiṇām* — of the members of the four different spiritual orders of human society; *kṛṣṇe* — for Lord Kṛṣṇa; *bhaktiḥ* — devotional service; *yathā* — just as; *aśubham* — all inauspiciousness.

### Translation

**Autumn cleared the sky of clouds, let the animals get out of their crowded living conditions, cleaned the earth of its covering of mud, and purified the water of contamination, in the same way that loving service rendered to Lord Kṛṣṇa frees the members of the four spiritual orders from their respective troubles.**

### Purport

Every human being must perform the prescribed duties corresponding to one of the four spiritual orders of life. These divisions are 1) celibate student life, *brahmacarya;* 2) married life, *gṛhastha;* 3) retired life, *vānaprastha;* and 4) renounced life, *sannyāsa.* A *brahmacārī* must perform many menial duties during his student life, but as he becomes advanced in loving service to Kṛṣṇa, his superiors recognize his spiritual status and elevate him to higher duties. The innumerable obligations performed on behalf of wife and children constantly harass a householder, but as he becomes advanced in loving service to Kṛṣṇa, he is automatically elevated by the laws of nature to more enjoyable, spiritual occupations, and he somehow minimizes material duties.

Those in the *vānaprastha,* or retired, order of life also perform many duties, and these can also be replaced by ecstatic loving service to Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, renounced life has many natural difficulties, not the least of which is that *sannyāsīs,* or renounced men, are inclined to meditate on the impersonal aspect of the Absolute Truth. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (12.5), *kleśo ’dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām*: “For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Lord, advancement is exceedingly painful.” But as soon as a *sannyāsī* takes to preaching the glories of Kṛṣṇa in every town and village, his life becomes a blissful sequence of beautiful spiritual realizations.

In the autumn season the sky returns to its natural blue color. The vanishing of the clouds is like the vanishing of troublesome duties in *brahmacārī* life. Just after summer comes the rainy season, when the animals sometimes become disturbed by the torrential storms and thus huddle together. But the autumn season signals the time for the animals to go to their respective areas and live more peacefully. This represents a householder’s becoming free from the harassment of family duties and being able to devote more of his time to spiritual responsibilities, which are the real goal of life both for himself and his family. The removal of the muddy layer on the earth is like the removal of the inconveniences of *vānaprastha* life, and the purification of the water is like the sanctification of *sannyāsa* life by one’s preaching the glories of Kṛṣṇa without sex desire.

**The clouds, having given up all they possessed, shone forth with purified effulgence, just like peaceful sages who have given up all material desires and are thus free of all sinful propensities.**

### Purport

When the clouds are filled with water, they are dark and cover the sun’s rays, just as the material mind of an impure man covers the soul shining within. But when the clouds pour down their rain, they become white and then brilliantly reflect the shining sun, just as a man who gives up all material desires and sinful propensities becomes purified and then brilliantly reflects his own soul and the Supreme Soul within.

**During this season the mountains sometimes released their pure water and sometimes did not, just as experts in transcendental science sometimes give the nectar of transcendental knowledge and sometimes do not.**

### Purport

The first part of this chapter described the rainy season, and the second part has been dealing with the autumn season, which begins when the rain stops. During the rainy season water always flows from the mountains, but during the autumn the water sometimes flows and sometimes does not. Similarly, great saintly teachers sometimes speak expansively on spiritual knowledge, and sometimes they are silent. The self-realized soul is closely in touch with the Supreme Soul, and according to His desires a competent spiritual scientist may or may not describe the Absolute Truth, depending on the specific circumstances.

नैवाविदन् क्षीयमाणं जलं गाधजलेचरा- ।  
यथायुरन्वहं क्षय्यं नरा मूढा- कुटुम्बिन- ॥ ३७ ॥

### Verse text

*naivāvidan kṣīyamāṇaṁ  
jalaṁ gādha-jale-carāḥ  
yathāyur anv-ahaṁ kṣayyaṁ  
narā mūḍhāḥ kuṭumbinaḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *eva* — indeed; *avidan* — appreciated; *kṣīyamāṇam* — diminishing; *jalam* — the water; *gādha*-*jale* — in shallow water; *carāḥ* — those who move; *yathā* — as; *āyuḥ* — their life span; *anu*-*aham* — every day; *kṣayyam* — diminishing; *narāḥ* — men; *mūḍhāḥ* — foolish; *kuṭumbinaḥ* — living with family members.

### Translation

**The fish swimming in the increasingly shallow water did not at all understand that the water was diminishing, just as foolish family men cannot see how the time they have left to live is diminishing with every passing day.**

### Purport

After the rainy season the water gradually goes down, but stupid fish do not understand this; thus they are often stranded on the lakeshores and riverbanks. Similarly, those infatuated with family life do not understand that the remainder of their life is constantly decreasing; thus they fail to perfect their Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are stranded in the cycle of birth and death.

### Verse text

*gādha-vāri-carās tāpam  
avindañ charad-arka-jam  
yathā daridraḥ kṛpaṇaḥ

### Synonyms

*gādha*-*vāri*-*carāḥ* — those who were moving in shallow water; *tāpam* — suffering; *avindan* — experienced; *śarat*-*arka*-*jam* — due to the sun in the autumn season; *yathā* — as; *daridraḥ* — a poor person; *kṛpaṇaḥ* — miserly; *kuṭumbī* — absorbed in family life; *avijita*-*indriyaḥ* — who has not controlled the senses.

### Translation

**Just as a miserly, poverty-stricken person overly absorbed in family life suffers because he cannot control his senses, the fish swimming in the shallow water had to suffer the heat of the autumn sun.**

### Purport

Although, as described in the previous verse, unintelligent fish are not aware of the diminishing water, one may think these fish are still happy according to the old proverb “Ignorance is bliss.” But even the ignorant fish are scorched by the autumn sun. Similarly, although an attached family man may consider his ignorance of spiritual life blissful, he is constantly disturbed by the problems of family life, and, indeed, his uncontrolled senses lead him into a situation of unrelieved anguish.

### Translation

### Purport

The word *ādiṣu* in this verse indicates the by-products of the body, such as children, home and wealth.

### Purport

One recites ordinary Vedic mantras for material promotion, mystic power and impersonal salvation. But when a sage is completely free of personal desire, he vibrates the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord exclusively.

*kedārebhyas tv apo ’gṛhṇan

### Synonyms

*kedārebhyaḥ* — from the flooded fields of rice paddy; *tu* — and; *apaḥ* — the water; *agṛhṇan* — took; *karṣakāḥ* — the farmers; *dṛḍha* — strong; *setubhiḥ* — with dikes; *yathā* — as; *prāṇaiḥ* — through the senses; *sravat* — flowing out; *jñānam* — consciousness; *tat* — of those senses; *nirodhena* — by the strict control; *yoginaḥ* — *yogīs.*.

### Translation

**In the same way that the practitioners of yoga bring their senses under strict control to check their consciousness from flowing out through the agitated senses, the farmers erected strong mud banks to keep the water within their rice fields from draining out.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “In autumn, farmers save the water within the fields by building strong walls so that the water contained within the field cannot run out. There is hardly any hope for new rainfall; therefore they want to save whatever is in the field. Similarly, a person who is actually advanced in self-realization protects his energy by controlling the senses. It is advised that after the age of fifty one should retire from family life and conserve the energy of the body for utilization in the advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless one is able to control the senses and engage them in the transcendental loving service of Mukunda, there is no possibility of salvation.”

The clear and starry autumn sky can also be compared to the pure heart of the devotee. The spiritual nature is always brilliant, clean and blissful, and this spiritual nature, called *vaikuṇṭha,* immediately satisfies all the desires of the soul. This is the secret of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

When He was manifest on earth, Lord Kṛṣṇa was surrounded by prominent members of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty such as Nanda, Upananda, Vasudeva and Akrūra.

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments, “On the arrival of the autumn season, all the cows, deer, birds and females in general become pregnant, because in that season generally all the husbands become impelled by sex desire. This is exactly like the transcendentalists who, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, are bestowed with the benediction of their destinations in life. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has instructed in his *Upadeśāmṛta* that one should perform devotional service with great enthusiasm, patience and conviction and should follow the rules and regulations, keep oneself clean from material contamination and stay in the association of devotees. By following these principles, one is sure to achieve the desired result of devotional service. For he who patiently follows the regulative principles of devotional service, the time will come when he will achieve the result, as the wives who reap results by becoming pregnant.”

### Purport

The word *āgrayaṇaiḥ* refers to a particular authorized Vedic sacrifice, and the word *indriyaiḥ* refers to folk ceremonies that have somewhat worldly objectives.

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments as follows: “During autumn, the fields become filled with ripened grains. At that time, the people become happy over the harvest and observe various ceremonies, such as Navanna, the offering of new grains to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The new grains are first offered to the Deities in various temples, and all are invited to take sweet rice made of these new grains. There are other religious ceremonies and methods of worship, particularly in Bengal, where the greatest of all such ceremonies is held, called Durgā-pūjā.”

### Translation

**The merchants, sages, kings and brahmacārī students, kept in by the rain, were at last free to go out and attain their desired objects, just as those who achieve perfection in this life can, when the proper time comes, leave the material body and attain their respective forms.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments, “In Vṛndāvana the autumn season was very beautiful then because of the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. The mercantile community, the royal order and great sages were free to move to achieve their desired benedictions. Similarly, the transcendentalists, when freed from the encagement of the material body, also achieved their desired goal. During the rainy season, the mercantile community cannot move from one place to another and so do not get their desired profit. Nor can the royal order go from one place to another to collect taxes from the people. As for saintly persons, who must travel to preach transcendental knowledge, they also are restrained by the rainy season. But during the autumn, all of them leave their confines. In the case of the transcendentalist, be he a *jñānī,* a *yogī* or a devotee, because of the material body he cannot actually enjoy spiritual achievement. But as soon as he gives up the body, or after death, the *jñānī* merges into the spiritual effulgence of the Supreme Lord, the *yogī* transfers himself to the various higher planets, and the devotee goes to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vṛndāvana or one of the Vaikuṇṭhas, and thus enjoys his eternal spiritual life.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Rainy Season and Autumn in Vṛndāvana.”*
