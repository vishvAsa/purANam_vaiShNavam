CHAPTER SEVENTY-SEVEN

This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa disposed of Śālva, the master of deception, and destroyed his airship Saubha.

Having been removed from the battlefield, Pradyumna was extremely ashamed, and He ordered His driver to take His chariot once again into the presence of Dyumān. As Pradyumna fought with Dyumān, other Yadu heroes like Gada, Sātyaki, and Sāmba began to create havoc among Śālva’s army. The battle continued in this way for twenty-seven days and nights.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā, He found it under siege. At once He ordered Dāruka to drive Him onto the battlefield. Suddenly Śālva noticed the Lord and threw his spear at Kṛṣṇa’s charioteer, but the Lord shattered the weapon into hundreds of pieces and pierced Śālva and his Saubha vehicle with numerous arrows. Śālva responded by shooting an arrow that struck Kṛṣṇa’s left arm. Amazingly, the Lord dropped the Śārṅga bow He was holding in His left hand. The demigods watching the battle cried out in alarm upon seeing the bow fall, while Śālva took the opportunity to insult Kṛṣṇa.

Lord Kṛṣṇa then struck Śālva with His club, but the demon, vomiting blood, disappeared. A moment later a man came before Lord Kṛṣṇa and, after offering Him obeisances, introduced himself as a messenger from Mother Devakī. The man informed the Lord that His father, Vasudeva, had been kidnapped by Śālva. Upon hearing this, Lord Kṛṣṇa seemed to lament like an ordinary man. Śālva then led forward someone who looked just like Vasudeva, decapitated him and took the head with him into his Saubha airship. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, however, could understand the magic tricks of Śālva. Thus He pierced Śālva with a shower of arrows and struck the Saubha vehicle with His club, demolishing it. Śālva descended from his airplane and rushed toward Lord Kṛṣṇa to attack Him, but the Lord took up His Sudarśana disc and severed Śālva’s head from his body.

With the killing of Śālva, the demigods in the sky played kettledrums in jubilation. The demon Dantavakra then took a vow to avenge his friend Śālva’s death.

### Purport

If someone thinks that Lord Kṛṣṇa was actually bewildered by Śālva’s magic and that the Lord was subjected to ordinary mundane lamentation, such an opinion is illogical and contradictory, since it is well known that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, transcendental and absolute. This will be further explained in the following verses.

क्व‍ शोकमोहौ स्‍नेहो वा भयं वा येऽज्ञसम्भवा- ।

*kva śoka-mohau sneho vā  
bhayaṁ vā ye ’jña-sambhavāḥ  
kva cākhaṇḍita-vijñāna-  
jñānaiśvaryas tv akhaṇḍitaḥ*

### Synonyms

*kva* — where; *śoka* — lamentation; *mohau* — and bewilderment; *snehaḥ* — material affection; *vā* — or; *bhayam* — fear; *vā* — or; *ye* — those which; *ajñā* — out of ignorance; *sambhavāḥ* — born; *kva* *ca* — and where, on the other hand; *akhaṇḍita* — infinite; *vijñāna* — whose perception; *jñāna* — knowledge; *aiśvaryaḥ* — and power; *tu* — but; *akhaṇḍitaḥ* — the infinite Supreme Lord.

### Translation

**How can lamentation, bewilderment, material affection or fear, all born out of ignorance, be ascribed to the infinite Supreme Lord, whose perception, knowledge and power are all similarly infinite?**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “Lamentation, aggrievement and bewilderment are characteristics of conditioned souls, but how can such things affect the person of the Supreme, who is full of knowledge, power and all opulence? Actually, it is not at all possible that Lord Kṛṣṇa was misled by the mystic jugglery of Śālva. He was displaying His pastime of playing the role of a human being.”

All the great *Bhāgavatam* commentators conclude that grief, illusion, attachment and fear, which arise out of ignorance of the soul, can never be present in the transcendental dramatic pastimes enacted by the Lord. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives many examples from Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes to illustrate this point. For instance, when the cowherd boys entered the mouth of Aghāsura, Lord Kṛṣṇa was apparently astonished. Similarly, when Brahmā took away Lord Kṛṣṇa’s cowherd boyfriends and calves, the Lord at first began to look for them as if He did not know where they were. Thus the Lord plays the part of an ordinary human being so as to relish transcendental pastimes with His devotees. One should never think the Personality of Godhead is an ordinary person, as Śukadeva Gosvāmī explains in this and the following verse.

hinvanty anādyātma-viparyaya-graham  
labhanta ātmīyam anantam aiśvaraṁ  
kuto nu mohaḥ paramasya sad-gateḥ*

### Synonyms

*yat* — whose; *pāda* — of the feet; *sevā* — by service; *ūrjitayā* — made strong; *ātma*-*vidyayā* — by self-realization; *hinvanti* — they dispel; *anādi* — beginningless; *ātma* — of the self; *viparyaya*-*graham* — the misidentification; *labhante* — they attain; *ātmīyam* — in a personal relationship with Him; *anantam* — eternal; *aiśvaram* — glory; *kutaḥ* — how; *nu* — indeed; *mohaḥ* — bewilderment; *paramasya* — for the Supreme; *sat* — of saintly devotees; *gateḥ* — the destination.

### Translation

**By virtue of self-realization fortified by service rendered to His feet, devotees of the Lord dispel the bodily concept of life, which has bewildered the soul since time immemorial. Thus they attain eternal glory in His personal association. How, then, can that Supreme Truth, the destination of all genuine saints, be subject to illusion?**

### Purport

As a result of fasting the body becomes weak, and one thinks, “I am emaciated.” Similarly, sometimes a conditioned soul thinks, “I am happy” or “I am unhappy” — ideas based on the bodily concept of life. Simply by serving the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, devotees become free from this bodily concept of life. So how could such illusion possibly affect the Supreme Personality of Godhead at any time?

### Translation

**While Śālva continued to hurl torrents of weapons at Him with great force, Lord Kṛṣṇa, whose prowess never fails, shot His arrows at Śālva, wounding him and shattering his armor, bow and crest jewel. Then with His club the Lord smashed His enemy’s Saubha airship.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “Then Śālva thought that Kṛṣṇa had been bewildered by his mystic representations, he became encouraged and began to attack the Lord with greater strength and energy by showering volumes of arrows upon Him. But the enthusiasm of Śālva can be compared to the speedy march of flies into a fire. Lord Kṛṣṇa, by hurling His arrows with unfathomable strength, injured Śālva, whose armor, bow and jeweled helmet all scattered into pieces. With a crashing blow from Kṛṣṇa’s club, Śālva’s wonderful airplane burst into pieces and fell into the sea.”

The fact that Śālva’s insignificant mystic power could not bewilder Lord Kṛṣṇa is here emphatically demonstrated.
