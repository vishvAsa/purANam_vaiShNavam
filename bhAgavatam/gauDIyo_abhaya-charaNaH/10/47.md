CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN

This chapter describes how Uddhava, on the order of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, delivered the Lord’s message to the *gopīs,* consoled them and then returned to Mathurā.

When the young maidens of Vraja saw lotus-eyed Uddhava, who wore a yellow garment and attractive earrings, they were astonished at how much he resembled Kṛṣṇa. Thinking “Who is this?” they approached and encircled him. When they realized that Kṛṣṇa must have sent him, they brought him to a secluded place where he could speak to them confidentially.

The *gopīs* then began to remember the pastimes they had enjoyed with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and putting aside all ordinary propriety and shyness, they loudly wept. One *gopī,* while deeply meditating on Her association with Kṛṣṇa, noticed a bumblebee before Her. Imagining the bee to be a messenger from Him, She said, “Just as bees wander among various flowers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa has abandoned the young girls of Vraja and developed affection for other women.” The *gopī* continued to speak in this way, contrasting Her own supposed ill fortune to Her rival lovers’ good fortune, all the while glorifying the names, forms, qualities and pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. She then declared that although Kṛṣṇa may have abandoned the *gopīs,* they could not possibly stop remembering Him for even a moment.

Uddhava tried to console the damsels of Vraja, who were so anxious to see Kṛṣṇa once again. Uddhava explained, “While ordinary persons must perform many pious deeds to qualify as servants of Lord Kṛṣṇa, you simple cowherd girls are so extremely fortunate that the Lord has favored you with the very highest degree of pure devotion for Him.” Uddhava then related to them the Lord’s message.

Quoting Lord Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava said, “I am the Supreme Soul and supreme shelter of all. By My potencies I create, maintain and destroy the cosmos. I am indeed most dear to you *gopīs,* but to increase your attraction for Me and intensify your remembrance of Me, I left you. After all, when a woman’s beloved is far away, she fixes her mind upon him constantly. By incessantly remembering Me, you are sure to regain My association without delay.’”

The *gopīs* then asked Uddhava, “Is Kṛṣṇa happy now that Kaṁsa is dead and He can enjoy the company of His family members and the women of Mathurā? Does He still remember all the pastimes He enjoyed with us, such as the *rāsa* dance? Will Śrī Kṛṣṇa once again appear before us and give us ecstasy, just as Lord Indra, with his rain, gives life back to the forests aggrieved by the summer heat? Although we know that the greatest happiness comes from renunciation, we simply cannot stop hoping to attain Kṛṣṇa, for the marks of His lotus feet are still present throughout the land of Vraja, reminding us of His graceful gait, generous smiles and gentle talks. By all these our hearts have been stolen away.”

Having said this, the *gopīs* loudly chanted Lord Kṛṣṇa’s names, calling out, “O Govinda, please come and destroy our suffering!” Uddhava then pacified the *gopīs* with statements that dispelled their pain of separation, and they in turn worshiped him as nondifferent from Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Uddhava stayed in the district of Vraja for several months, giving pleasure to the residents by reminding them about Kṛṣṇa in various ways. Very satisfied at seeing the extent of the *gopīs’* love for the Lord, he declared, “These cowherd girls have perfected their lives by coming to the platform of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa. Indeed, even Lord Brahmā is inferior to them. The goddess of fortune herself, who always resides on Kṛṣṇa’s chest, could not get the same mercy as that which the *gopīs* obtained during the *rāsa* dance, when Kṛṣṇa embraced their necks with His mighty arms. What, then, to speak of other women! Indeed, I would consider myself most fortunate to take birth as even a bush or creeper that would sometimes be touched by the dust of these *gopīs’* lotus feet.”

Finally, Uddhava entreated Nanda Mahārāja and the other cowherd men for permission to go back to Mathurā. Nanda presented him with many gifts and prayed to Uddhava for the ability to always remember Kṛṣṇa. Returning to Mathurā, Uddhava offered Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa and King Ugrasena the gifts sent by Nanda Mahārāja and described to them everything he had experienced in Vraja.

He’s wearing Kṛṣṇa’s clothes and ornaments!” Saying this, the gopīs eagerly crowded around Uddhava, whose shelter was the lotus feet of Lord Uttamaḥśloka, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

The chaste *gopīs* were enlivened to see that a messenger had come from Kṛṣṇa. As Uddhava will discover during his stay in Vṛndāvana, the unique *gopīs* could not think of anything but their beloved Kṛṣṇa.

अन्येष्वर्थकृता मैत्री यावदर्थविडम्बनम् ।

### Verse text

*anyeṣv artha-kṛtā maitrī  
yāvad-artha-viḍambanam  
pumbhiḥ strīṣu kṛtā yadvat  
sumanaḥsv iva ṣaṭpadaiḥ*

### Synonyms

*anyeṣu* — toward others; *artha* — for some motivation; *kṛtā* — manifested; *maitrī* — friendship; *yāvat* — for as long; *artha* — (as one is fulfilling his) motive; *viḍambanam* — pretense; *pumbhiḥ* — by men; *strīṣu* — for women; *kṛtā* — shown; *yadvat* — as much; *sumanaḥsu* — for flowers; *iva* — as; *ṣaṭ*-*padaiḥ* — by bees.

### Translation

**The friendship shown toward others — those who are not family members — is motivated by personal interest, and thus it is a pretense that lasts only until one’s purpose is fulfilled. Such friendship is just like the interest men take in women, or bees in flowers.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains here that attractive women, like flowers, possess beauty, fragrance, tenderness, charm and so on. And as bees drink only once of a flower’s nectar and then leave it for another, fickle men abandon beautiful and devoted women to pursue other pleasures. This tendency is condemned here by the *gopīs,* who gave their hearts completely to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The *gopīs* wanted only to exhibit their charms for Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure, and in the pain of separation they questioned the motives of His friendship with them.

These are the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Both Lord Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs* are completely liberated souls engaged in spiritual loving affairs. By contrast, our so-called loving affairs, being perverted reflections of the perfect loving relationships in the spiritual world, are polluted with lust, greed, pride and so on. Like all liberated souls, the *gopīs* — and certainly Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself — are eternally free of these lower qualities, and their intense loving affairs are motivated exclusively by unalloyed devotion.

### Translation

**Thus speaking, the gopīs, whose words, bodies and minds were fully dedicated to Lord Govinda, put aside all their regular work now that Kṛṣṇa’s messenger, Śrī Uddhava, had arrived among them. Constantly remembering the activities their beloved Kṛṣṇa had performed in His childhood and youth, they sang about them and cried without shame.**

### Purport

The word *bālyayoḥ* here indicates that ever since their childhood, the *gopīs* had been completely in love with Kṛṣṇa. Thus even though social custom dictated that they not reveal their love to others, they forgot all external considerations and openly wept before Kṛṣṇa’s messenger, Uddhava.

### Translation

**One of the gopīs, while meditating on Her previous association with Kṛṣṇa, saw a honeybee before Her and imagined it to be a messenger sent by Her beloved. Thus She spoke as follows.**

### Purport

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is referred to in this verse as *kācit,* “a certain *gopī.*” To establish that this particular *gopī* is in fact Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī quotes the following verses from the *Agni Purāṇa:*

*gopyaḥ papracchur ūṣasi  
kṛṣṇānucaram uddhavam  
harī-līlā-vihārāṁś ca  
tatraikāṁ rādhikāṁ vinā*

*rādhā tad-bhāva-saṁlīnā  
vāsanāyā virāmitā  
sakhībhiḥ sābhyadhāc chuddha-  
vijñāna-guṇa-jṛmbhitam  
ijyānte-vāsināṁ veda  
caramāṁśa-vibhāvanaiḥ*

“At dawn the *gopīs* inquired from Kṛṣṇa’s servant, Uddhava, about the Lord’s pastimes and recreation. Only Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, immersed in thought of Kṛṣṇa, withdrew Her interest in the talks. Then Rādhā, who is worshiped by the residents of Her Vṛndāvana village, spoke up in the midst of Her girlfriends. Her words were full of pure transcendental knowledge and expressed the ultimate portion of the *Vedas.”*

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15) Lord Kṛṣṇa states, *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:* “By all the *Vedas,* I am to be known.” To know Kṛṣṇa is to love Kṛṣṇa, and thus Rādhārāṇī, by Her own example and words, revealed Her supreme love for the Lord.

Having quoted the above verses from the *Agni Purāṇa,* Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī also quotes the following from the *Nṛsiṁha-tāpanī Upaniṣad* (*Pūrva-khaṇḍa* 2.4): *yaṁ sarve devā namanti mumukṣavo brahma-vādinaś ca.* “All the demigods and all the transcendental philosophers who desire liberation bow down to the Supreme Lord.” We should follow suit.

### Translation

**The gopī said: O honeybee, O friend of a cheater, don’t touch My feet with your whiskers, which are smeared with the kuṅkuma that rubbed onto Kṛṣṇa’s garland when it was crushed by the breasts of a rival lover! Let Kṛṣṇa satisfy the women of Mathurā. One who sends a messenger like you will certainly be ridiculed in the Yadus’ assembly.**

### Purport

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī indirectly chastised Kṛṣṇa by chastising the bumblebee, which She took for His messenger. She addressed the bumblebee as *madhupa,* “one who drinks the nectar (of flowers),” and She addressed Kṛṣṇa as *madhu-pati,* “the Lord of Madhu.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that this and the following nine verses exemplify ten kinds of impulsive speech spoken by a lover. This verse illustrates the qualities of *prajalpa,* as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse from his *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.182):

*asūyerṣyā-mada-yujā  
yo ’vadhīraṇa-mudrayā  
priyasyākauśalodgāraḥ  
prajalpaḥ sa tu kīrtyate*

“*Prajalpa* is speech that denigrates the tactlessness of one’s lover with expressions of disrespect. It is spoken in a mood of envy, jealousy and pride.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word *kitava-bandho* expresses envy; the phrase from *sapatnyāḥ* to *naḥ,* jealousy; the phrase *mā spṛśa aṅghrim,* pride; and the phrase from *vahatu* to *prasādam,* disrespect, while the phrase from *yadu-sadasi* to the end of the verse decries Kṛṣṇa’s tactless treatment of Rādhārāṇī.

### Synonyms

*sakṛt* — once; *adhara* — of the lips; *sudhām* — the nectar; *svām* — His own; *mohinīm* — bewildering; *pāyayitvā* — making drink; *sumanasaḥ* — flowers; *iva* — like; *sadyaḥ* — suddenly; *tatyaje* — He abandoned; *asmān* — us; *bhavādṛk* — like you; *paricarati* — serves; *katham* — why; *tat* — His; *pāda*-*padmam* — lotus feet; *nu* — I wonder; *padmā* — Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune; *hi* *api* — indeed, because; *bata* — alas; *hṛta* — taken away; *cetāḥ* — her mind; *hi* — certainly; *uttamaḥ*-*śloka* — of Kṛṣṇa; *jalpaiḥ* — by the false speech.

### Translation

**After making us drink the enchanting nectar of His lips only once, Kṛṣṇa suddenly abandoned us, just as you might quickly abandon some flowers. How is it, then, that Goddess Padmā willingly serves His lotus feet? Alas! The answer must certainly be that her mind has been stolen away by His deceitful words.**

### Purport

In this verse Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī continues to compare Śrī Kṛṣṇa to the bumblebee, and in Her distress She states that the reason the goddess of fortune is constantly devoted to His lotus feet must be that she has been fooled by Kṛṣṇa’s promises. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this statement of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s illustrates *parijalpa,* as described in *Śrī Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.184):

*prabhor nidayatā-śāṭhya-  
cāpalyādy-upapādanāt  
sva-vicakṣaṇatā-vyaktir  
bhaṅgyā syāt parijalpitam*

“*Parijalpa* is that speech which, through various devices, shows one’s own cleverness by exposing the mercilessness, duplicity, unreliability and so on of one’s Lord.”

Better you sing about that friend of Arjuna in front of His new girlfriends, the burning desire in whose breasts He has now relieved. Those ladies will surely give you the charity you are begging.**

### Purport

With the words *agṛhāṇām agrato naḥ,* Rādhārāṇī laments that even though She and the other *gopīs* gave up their homes to love Kṛṣṇa in a conjugal relationship, the Lord left them and became a prince in the great royal city of the Yadus. Besides meaning “Arjuna, the victor,” the word *vijaya* also directly indicates Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is always victorious in His endeavors, and besides meaning “old (news),” the word *purāṇam* also indicates that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is glorified in the ancient Vedic scriptures of that name.

In this verse we observe in Rādhārāṇī’s mood the seed of jealous anger, which arises from an apparent disdain for Kṛṣṇa, accompanied by a sarcastic sidelong glance directed toward Him. Thus this verse fits the following description of *vijalpa* from the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.186):

*vyaktayāsūyayā gūḍha-  
māna-mudrāntarālayā  
agha-dviṣi kaṭākṣoktir  
vijalpo viduṣāṁ mataḥ*

“According to learned authorities, *vijalpa* is sarcastic speech that is addressed to the killer of Agha and that openly expresses jealousy while at the same time hinting at one’s angry pride.”

**In heaven, on earth or in the subterranean sphere, what women are unavailable to Him? He simply arches His eyebrows and smiles with deceptive charm, and they all become His.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that Rādhārāṇī’s speech, expressing all the feelings of a disappointed lover, indicates an intensity of love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa surpassing even that of the goddess of fortune. While all the *gopīs* are perfectly compatible with Śrī Kṛṣṇa in terms of their beauty, temperament and so on, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is especially so. In Her forlorn state, Rādhārāṇī indicates to Kṛṣṇa, “You are called Uttamaḥśloka because You are merciful to the wretched and fallen, but if You would be merciful to Me, then You would actually deserve this exalted name.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further points out that in this verse, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī expresses Her spite born of pride, accuses Kṛṣṇa of being a cheater and finds fault with His behavior. Thus this verse contains speech known as *ujjalpa,* as described in the following verse of the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.188):

*hareḥ kuhakatākhyānaṁ  
garva-garbhitayerṣyayā  
sāsūyaś ca tad-ākṣepo  
dhīrair ujjalpa īryate*

“The declaration of Lord Hari’s duplicitous nature in a mood of spite born of pride, together with jealously spoken insults directed against Him, has been termed *ujjalpa* by the wise.”

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this verse illustrates the qualities of *sañjalpa,* as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse of his *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.190):

*solluṇṭhayā gahanayā  
kayāpy ākṣepa-mudrayā  
tasyākṛta-jñatādy-uktiḥ  
sañjalpaḥ kathito budhaiḥ*

“The learned describe *sañjalpa* as that speech which decries with deep irony and insulting gestures the beloved’s ungratefulness and so on.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word *ādi,* “and so on,” implies the perception in one’s lover of hardheartedness, of an inimical attitude and of a complete lack of love.

**Like a hunter, He cruelly shot the king of the monkeys with arrows. Because He was conquered by a woman, He disfigured another woman who came to Him with lusty desires. And even after consuming the gifts of Bali Mahārāja, He bound him up with ropes as if he were a crow. So let us give up all friendship with this dark-complexioned boy, even if we can’t give up talking about Him.**

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda explains the meaning of this verse as follows: “\[Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī said to the bee,\] ‘You poor messenger, you are only a less intelligent servant. You do not know much about Kṛṣṇa — how ungrateful and hardhearted He has been, not only in this life but in His previous lives also. We have all heard this from our grandmother Paurṇamāsī. She has informed us that Kṛṣṇa was born in a *kṣatriya* family previous to this birth and was known as Rāmacandra. In that birth, instead of killing Vāli, an enemy of His friend, in the manner of a *kṣatriya,* He killed him just like a hunter. A hunter takes a secure hiding place and then kills an animal without facing it. So Lord Rāmacandra, as a *kṣatriya,* should have fought with Vāli face to face, but instigated by His friend, He killed him from behind a tree. Thus He deviated from the religious principles of a *kṣatriya.* Also, He was so attracted by the beauty of Sītā that He converted Śūrpaṇakhā, the sister of Rāvaṇa, into an ugly woman by cutting off her nose and ears. Śūrpaṇakhā proposed an intimate relationship with Him, and as a *kṣatriya* He should have satisfied her. But He was so henpecked that He could not forget Sītādevī and converted Śūrpaṇakhā into an ugly woman. Before that birth as a *kṣatriya,* He took birth as a *brāhmaṇa* boy known as Vāmanadeva and asked charity from Bali Mahārāja. Bali Mahārāja was so magnanimous that he gave Him whatever he had, yet Kṛṣṇa as Vāmanadeva ungratefully arrested him just like a crow and pushed him down to the Pātāla kingdom. We know all about Kṛṣṇa and how ungrateful He is. But here is the difficulty: in spite of His being so cruel and hardhearted, it is very difficult for us to give up talking about Him.’”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that this speech of Rādhārāṇī’s is called *avajalpa,* as described by Rūpa Gosvāmī in the following verse from the *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.192):

*harau kāṭhinya-kāmitva-  
dhaurtyād āsakty-ayogyatā  
yatra serṣyā-bhiyevoktā  
so ’vajalpaḥ satāṁ mataḥ*

“Saintly persons have concluded that when a lover, impelled by jealousy and fear, declares that Lord Hari is unworthy of her attachment because of His harshness, lustiness and dishonesty, such speech is called *avajalpa.*”

### Translation

**To hear about the pastimes that Kṛṣṇa regularly performs is nectar for the ears. For those who relish just a single drop of that nectar, even once, their dedication to material duality is ruined. Many such persons have suddenly given up their wretched homes and families and, themselves becoming wretched, traveled here to Vṛndāvana to wander about like birds, begging for their living.**

### Purport

Material duality is based on falsely thinking, “This is mine, and that is yours,” or “This is our country, and that is yours,” or “This is my family, and that is yours,” and so on. In fact, there is one Absolute Truth, in which we all exist and to whom everything belongs. His beauty and pleasure are also absolute and infinite, and if one actually hears about this Absolute Truth, called Kṛṣṇa, one’s dedication to the illusion of mundane duality is spoiled.

According to the *ācāryas,* and certainly in accord with Sanskrit grammar, the last two words of the second line of this text may also be divided *dharma-avinaṣṭāḥ.* Then the entire line becomes part of a single compound, the meaning of which is that hearing about Kṛṣṇa cleanses one of irreligious duality and thus one is not vanquished (*avinaṣṭa*) by material illusion. The word *dīnāḥ* is then given the alternate reading of *dhīrāḥ,* meaning that one becomes spiritually sober and thus gives up attachment to fleeting material relationships. The word *vihaṅgāḥ,* “birds,” would in this case refer to swans, the symbol of essential discrimination.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes Rūpa Gosvāmī as follows in connection with this verse:

*bhaṅgyā tyāgaucitī tasya  
khagānām api khedanāt  
yatra sānuśayaṁ proktā  
tad bhaved abhijalpitam*

“When a lover indirectly states with remorse that her beloved is fit to be given up, such speech, uttered like the plaintive crying of a bird, is called *abhijalpa.*” (*Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* 14.194)

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda explains the context of this verse: “While Rādhārāṇī was talking with the bee and the bee was flying hither and thither, it all of a sudden disappeared from Her sight. She was in full mourning due to separation from Kṛṣṇa and felt ecstasy by talking with the bee. But as soon as the bee disappeared, She became almost mad, thinking that the messenger-bee might have returned to Kṛṣṇa to inform Him all about Her talking against Him. ‘Kṛṣṇa must be very sorry to hear it,’ She thought. In this way She was overwhelmed by another type of ecstasy.

“In the meantime, the bee, flying hither and thither, appeared before Her again. She thought, ‘Kṛṣṇa is still kind to Me. In spite of the messenger’s carrying disruptive messages, He is so kind that He has again sent the bee to take Me to Him.’ Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī was very careful this time not to say anything against Kṛṣṇa.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the goddess of fortune, Śrī, has the power to assume many different forms. Thus when Kṛṣṇa enjoys other women, she stays on His chest in the form of a golden line. When He is not consorting with other women, she puts aside this form and gives Him pleasure in Her naturally beautiful form of a young woman.

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, this statement of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s expresses *pratijalpa,* as described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:

*dustyaja-dvandva-bhāve ’smin  
prāptir nārhety anuddhatam  
dūta-sammānanenoktaṁ  
yatra sa pratijalpakaḥ*

“When the lover humbly states that although she is unworthy of attaining her beloved she cannot give up hoping for a conjugal relationship with Him, such words, spoken with respect for her beloved’s message, are called *pratijalpa.*” (*Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* 14.198)

Here Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī has given up Her harsh feelings and humbly acknowledges the greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 6.68).

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī writes very poetically, with deep spiritual insight, about the emotions expressed in this and the previous nine verses. He interprets Rādhārāṇī’s feelings as follows:

Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī thought, “Since Kṛṣṇa was once satisfied in Vraja but left for Mathurā City, won’t He also develop a desire to leave that place and go somewhere else? Mathurā is so close to Vṛndāvana that it’s possible He may even come back here.

“Kṛṣṇa is the son of a respectable gentleman, Nanda Mahārāja, so He must be staying in Mathurā because of His sense of obligation to His father, who authorized His going there. On the other hand, while Nanda’s whole life is dedicated exclusively to Kṛṣṇa, Nanda is so innocent that he allowed himself to be tricked by the Yadus, who brought Kṛṣṇa to Mathurā. Kṛṣṇa must be thinking, ‘Alas, alas! Since even My father could not bring Me back to Vraja, what can I do to return there?’ Thus Kṛṣṇa must be impatient to come back here, and so He has sent you, a messenger.

“It is only because Nanda is so innocent that he allowed his son to leave. If Nanda had allowed Kṛṣṇa’s mother, the queen of Vraja, to do so, she would have climbed onto Akrūra’s chariot and, holding her son by the neck, gone off to Mathurā with Him, followed by all the *gopīs.* But this was not possible.

“Ever since Kṛṣṇa left, Nanda has been stunned by separation from Him, and Nanda’s treasury rooms, storehouses, kitchens, sleeping quarters, opulent houses and so on are now vacant. Unswept and uncleansed, they are littered with grass, dust, leaves and cobwebs. Does Kṛṣṇa ever remember His father’s houses? And does He sometimes remember Subala and His other friends, who are now lying stunned in other neglected houses?

“The women in Mathurā who now associate with Kṛṣṇa cannot know how to serve Him in the way that pleases Him most. When they see He is not satisfied and ask how they can make Him happy, does He tell them about us *gopīs?*

“Kṛṣṇa must tell them, ‘You city ladies cannot please Me as much as the *gopīs* of Vraja. They are most expert in stringing flower garlands, perfuming their bodies with ointments, playing various rhythms and melodies on stringed instruments, dancing and singing in the *rāsa* performance, displaying their beauty, charm and cleverness, and skillfully playing at questions and answers. They are especially expert in the pastimes of meeting one’s lover and showing jealous anger and other signs of pure love and affection.’ Surely Kṛṣṇa must know this. Therefore He’ll probably tell the women of Mathurā, ‘My dear women of the Yadu clan, please go back to your families. I no longer desire to associate with you. In fact, I’m going back to Vraja early tomorrow morning.’

“When will Kṛṣṇa speak like this and come back here to place His hand, fragrant with *aguru,* on our heads? Then He will console us, saying, ‘O beloveds of My heart, I swear to you that I will never abandon you again and go elsewhere. Indeed, I have not been able to find anyone in all the three worlds with even a trace of your good qualities.’”

Thus Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī interprets the feelings of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The *ācārya* further explains that the present text displays the speech called *sujalpa,* as described by Rūpa Gosvāmī:

*yatrārjavāt sa-gāmbhīryaṁ  
sa-dainyaṁ saha-cāpalam  
sotkaṇṭhaṁ ca hariḥ pṛṣṭaḥ  
sa sujalpo nigadyate*

“When, out of honest sincerity, a lover questions Śrī Hari with gravity, humility, unsteadiness and eagerness, such speech is known as *sujalpa.*” (*Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* 14.200)

Concluding this section of Chapter Forty-seven, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that there are ten divisions of divine madness (*divyonmāda*), which are expressed by the ten divisions of *citra-jalpa,* or variegated speech. Such divine madness is shown in the special pastime of bewilderment, which is itself part of the supreme bliss, *mahā-bhāva,* of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The *ācārya* quotes the following verses from Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi* (14.174, 178-80) to explain these ecstasies:

*prāyo vṛndāvaneśvaryāṁ  
mohano ’yam udañcati  
etasya mohanākhyasya  
gatiṁ kām apy upeyuṣaḥ*

*bhramābhā kāpi vaicitrī  
divyonmāda itīryate  
udghūrṇā citra-jalpādyās  
tad-bhedā bahavo matāḥ*

*preṣṭhasya suhṛd-āloke  
gūḍha-roṣābhijṛmbhitaḥ  
bhūri-bhāva-mayo jalpo  
yas tīvrotkaṇṭhitāntimaḥ*

*citra-jalpo daśāṅgo ’yaṁ  
prajalpaḥ parijalpitaḥ  
vijalpo ’jjalpa-sañjalpaḥ  
avajalpo ’bhijalpitam*

*ājalpaḥ pratijalpaś ca  
sujalpaś ceti kīrtitaḥ*

“It is virtually only within the princess of Vṛndāvana \[Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī\] that the ecstasy of bewilderment arises. She has attained to a special stage of this bewilderment, a wonderful state that resembles delusion. Known as *divyonmāda,* it has many aspects, which come and go unsteadily, and one of these manifestations is *citra-jalpa.* This talk, induced by Her seeing Her beloved’s friend, is filled with covered anger and comprises many different ecstasies. It culminates in Her intense, anxious eagerness.

“This *citra-jalpa* has ten divisions, known as *prajalpa,* *parijalpa,* *vijalpa,* *ujjalpa,* *sañjalpa,* *avajalpa,* *abhijalpa,* *ājalpa,* *pratijalpa* and *sujalpa.*”

Finally, some authorities say that Kṛṣṇa Himself, eager to drink the sweetness of His beloved’s speech, assumed the form of the messenger bee.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the *gopīs* gave up their sense of possessiveness toward these objects. History shows that the *gopīs* remained in Vṛndāvana, living in their houses with their families. However, unlike ordinary persons, they entirely renounced the egoistical sense of possession of sons, husbands and so on. They never tried to enjoy them but rather gave their whole heart and mind to the Supreme Lord, as recommended in the great religious scriptures of the world. Following the example of the *gopīs,* we should love the Supreme Lord with all of our heart, soul and might.

### Translation

**You have rightfully claimed the privilege of unalloyed love for the transcendental Lord, O most glorious gopīs. Indeed, by exhibiting your love for Kṛṣṇa in separation from Him, you have shown me great mercy.**

### Purport

The *gopīs* showed not only Uddhava but the whole world the joy of love of Godhead, and thus they bestowed their mercy on everyone. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, because their loving devotion was executed in an appropriate way, their love brought the Supreme Lord under their control. Still, to show the intensity of their love, He apparently left them. But now He again manifested Himself among them, becoming spiritually present through their intense devotion.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Lord said; *bhavatīnām* — of you women; *viyogaḥ* — separation; *me* — from Me; *na* — is not; *hi* — indeed; *sarva*-*ātmanā* — from the Soul of all existence; *kvacit* — ever; *yathā* — as; *bhūtāni* — the physical elements; *bhūteṣu* — in all created beings; *kham* — the ether; *vāyu*-*agniḥ* — air and fire; *jalam* — water; *mahī* — earth; *tathā* — so; *aham* — I; *ca* — and; *manaḥ* — of the mind; *prāṇa* — vital air; *bhūta* — material elements; *indriya* — bodily senses; *guṇa* — and of the primal modes of nature; *āśrayaḥ* — present as their shelter.

### Translation

**The Supreme Lord said: You are never actually separated from Me, for I am the Soul of all creation. Just as the elements of nature — ether, air, fire, water and earth — are present in every created thing, so I am present within everyone’s mind, life air and senses, and also within the physical elements and the modes of material nature.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the apparently philosophical language of the Lord’s statement conceals a deeper meaning. The Supreme Lord was secretly telling the *gopīs* that He, by way of reciprocating their special love for Him, was present with them, not only as the Soul of all creation but also as their special lover. In this sense of the verse, the word *guṇa* indicates the *gopīs’* special divine qualities, which attracted Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the word *sarvātmanā,* which we have here translated in reference to Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself (corresponding to the word *me,* which is also in the instrumental case), is also understood in the sense of *sarvathā,* or “completely.” In other words, although in one sense Lord Kṛṣṇa was absent, He could never be completely absent, since in His spiritual form He is always in the hearts and minds of the *gopīs.*

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead* and other books, Śrīla Prabhupāda has elaborately explained that the reason Lord Kṛṣṇa separated Himself from the *gopīs* was to intensify their love for Him and, as Uddhava noted, to bless other devotees by revealing to them the intensity of the *gopīs’* love. In fact, the Lord was spiritually present with the *gopīs,* since they are His eternal associates.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further points out that foolish persons will conclude that Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s use of philosophical language meant that the Lord was trying to bring the *gopīs* to the point of liberation by explaining basic points of Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy. In truth, the *gopīs* are the most exalted liberated souls, and their pastimes with Śrī Kṛṣṇa must be understood with the help of authorized *ācāryas.* When the *gopīs* came for the *rāsa* dance, Śrī Kṛṣṇa tried to preach *karma-yoga* to them, emphasizing ordinary ethics and morality, but the *gopīs* were beyond that. Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa now offers them *jñāna-yoga,* or metaphysical philosophy, but this is also inadequate for the *gopīs,* who have achieved spontaneous, unalloyed love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**By Myself I create, sustain and withdraw Myself within Myself by the power of My personal energy, which comprises the material elements, the senses and the modes of nature.**

### Purport

Although the Lord is the supreme entity, there is no absolute duality between Him and His creation, since the creation is an extension of His being. This oneness is here emphasized by the Lord.

*ātmā jñāna-mayaḥ śuddho  
vyatirikto ’guṇānvayaḥ  
suṣupti-svapna-jāgradbhir  
māyā-vṛttibhir īyate*

### Synonyms

*ātmā* — the soul; *jñāna*-*mayaḥ* — comprising transcendental knowledge; *śuddhaḥ* — pure; *vyatiriktaḥ* — separate; *aguṇa*-*anvayaḥ* — uninvolved in the reactions of the material modes; *suṣupti* — in deep sleep; *svapna* — ordinary sleep; *jāgradbhiḥ* — and waking consciousness; *māyā* — of the material energy; *vṛttibhiḥ* — by the functions; *īyate* — is perceived.

### Translation

**Being composed of pure consciousness, or knowledge, the soul is distinct from everything material and is uninvolved in the entanglements of the modes of nature. We can perceive the soul through the three functions of material nature known as wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep.**

### Purport

It is clearly stated here that the soul, *ātmā,* is constituted of pure knowledge, pure consciousness, and is thus ontologically distinct from the material nature. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word *ātmā* may also be taken to mean “the Supreme Soul, Lord Kṛṣṇa.” Since the Lord has just explained in the previous verses that all material phenomena are expansions of Himself, the phrase *māyā-vṛttibhir īyate* indicates that by studying this world deeply we will come to the perception of God. From this point of view also, the *gopīs* were advised not to lament.

*yenendriyārthān dhyāyeta  
mṛṣā svapna-vad utthitaḥ  
tan nirundhyād indriyāṇi  
vinidraḥ pratyapadyata*

### Synonyms

*yena* — by which (mind); *indriya* — of the senses; *arthān* — upon the objects; *dhyāyeta* — one meditates; *mṛṣā* — false; *svapna*-*vat* — like a dream; *utthitaḥ* — arisen from sleep; *tat* — that (mind); *nirundhyāt* — one should bring under control; *indriyāṇi* — the senses; *vinidraḥ* — not sleeping (alert); *pratyapadyata* — they obtain.

### Translation

**As a person just arisen from sleep may continue to meditate on a dream even though it is illusory, so by the agency of the mind one meditates on the sense objects, which the senses can then obtain. Therefore one should become fully alert and bring the mind under control.**

### Purport

The verb *pratipad* means “to be perceived or restored.” The soul that is *vinidra,* free from the dreamlike condition of material consciousness, is restored to its constitutional position as an eternal servitor of the Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus the soul is directly perceived by pure consciousness.

*etad-antaḥ samāmnāyo  
yogaḥ sāṅkhyaṁ manīṣiṇām  
tyāgas tapo damaḥ satyaṁ

### Synonyms

*etat* — having this; *antaḥ* — as its conclusion; *samāmnāyaḥ* — the entire Vedic literature; *yogaḥ* — the standard system of *yoga*; *sāṅkhyam* — the process of Sāṅkhya meditation, by which one learns to discriminate between spirit and matter; *manīṣiṇām* — of the intelligent; *tyāgaḥ* — renunciation; *tapaḥ* — austerity; *damaḥ* — sense control; *satyam* — and honesty; *samudra*-*antāḥ* — leading to the ocean; *iva* — as; *āpa*-*gāḥ* — rivers.

### Translation

**According to intelligent authorities, this is the ultimate conclusion of all the Vedas, as well as all practice of yoga, Sāṅkhya, renunciation, austerity, sense control and truthfulness, just as the sea is the ultimate destination of all rivers.**

### Purport

Here the Lord states that all Vedic literature is meant ultimately to bring the soul to the point of controlling the mind and senses and fixing them in transcendental self-realization. Thus processes of so-called *yoga,* mysticism or religion that involve unrestricted sense gratification are not actually spiritual processes but rather convenient ways for foolish people to justify their beastly behavior.

Lord Kṛṣṇa here assures the *gopīs* that by fixing their minds in self-realization, they will realize their spiritual oneness with the Lord. Thus they will no longer suffer the pangs of separation.

### Translation

**But the actual reason why I, the beloved object of your sight, have stayed far away from you is that I wanted to intensify your meditation upon Me and thus draw your minds closer to Me.**

### Purport

Sometimes that which is close to our eyes is far from our heart and mind, and conversely absence makes the heart grow fonder. Although apparently going far away from the *gopīs,* Lord Kṛṣṇa was bringing them closer to Him on the spiritual platform.

*kaccit* — perhaps; *gada*-*agrajaḥ* — Kṛṣṇa, the elder brother of Gada; *saumya* — O gentle (Uddhava); *karoti* — is giving; *pura* — of the city; *yoṣitām* — for the women; *prītim* — loving happiness; *naḥ* — which belongs to us; *snigdha* — affectionate; *sa*-*vrīḍa* — and bashful; *hāsa* — with smiles; *udāra* — generous; *īkṣaṇa* — by their glances; *arcitaḥ* — worshiped.

### Translation

**Gentle Uddhava, is the elder brother of Gada now bestowing on the city women the pleasure that actually belongs to us? We suppose those ladies worship Him with generous glances full of affectionate, shy smiles.**

### Purport

The name Gadāgraja indicates Kṛṣṇa, the elder brother (*agraja*) of Gada, the first son of Devarakṣitā. She was a sister of Devakī’s who was also married to Vasudeva. The *gopīs,* by addressing Kṛṣṇa in this way, indicate that He now thinks of Himself mostly as the son of Devakī, the implication being that His connection with Vṛndāvana has now slackened. Because of intense love, the *gopīs* could not stop thinking of Kṛṣṇa for a moment.

### Translation

**O saintly one, does Govinda ever remember us during His conversations with the city women? Does He ever mention us village girls as He freely talks with them?**

### Purport

The *gopīs* were so completely in love with Kṛṣṇa, without selfish motive, that even in their great disappointment they never considered giving their love to another. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī interprets their feelings as follows.

The *gopīs* might say, “Surely Kṛṣṇa has abandoned us because we deserve to be abandoned. Indeed, we are the most insignificant women in the world and have been rejected after having been enjoyed. Still, do we sometimes enter into His memory on account of some good quality of ours, or even because of something we did wrong? Kṛṣṇa must speak very freely with the city women. He and they must sing, joke, make riddles and talk about so many things. Does Kṛṣṇa ever say, ‘My dear city women, your sophisticated singing and speech is unknown to the *gopīs* in My home village. They couldn’t understand these things.’ Does He ever speak about us even in that way?”

### Translation

**Does He recall those nights in the Vṛndāvana forest, lovely with lotus, jasmine and the bright moon? As we glorified His charming pastimes, He enjoyed with us, His beloved girlfriends, in the circle of the rāsa dance, which resounded with the music of ankle bells.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following deep realization about this verse: “The *gopīs* knew that no place could be as beautiful as Vṛndāvana. Nowhere else in the universe could one find such a charming scene as the Vṛndāvana forest, which was scented with pious flowers and illumined by the full moon’s light reflected from the serene waves of the sacred Yamunā River. No one loved Kṛṣṇa as much as the *gopīs,* and thus no one else could understand Him as well. The *gopīs* rendered intimate service to Kṛṣṇa that only they could perfect. Thus the *gopīs* were distraught to think that Lord Kṛṣṇa was bereft of Vṛndāvana and bereft of their service. Free of all material lust, they were overwhelmed with disappointment because they could not give Kṛṣṇa happiness by their loving service. They simply could not imagine Kṛṣṇa enjoying anywhere else as He did in Vṛndāvana in their company.”

### Purport

Although the *gopīs* lamented that Kṛṣṇa was associating with the city women in Mathurā, they now realize that as the absolute Personality of Godhead, He has no need for any women. It is out of His causeless mercy that He awards His association to His loving devotees.

### Translation

**O master, O master of the goddess of fortune, O master of Vraja! O destroyer of all suffering, Govinda, please lift Your Gokula out of the ocean of distress in which it is drowning!**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī presents the following insight into this scene: Someone might propose to the *gopīs,* “Why don’t you just go somewhere else? Leave Vṛndāvana, and then you won’t have to see these rivers, mountains and forests. Cover your eyes with your garments, use your intelligence to lead your minds to some other thought, and thus forget Kṛṣṇa.” The *gopīs* answer this suggestion in the previous verse by stating, “We no longer possess our intelligence, for Kṛṣṇa has taken it away by His supreme beauty and charm.”

Now in the present verse the feelings of the *gopīs* become so strong that they disregard Uddhava and, turning toward Mathurā, address Kṛṣṇa Himself with humble cries. They address Kṛṣṇa as Vrajanātha because in the past young Kṛṣṇa performed many inconceivable pastimes to protect His beloved village people, such as lifting Govardhana Hill and destroying many monstrous demons. In this heartrending verse, the *gopīs* cry out to Kṛṣṇa to remember the wonderful, sweet relationship they once enjoyed together as innocent village people. Indeed, Śrī Kṛṣṇa would lovingly take care of His father’s cows, and the *gopīs* appealed to Him to remember these duties and return so He could resume them.

Thus Uddhava himself enjoyed great transcendental bliss in their association.

### Translation

**Thus seeing how the gopīs were always disturbed because of their total absorption in Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava was supremely pleased. Desiring to offer them all respect, he sang as follows.**

### Purport

*Viklava,* “mental disturbance,” should not be confused here with ordinary material distress. It is clearly stated that Uddhava was supremely pleased, and he felt this way because he saw that the *gopīs* had attained the highest state of loving ecstasy. Uddhava was an exalted member of the court in Dvārakā, an important minister in world political affairs, and yet he felt the spiritual urge to offer his obeisances to the glorious *gopīs,* although externally they were mere cowherd girls in an insignificant village called Vṛndāvana. Thus, to explain his feelings he sang the following verses. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states that Uddhava sang these verses daily while he was in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**\[Uddhava sang:\] Among all persons on earth, these cowherd women alone have actually perfected their embodied lives, for they have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Lord Govinda. Their pure love is hankered after by those who fear material existence, by great sages, and by ourselves as well. For one who has tasted the narrations of the infinite Lord, what is the use of taking birth as a high-class brāhmaṇa, or even as Lord Brahmā himself?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that here the term *brahma-janmabhiḥ,* “brahminical births,” refers to the threefold birth by (1) seminal parenthood, (2) sacred-thread initiation and (3) sacrificial initiation. These cannot compare to pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**How amazing it is that these simple women who wander about the forest, seemingly spoiled by improper behavior, have achieved the perfection of unalloyed love for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul! Still, it is true that the Supreme Lord Himself awards His blessings even to an ignorant worshiper, just as the best medicine works even when taken by a person ignorant of its ingredients.**

### Purport

The use of the word *kva* in the first two lines indicates a sharp contrast between apparently incompatible items, in this case the apparently insignificant and even impure position of the *gopīs,* mentioned in the first line, and their attainment of the highest perfection of life, mentioned in the second. In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes three types of adulterous women. The first is a woman who enjoys both her husband and a lover, being faithful to neither. Both ordinary society and the scriptures condemn this conduct. The second type of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband to enjoy only with her lover. Society and the scriptures also condemn this behavior, although such a fallen woman may be said to at least have the good quality of dedicating herself to a single man. The last kind of adulterous woman is she who abandons her husband and enjoys in the attitude of being a lover of the Supreme Lord alone. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that although foolish, common people criticize this position, such behavior is commended by those who are wise in spiritual science. Therefore learned members of society and the revealed scriptures praise such single-minded devotion to the Lord. Such was the *gopīs’* behavior. Thus the term *vyabhicāra-duṣṭāḥ,* “corrupted by deviation,” indicates the apparent resemblance between the *gopīs’* behavior and that of ordinary adulterous women.

### Translation

**When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was dancing with the gopīs in the rāsa-līlā, the gopīs were embraced by the arms of the Lord. This transcendental favor was never bestowed upon the goddess of fortune or other consorts in the spiritual world. Indeed, never was such a thing even imagined by the most beautiful girls in the heavenly planets, whose bodily luster and aroma resemble the lotus flower. And what to speak of worldly women who are very beautiful according to material estimation?**

### Purport

The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 8.80).

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows: Lord Kṛṣṇa, the best of all *avatāras,* exists on the highest platform of purity and morality, and thus He always remained praiseworthy by all, even while accepting worldly criticism for His cow-tending, wandering in the forest, taking meals with young monkeys, stealing yogurt, seducing other men’s wives, and so on. Similarly, the *gopīs,* who are constituted of the Lord’s pleasure potency, achieved the highest standard of purity and auspiciousness, even in comparison to the goddesses of fortune, and thus the *gopīs* are supremely glorious, even though they were criticized by worldly people because they were mere cowherd women living in the forest and behaving in an apparently improper way.

### Synonyms

*āsam* — of the *gopīs*; *aho* — oh; *caraṇa*-*reṇu* — the dust of the lotus feet; *juṣām* — devoted to; *aham* *syām* — let me become; *vṛndāvane* — in Vṛndāvana; *kim* *api* — any one; *gulma*-*latā*-*oṣadhīnām* — among bushes, creepers and herbs; *yā* — they who; *dustyajam* — very difficult to give up; *sva*-*janam* — family members; *ārya*-*patham* — the path of chastity; *ca* — and; *hitvā* — giving up; *bhejuḥ* — worshiped; *mukunda*-*padavīm* — the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa; *śrutibhiḥ* — by the *Vedas*; *vimṛgyām* — to be searched for.

### Translation

**The gopīs of Vṛndāvana have given up the association of their husbands, sons and other family members, who are very difficult to give up, and they have forsaken the path of chastity to take shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa, which one should search for by Vedic knowledge. Oh, let me be fortunate enough to be one of the bushes, creepers or herbs in Vṛndāvana, because the gopīs trample them and bless them with the dust of their lotus feet.**

### Purport

The word meanings and translation for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Antya* 7.47).

Śrī Uddhava here shows the perfect Vaiṣṇava attitude of humility. He does not pray to be equal to the *gopīs* in their exalted stage of love, but rather to take birth as a bush or creeper in Vṛndāvana so that when they walk upon him he will get the dust of their feet and thus be blessed. The shy *gopīs* would never agree to give such blessings to a great personality like Uddhava; therefore he cleverly sought to get such mercy by taking birth as a plant in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**The goddess of fortune herself, along with Lord Brahmā and all the other demigods, who are masters of yogic perfection, can worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa only within her mind. But during the rāsa dance Lord Kṛṣṇa placed His feet upon these gopīs’ breasts, and by embracing those feet the gopīs gave up all distress.**

### Purport

Śrī Uddhava, having established the glories of the *gopīs* in the previous verses, now directly offers his obeisances to them. According to the *Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī,* Śrī Uddhava did not offer such respect even to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens in Dvārakā.
