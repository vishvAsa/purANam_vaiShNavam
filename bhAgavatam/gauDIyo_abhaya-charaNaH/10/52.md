CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO

This chapter describes how Lord Balarāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa, running as if in fear, went to Dvārakā. Then Lord Kṛṣṇa heard the message of Rukmiṇī from the mouth of a *brāhmaṇa* and chose her as His wife.

King Mucukunda, shown mercy by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, offered obeisances and circumambulated Him. The King then left the cave and saw that humans, animals, trees and plants were all smaller than when he had fallen asleep. From this he could understand that the Age of Kali was at hand. Thus, in a mood of detachment from all material association, the King began worshiping the Supreme Lord, Śrī Hari.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa returned to Mathurā, which was still under siege by the barbarian army. He destroyed this army, collected all the valuables the soldiers had been carrying, and set off for Dvārakā. Just then Jarāsandha arrived on the scene with a force of twenty-three *akṣauhiṇīs.* Lord Balarāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa, acting as if fearful, left Their riches aside and ran far away. Because Jarāsandha could not appreciate Their true power, he ran after Them. After running a long way, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa came to a mountain named Pravarṣaṇa and proceeded to climb it. Jarāsandha thought They had hidden inside a cave and looked all over for Them. Unable to find Them, he built fires on all sides of the mountain. As the vegetation on the mountain slopes burst into flame, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma jumped off the peak. After reaching the ground unseen by Jarāsandha and his followers, They returned to the Dvārakā fort, which floated within the sea. Jarāsandha decided that Rāma and Kṛṣṇa had burned to death in the fire, and he took his army back to his kingdom.

At this point Mahārāja Parīkṣit asked a question, and Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī responded to it by beginning to narrate the history of the marriage of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī. Rukmiṇī, the young daughter of Bhīṣmaka, King of Vidarbha, had heard of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, strength and other fine qualities, and she therefore made up her mind that He would be the perfect husband for her. Lord Kṛṣṇa also wanted to marry her. But although Rukmiṇī’s other relatives approved of her marriage to Kṛṣṇa, her brother Rukmī was envious of the Lord and thus forbade her to marry Him. Rukmī wanted her to marry Śiśupāla instead. Rukmiṇī unhappily took up her duties in preparation for the marriage, but she also sent a trustworthy *brāhmaṇa* to Kṛṣṇa with a letter.

When the *brāhmaṇa* arrived in Dvārakā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa properly honored him with ritual worship and other tokens of reverence. The Lord then asked the *brāhmaṇa* why he had come. The *brāhmaṇa* opened Rukmiṇī’s letter and showed it to Lord Kṛṣṇa, who had the messenger read it to Him. Rukmiṇī-devī wrote: “Ever since I have heard about You, my Lord, I have become completely attracted to You. Without fail please come before my marriage to Śiśupāla and take me away. In accordance with family custom, on the day before my marriage I will visit the temple of goddess Ambikā. That would be the best opportunity for You to appear and easily kidnap me. If You do not show me this favor, I will give up my life by fasting and observing severe vows. Then perhaps in my next life I will be able to obtain You.”

After reading Rukmiṇī’s letter to Lord Kṛṣṇa, the *brāhmaṇa* took his leave so he might carry out his daily religious duties.

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*itthaṁ so ’nagrahīto ’nga  
kṛṣṇenekṣvāku nandanaḥ  
taṁ parikramya sannamya  
niścakrāma guhā-mukhāt*

संवीक्ष्य क्षुल्ल‍कान् मर्त्यान् पशून्वीरुद्वनस्पतीन् ।  
मत्वा कलियुगं प्राप्तं जगाम दिशमुत्तराम् ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*saṁvīkṣya kṣullakān martyān  
paśūn vīrud-vanaspatīn  
matvā kali-yugaṁ prāptaṁ  
jagāma diśam uttarām*

### Synonyms

*saṁvīkṣya* — noticing; *kṣullakān* — tiny; *martyān* — the human beings; *paśūn* — animals; *vīrut* — plants; *vanaspatīn* — and trees; *matvā* — considering; *kali*-*yugam* — the Age of Kali; *prāptam* — having arrived; *jagāma* — he went; *diśam* — to the direction; *uttarām* — northern.

### Translation

**Seeing that the size of all the human beings, animals, trees and plants was severely reduced, and thus realizing that the Age of Kali was at hand, Mucukunda left for the north.**

### Purport

There are several significant words in this verse. A standard Sanskrit dictionary gives the following English meanings for the word *kṣullaka:* “little, small, low, vile, poor, indigent, wicked, malicious, abandoned, hard, pained, distressed.” These are the symptoms of the Age of Kali, and all these qualities are said here to apply to men, animals, plants and trees in this age. We who are enamored of ourselves and our environment can perhaps imagine the superior beauty and living conditions available to people in former ages.

The last line of this text, *jagāma diśam uttarām* — “He went toward the north” — can be understood as follows. By traveling north in India, one comes to the world’s highest mountains, the Himālayan range. There one can still find many beautiful peaks and valleys, where there are quiet hermitages suitable for austerity and meditation. Thus in Vedic culture “going to the north” indicates renouncing the comforts of ordinary society and going to the Himālayan Mountains to practice serious austerities for spiritual advancement.

### Purport

Clearly we are observing one of the Supreme Lord’s transcendental pastimes. Although the *Bhāgavatam* states that the two Lords, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, were “exhausted,” even in Their so-called exhausted state They were able to quickly climb a high mountain and shortly thereafter jump off it to the ground. It would be unwise and illogical to ignore the whole picture the sages are giving us here and instead try to pick apart isolated descriptions. Clearly we are watching the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the midst of His spiritual pastimes; we are not observing an ordinary human being. Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma were still quite young men when this pastime took place, and one can easily see in these descriptions how They must have been enjoying Themselves, eagerly fleeing from the somewhat ridiculous King Jarāsandha, racing up a mountain, jumping off and totally befuddling the constantly failing demon, who somehow or other never lost confidence in himself. Seen without envy or quarrelsomeness, the Lord’s pastimes are immensely entertaining.

### Translation

**O hero among the Kurus, the Supreme Lord Himself, Govinda, married Bhīṣmaka’s daughter, Vaidarbhī, who was a direct expansion of the goddess of fortune. The Lord did this by her desire, and in the process He beat down Śālva and other kings who took Śiśupāla’s side. Indeed, as everyone watched, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took Rukmiṇī just as Garuḍa boldly stole nectar from the demigods.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives the following profound comments on these two verses: The words *śriyo mātrām* indicate that beautiful Rukmiṇī is a direct expansion of the eternal goddess of fortune. Therefore she is worthy to be the bride of the Personality of Godhead. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.56), *śriyaḥ kāntā kāntaḥ parama-puruṣaḥ:* “In the spiritual world, all the female lovers are goddesses of fortune and the male lover is the Supreme Personality.” Thus, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains, Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī-devī is a plenary portion of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. The *Kārttika-māhātmya* section of the *Padma Purāṇa* states, *kaiśore gopa-kanyās tā yauvane rāja-kanyakāḥ:* “In childhood, Śrī Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with the daughters of cowherd men, and in His adolescence He enjoyed with the daughters of kings.” Similarly, in the *Skanda Purāṇa* we find this statement: *rukmiṇī dvāravatyāṁ tu rādhā vṛndāvane vane.* “Rukmiṇī is in Dvārakā what Rādhā is in the forest of Vṛndāvana.”

The term *svayaṁvare* here means “by one’s own choice.” Although the word often refers to a formal Vedic ceremony in which an aristocratic girl may select her own husband, here it indicates the informal and indeed unprecedented events surrounding Kṛṣṇa’s marriage to Rukmiṇī. In fact, Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī chose each other because of their eternal, transcendental love.

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes the following *smṛti* statement: *rākṣaso yuddha-haraṇāt.* “A Rākṣasa marriage takes place when the bride is stolen from one’s rival suitors by force.” Similarly, Śukadeva Gosvāmī himself has already said, *rājñaḥ pramathya:* Kṛṣṇa had to beat down opposing kings to take Rukmiṇī.

### Translation

**My lord, I wish to hear how the immeasurably powerful Lord Kṛṣṇa took away His bride while defeating such kings as Māgadha and Sālva.**

### Purport

We should not think that Śrī Kṛṣṇa was actually afraid of Jarāsandha. In the very next chapter we will find that Śrī Kṛṣṇa easily defeats Jarāsandha and his soldiers. Thus we should never doubt the supreme prowess of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

King Bhīṣmaka was a pious man, and therefore many spiritually advanced persons must have visited his palace. Undoubtedly these saintly persons preached openly about the glories of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

Just as Lord Kṛṣṇa was described as *sadṛśaṁ patim,* an ideal husband for Rukmiṇī, being just like her, Rukmiṇī is described as *sadṛśīṁ bhāryām,* an ideal wife for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, being just like Him. That is natural, since Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī is Lord Kṛṣṇa’s internal potency.

### Translation

**\[The Supreme Lord said:\] O best of exalted brāhmaṇas, are your religious practices, sanctioned by senior authorities, proceeding without great difficulty? Is your mind always fully satisfied?**

### Purport

Here we have translated the word *dharma* as “religious practice,” although this does not fully convey the Sanskrit sense of the word. Kṛṣṇa did not appear within a secular society. The people in Vedic times could hardly imagine a society that did not understand the need to obey God’s law. Thus to them the word *dharma* conveyed a sense of duty in general, higher principles, prescribed duty and so on. It was automatically understood that such duties were within a religious context. But religion in those days was not a specific aspect or department of life, but rather a guiding light for all activities. Irreligious life was considered demoniac, and God’s hand was seen in everything.

### Translation

**I repeatedly bow My head in respect to those brāhmaṇas who are satisfied with their lot. Saintly, prideless and peaceful, they are the best well-wishers of all living beings.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that *sva-lābha* also means “achieving one’s self,” or, in other words, self-realization. Thus an advanced *brāhmaṇa* is always satisfied with his spiritual understanding, never depending on material formalities or facilities.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Thus questioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who incarnates to perform His pastimes, the brāhmaṇa told Him everything.**

### Purport

The word *gṛhīta* may be translated as “grasped or caught,” and thus, exactly as in English, may also mean “to perceive or understand something.” Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental body is perceived, understood, or in other words, grasped by the devotees when the Lord comes to exhibit His transcendental pastimes. These pastimes are not whimsical, but are a part of the complex program, structured and executed by the Lord Himself, for awakening the conditioned souls to their natural love and devotion for Him and bringing them back to Godhead.

The *ācāryas* comment as follows on this verse: “Rukmiṇī felt that no one could obtain Lord Kṛṣṇa by the efforts of a single lifetime. Therefore she earnestly pointed out the pious activities she had performed in that life and previous lives, hoping to convince Śrī Kṛṣṇa to come.”

### Purport

As Śrīla Prabhupāda points out in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Rukmiṇī, being born of royal blood, certainly had a brilliant grasp of political affairs. She advised Śrī Kṛṣṇa to enter the city alone and unnoticed and then surround Himself with His military commanders so He could do what was needed. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī compares the coming fight to the Lord’s churning of the ocean to extract the goddess Lakṣmī. Gorgeous Rukmiṇī, the goddess of fortune, would be gained in the coming turbulence.

tvām udvahe katham iti pravadāmy upāyam  
pūrve-dyur asti mahatī kula-deva-yātrā  
yasyāṁ bahir nava-vadhūr girijām upeyāt*

### Synonyms

*antaḥ*-*pura* — the women’s quarters of the palace; *antara* — within; *carīm* — moving; *anihatya* — without killing; *bandhūn* — your relatives; *tvām* — you; *udvahe* — I shall carry away; *katham* — how; *iti* — saying such words; *pravadāmi* — I shall explain; *upāyam* — a means; *pūrve*-*dyuḥ* — on the day before; *asti* — there is; *mahatī* — large; *kula* — of the royal family; *deva* — for the presiding deity; *yātrā* — a ceremonial procession; *yasyām* — in which; *bahiḥ* — outside; *nava* — new; *vadhūḥ* — the bride; *girijām* — goddess Girijā (Ambikā); *upeyāt* — approaches.

### Translation

**Since I will be staying within the inner chambers of the palace, You may wonder, “How can I carry you away without killing some of your relatives?” But I shall tell You a way: On the day before the marriage there is a grand procession to honor the royal family’s deity, and in this procession the new bride goes outside the city to visit Goddess Girijā.**

### Purport

Clever Rukmiṇī anticipated a possible objection on the part of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He certainly would not object to subduing rascals like Śiśupāla and Jarāsandha, but He might be reluctant to injure or kill Rukmiṇī’s relatives, some of whom might block His way to the palace’s inner sanctum, where the women were protected. The procession to or from the temple of Girijā (Durgā) would provide the perfect opportunity for Kṛṣṇa to kidnap Rukmiṇī without harming her relatives.

Then, after hundreds of lifetimes of endeavor, I may obtain Your mercy.**

The divine Rukmiṇī’s extraordinary dedication to Śrī Kṛṣṇa is possible only on the spiritual platform, not in the fragile world of mundane affection.

brāhmaṇa uvāca  
*ity ete guhya-sandeśā  
yadu-deva mayāhṛtāḥ  
vimṛśya kartuṁ yac cātra  
kriyatāṁ tad anantaram*

### Synonyms

*brāhmaṇaḥ* *uvāca* — the *brāhmaṇa* said; *iti* — thus; *ete* — these; *guhya* — confidential; *sandeśāḥ* — messages; *yadu*-*deva* — O Lord of the Yadus; *mayā* — by me; *āhṛtāḥ* — brought; *vimṛśya* — considering; *kartum* — to be done; *yat* — what; *ca* — and; *atra* — in this matter; *kriyatām* — please do; *tat* — that; *anantaram* — immediately following.

### Translation

**The brāhmaṇa said: This is the confidential message I have brought with me, O Lord of the Yadus. Please consider what must be done in these circumstances, and do it at once.**

### Purport

When the *brāhmaṇa* arrived, he broke the seal of a confidential letter written in the privacy of Rukmiṇī’s quarters and meant only for Lord Kṛṣṇa. By using the term *guhya-sandeśāḥ,* the trustworthy *brāhmaṇa,* personally selected by Rukmiṇī, here affirms that he has not violated the confidentiality of this message. Only Lord Kṛṣṇa has heard it. Since the marriage of Rukmiṇī was fast approaching, Śrī Kṛṣṇa would have to act immediately. The term *yadu-deva* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa, as the Lord of the powerful Yadu dynasty, should make His decision and then mobilize His followers if necessary.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Fifty-second Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Rukmiṇī’s Message to Lord Kṛṣṇa.”*
