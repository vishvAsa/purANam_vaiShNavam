CHAPTER SIX

A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when Nanda Mahārāja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death.

While Nanda Mahārāja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva’s words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Hari. Meanwhile, Kaṁsa sent to the village of Gokula a Rākṣasī named Pūtanā, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is the danger of such Rākṣasīs, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Pūtanā could expect nothing there but her own death.

One day, Pūtanā arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of Nanda Mahārāja, and by displaying her mystic power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered Kṛṣṇa’s bedroom without anyone’s permission; by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room, because that was Kṛṣṇa’s desire. The baby Kṛṣṇa, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Pūtanā and thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of Yoga-māyā and the Personality of Godhead, Pūtanā took Kṛṣṇa upon her lap, and neither Rohiṇī nor Yaśodā objected. The demon Pūtanā offered her breast for Kṛṣṇa to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child Kṛṣṇa, therefore, squeezed Pūtanā’s breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the ground. Then Kṛṣṇa began playing on her breast just like a small child. When Kṛṣṇa was playing, the *gopīs* were pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the *gopīs* took precautions because of the attack of the Rākṣasī. Mother Yaśodā gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed.

Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from Mathurā, and when they saw the great dead body of Pūtanā, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold this mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Pūtanā into pieces, but because Kṛṣṇa had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance. Ultimately, although Pūtanā had desired to kill Kṛṣṇa, she attained the Lord’s abode. From this incident we gain the instruction that if one is attached to Kṛṣṇa somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success. What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to Kṛṣṇa in love? When the inhabitants of Vraja heard about the killing of Pūtanā and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda Mahārāja took the baby Kṛṣṇa on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.

श्रीशुक उवाच  
नन्द- पथि वच- शौरेर्न मृषेति विचिन्तयन् ।  
हरिं जगाम शरणमुत्पातागमशङ्कित- ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*nandaḥ pathi vacaḥ śaurer  
na mṛṣeti vicintayan  
hariṁ jagāma śaraṇam  
utpātāgama-śaṅkitaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *nandaḥ* — Nanda Mahārāja; *pathi* — on his way back home; *vacaḥ* — the words; *śaureḥ* — of Vasudeva; *na* — not; *mṛṣā* — without purpose or cause; *iti* — thus; *vicintayan* — while thinking about inauspiciousness for his little son, Kṛṣṇa; *harim* — unto the Supreme Lord, the controller; *jagāma* — took; *śaraṇam* — shelter; *utpāta* — of disturbances; *āgama* — with the expectation; *śaṅkitaḥ* — thus being afraid.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: My dear King, while Nanda Mahārāja was on the way home, he considered that what Vasudeva had said could not be false or useless. There must have been some danger of disturbances in Gokula. As Nanda Mahārāja thought about the danger for his beautiful son, Kṛṣṇa, he was afraid, and he took shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme controller.**

### Purport

Whenever there is danger, the pure devotee thinks of the protection and shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also advised in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.33): *anityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām.* In this material world there is danger at every step (*padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām*). Therefore a devotee has no other recourse than to take shelter of the Lord at every step.

### Verse text

*na yatra śravaṇādīni

### Translation

**My dear King, wherever people in any position perform their occupational duties of devotional service by chanting and hearing \[śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ\], there cannot be any danger from bad elements. Therefore there was no need for anxiety about Gokula while the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present.**

### Purport

Śukadeva Gosvāmī spoke this verse to mitigate the anxiety of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore when he understood that Pūtanā was causing disturbances in Gokula, he was somewhat perturbed. Śukadeva Gosvāmī therefore assured him that there was no danger in Gokula. Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung: *nāmāśraya kari’ yatane tumi, thākaha āpana kāje.* Everyone is thus advised to seek shelter in the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and remain engaged in his own occupational duty. There is no loss in this, and the gain is tremendous. Even from a material point of view, everyone should take to chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* to be saved from all kinds of danger. This world is full of danger (*padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām*). Therefore we should be encouraged to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* so that in our family, society, neighborhood and nation, everything will be smooth and free from danger.

### Translation

**Once upon a time, Pūtanā Rākṣasī, who could move according to her desire and was wandering in outer space, converted herself by mystic power into a very beautiful woman and thus entered Gokula, the abode of Nanda Mahārāja.**

### Purport

Rākṣasīs learn mystic powers by which they can travel in outer space without machines. In some parts of India there are still such mystical witches, who can sit on a stick and use it to fly from one place to another in a very short time. This art was known to Pūtanā. Assuming the feature of a very beautiful woman, she entered Nanda Mahārāja’s abode, Gokula.

When the gopīs saw her, they thought that the beautiful goddess of fortune, holding a lotus flower in her hand, had come to see her husband, Kṛṣṇa.**

She could understand that this child was not ordinary, but was meant to kill all demons.**

### Purport

Demons are always busy creating disturbances and killing. But the child lying on the bed in the house of Nanda Mahārāja was meant to kill many demons.

### Synonyms

*vibudhya* — understanding; *tām* — her (Pūtanā); *bālaka*-*mārikā*-*graham* — a witch very expert in killing small babies; *cara*-*acara*-*ātmā* — Kṛṣṇa, the all-pervading Supersoul; *saḥ* — He; *nimīlita*-*īkṣaṇaḥ* — closed His eyes; *anantam* — the Unlimited; *āropayat* — she placed; *aṅkam* — on her lap; *antakam* — for her own annihilation; *yathā* — as; *uragam* — a snake; *suptam* — while sleeping; *abuddhi* — a person who has no intelligence; *rajju*-*dhīḥ* — one who thinks a snake to be a rope.

### Translation

**Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the all-pervading Supersoul, lying on the bed, understood that Pūtanā, a witch who was expert in killing small children, had come to kill Him. Therefore, as if afraid of her, Kṛṣṇa closed His eyes. Thus Pūtanā took upon her lap Him who was to be her own annihilation, just as an unintelligent person places a sleeping snake on his lap, thinking the snake to be a rope.**

### Purport

In this verse there are two perplexities. When Kṛṣṇa saw that Pūtanā had come to kill Him, He thought that since this woman was present with motherly affection, although artificial, He had to offer her a benediction. Therefore He looked at her with a little perplexity and then closed His eyes again. Pūtanā Rākṣasī also was perplexed. She was not intelligent enough to understand that she was taking a sleeping snake on her lap; she thought the snake to be an ordinary rope. The two words *antakam* and *anantam* are contradictory. Because of not being intelligent, Pūtanā thought that she could kill her *antakam,* the source of her annihilation; but because He is *ananta,* unlimited, no one can kill Him.

nirīkṣyamāṇe jananī hy atiṣṭhatām*

### Synonyms

*tām* — that (Pūtanā Rākṣasī); *tīkṣṇa*-*cittām* — having a very fierce heart for killing the child; *ati*-*vāma*-*ceṣṭitām* — although she was trying to treat the child better than a mother; *vīkṣya* *antarā* — seeing her within the room; *koṣa*-*paricchada*-*asi*-*vat* — like a sharp sword within a soft sheath; *vara*-*striyam* — the very beautiful woman; *tat*-*prabhayā* — by her influence; *ca* — also; *dharṣite* — being overwhelmed; *nirīkṣyamāṇe* — were seeing; *jananī* — the two mothers; *hi* — indeed; *atiṣṭhatām* — they remained silent, without prohibiting.

### Translation

**Pūtanā Rākṣasī’s heart was fierce and cruel, but she looked like a very affectionate mother. Thus she resembled a sharp sword in a soft sheath. Although seeing her within the room, Yaśodā and Rohiṇī, overwhelmed by her beauty, did not stop her, but remained silent because she treated the child like a mother.**

### Purport

Although Pūtanā was an outsider and although she personified fierce death because the determination within her heart was to kill the child, when she directly came and placed the child on her lap to offer the child her breast to suck, the mothers were so captivated by her beauty that they did not prohibit her. Sometimes a beautiful woman is dangerous because everyone, being captivated by external beauty (*māyā-mohita*), is unable to understand what is in her mind. Those who are captivated by the beauty of the external energy are called *māyā-mohita.* *Mohitaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam* (Bg. 7.13). *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 7.5.31). Here, of course, the two mothers Rohiṇī and Yaśodā were not *māyā-mohita,* deluded by the external energy, but to develop the pastimes of the Lord, they were captivated by Yoga-māyā. Such *māyā-moha* is the action of Yoga-māyā.

**On that very spot, the fiercely dangerous Rākṣasī took Kṛṣṇa on her lap and pushed her breast into His mouth. The nipple of her breast was smeared with a dangerous, immediately effective poison, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, becoming very angry at her, took hold of her breast, squeezed it very hard with both hands, and sucked out both the poison and her life.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa was not angry at Pūtanā for His own sake. Rather, He was angry because the Rākṣasī had killed so many small children in Vrajabhūmi. Therefore He decided that she should be punished by having to forfeit her life.

### Purport

Pūtanā was a great Rākṣasī who knew the art of covering her original form by mystic power, but when she was killed her mystic power could not hide her, and she appeared in her original form.

### Translation

**The Rākṣasī’s mouth was full of teeth, each resembling the front of a plow, her nostrils were deep like mountain caves, and her breasts resembled big slabs of stone fallen from a hill. Her scattered hair was the color of copper. The sockets of her eyes appeared like deep blind wells, her fearful thighs resembled the banks of a river, her arms, legs and feet seemed like big bridges, and her abdomen appeared like a dried-up lake. The hearts, ears and heads of the cowherd men and women were already shocked by the Rākṣasī’s screaming, and when they saw the fierce wonder of her body, they were even more frightened.**

*bālaṁ ca tasyā urasi  
krīḍantam akutobhayam  
gopyas tūrṇaṁ samabhyetya  
jagṛhur jāta-sambhramāḥ*

### Synonyms

*bālam* *ca* — the child also; *tasyāḥ* — of that (Rākṣasī Pūtanā); *urasi* — on the upper portion of the breast; *krīḍantam* — engaged in playing; *akutobhayam* — without fear; *gopyaḥ* — all the cowherd women; *tūrṇam* — immediately; *samabhyetya* — coming near; *jagṛhuḥ* — picked up; *jāta*-*sambhramāḥ* — with the same affection and respect they always maintained.

### Translation

**Without fear, the child Kṛṣṇa was playing on the upper portion of Pūtanā Rākṣasī’s breast, and when the gopīs saw the child’s wonderful activities, they immediately came forward with great jubilation and picked Him up.**

### Purport

Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead — Kṛṣṇa. Although the Rākṣasī Pūtanā could increase or decrease her bodily size by her mystic abilities and thus gain proportionate power, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equally powerful in any transcendental form. Kṛṣṇa is the real Personality of Godhead because whether as a child or as a grown-up young man, He is the same person. He does not need to become powerful by meditation or any other external endeavor. Therefore when the greatly powerful Pūtanā expanded her body, Kṛṣṇa remained the same small child and fearlessly played on the upper portion of her breast. *Ṣaḍaiśvarya-pūrṇa.* Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always full in all potencies, regardless of whether He is present in this form or that. His potencies are always full. *Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.* He can display all potencies under any circumstances.

### Synonyms

*yaśodā*-*rohiṇībhyām* — with mother Yaśodā and mother Rohiṇī, who principally took charge of the child; *tāḥ* — the other *gopīs*; *samam* — equally as important as Yaśodā and Rohiṇī; *bālasya* — of the child; *sarvataḥ* — from all dangers; *rakṣām* — protection; *vidadhire* — executed; *samyak* — completely; *go*-*puccha*-*bhramaṇa*-*ādibhiḥ* — by waving around the switch of a cow.

### Translation

**Thereafter, mother Yaśodā and Rohiṇī, along with the other elderly gopīs, waved about the switch of a cow to give full protection to the child Śrī Kṛṣṇa.**

### Purport

When Kṛṣṇa was saved from such a great danger, mother Yaśodā and Rohiṇī were principally concerned, and the other elderly *gopīs,* who were almost equally concerned, followed the activities of mother Yaśodā and Rohiṇī. Here we find that in household affairs, ladies could take charge of protecting a child simply by taking help from the cow. As described here, they knew how to wave about the switch of a cow so as to protect the child from all types of danger. There are so many facilities afforded by cow protection, but people have forgotten these arts. The importance of protecting cows is therefore stressed by Kṛṣṇa in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāvajam*). Even now in the Indian villages surrounding Vṛndāvana, the villagers live happily simply by giving protection to the cow. They keep cow dung very carefully and dry it to use as fuel. They keep a sufficient stock of grains, and because of giving protection to the cows, they have sufficient milk and milk products to solve all economic problems. Simply by giving protection to the cow, the villagers live so peacefully. Even the urine and stool of cows have medicinal value.

### Translation

**The child was thoroughly washed with cow urine and then smeared with the dust raised by the movements of the cows. Then different names of the Lord were applied with cow dung on twelve different parts of His body, beginning with the forehead, as done in applying tilaka. In this way, the child was given protection.**

### Translation

**The gopīs first executed the process of ācamana, drinking a sip of water from the right hand. They purified their bodies and hands with the nyāsa-mantra and then applied the same mantra upon the body of the child.**

### Purport

*Nyāsa-mantra* includes *ācamana,* or first drinking a sip of water kept in the right hand. There are different *viṣṇu-mantras* to purify the body. The *gopīs,* and in fact any householders, knew the process for being purified by chanting Vedic hymns. The *gopīs* executed this process first to purify themselves and then to purify the child Kṛṣṇa. One executes the process of *aṅga-nyāsa* and *kara-nyāsa* simply by drinking a little sip of water and chanting the *mantra.* The *mantra* is preceded with the first letter of the name, followed by *anusvāra* and the word *namaḥ:* *oṁ namo ’jas tavāṅghrī avyāt, maṁ mano maṇimāṁs tava jānunī avyāt,* and so on. By losing Indian culture, Indian householders have forgotten how to execute the *aṅga-nyāsa* and are simply busy in sense gratification, without any advanced knowledge of human civilization.

May Cakrī protect You from the front; may Śrī Hari, Gadādharī, the carrier of the club, protect You from the back; and may the carrier of the bow, who is known as the enemy of Madhu, and Lord Ajana, the carrier of the sword, protect Your two sides. May Lord Urugāya, the carrier of the conchshell, protect You from all corners; may Upendra protect You from above; may Garuḍa protect You on the ground; and may Lord Haladhara, the Supreme Person, protect You on all sides.**

### Purport

Even in the houses of the cultivators, who were not very advanced in the modern ways of civilization, the ladies used to know how to chant *mantras* to give protection to children with the help of cow dung and cow urine. This was a simple and practical way to give the greatest protection from the greatest dangers. People should know how to do this, for this is a part of Vedic civilization.

### Translation

**The evil witches known as Ḍākinīs, Yātudhānīs and Kuṣmāṇḍas are the greatest enemies of children, and the evil spirits like Bhūtas, Pretas, Piśācas, Yakṣas, Rākṣasas and Vināyakas, as well as witches like Koṭarā, Revatī, Jyeṣṭhā, Pūtanā and Mātṛkā, are always ready to give trouble to the body, the life air and the senses, causing loss of memory, madness and bad dreams. Like the most experienced evil stars, they all create great disturbances, especially for children, but one can vanquish them simply by uttering Lord Viṣṇu’s name, for when Lord Viṣṇu’s name resounds, all of them become afraid and go away.**

### Purport

As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33):

*advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam  
ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca  
vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person — nondual, infallible, and without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the *Vedas,* but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”

While decorating the body with *tilaka,* we give protection to the body by chanting twelve names of Viṣṇu. Although Govinda, or Lord Viṣṇu, is one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But if one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant, “Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu,” and always think of Lord Viṣṇu. *Viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param:* this is the highest form of worship. If one remembers Viṣṇu always, even though one is disturbed by many bad elements, one can be protected without a doubt. The *Āyurveda-śāstra* recommends, *auṣadhi cintayet viṣṇum:* even while taking medicine, one should remember Viṣṇu, because the medicine is not all and all and Lord Viṣṇu is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (*padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām*). Therefore one must become a Vaiṣṇava and think of Viṣṇu constantly. This is made easier by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam,* and *kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.*

### Translation

**Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: All the gopīs, headed by mother Yaśodā, were bound by maternal affection. After they thus chanted mantras to protect the child, mother Yaśodā gave the child the nipple of her breast to suck and then got Him to lie down on His bed.**

### Purport

When a baby drinks milk from the breast of his mother, this is a good sign of health. So the elderly *gopīs* were not satisfied with chanting *mantras* to give protection to Kṛṣṇa; they also tested whether their child’s health was in order. When the child sucked the breast, this confirmed that He was healthy, and when the *gopīs* were fully satisfied, they had the child lie down on His bed.

### Translation

**Meanwhile, all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Mahārāja, returned from Mathurā, and when they saw on the way the gigantic body of Pūtanā lying dead, they were struck with great wonder.**

### Purport

Nanda Mahārāja’s wonder may be understood in various ways. First of all, the cowherd men had never before seen such a gigantic body in Vṛndāvana, and therefore they were struck with wonder. Then they began to consider where such a body had come from, whether it had dropped from the sky, or whether, by some mistake or by the power of some mystic *yoginī,* they had come to some place other than Vṛndāvana. They could not actually guess what had happened, and therefore they were struck with wonder.

### Translation

**Nanda Mahārāja and the other gopas exclaimed: My dear friends, you must know that Ānakadundubhi, Vasudeva, has become a great saint or a master of mystic power. Otherwise how could he have foreseen this calamity and predicted it to us?**

### Purport

This verse illustrates the difference between *kṣatriyas* and innocent *vaiśyas.* By studying the political situation, Vasudeva could see what would happen, whereas Nanda Mahārāja, the king of the agriculturalists, could only guess that Vasudeva was a great saintly person and had developed mystic powers. Vasudeva actually had all mystic powers under his control; otherwise he could not have become the father of Kṛṣṇa. But in fact he foresaw the calamities in Vraja by studying Kaṁsa’s political activities and thus warned Nanda Mahārāja to take precautions, although Nanda Mahārāja thought that Vasudeva had predicted this incident through wonderful mystic powers. By mystic powers gained through the practice of *haṭha-yoga,* one can study and understand the future.

*kalevaraṁ paraśubhiś  
chittvā tat te vrajaukasaḥ  
dūre kṣiptvāvayavaśo  
nyadahan kāṣṭha-veṣṭitam*

### Synonyms

*kalevaram* — the gigantic body of Pūtanā; *paraśubhiḥ* — with the aid of axes; *chittvā* — after cutting to pieces; *tat* — that (body); *te* — all of those; *vraja*-*okasaḥ* — inhabitants of Vraja; *dūre* — far, far away; *kṣiptvā* — after throwing; *avayavaśaḥ* — different parts of the body, piece by piece; *nyadahan* — burned to ashes; *kāṣṭha*-*veṣṭitam* — covered by wood.

### Translation

**The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Pūtanā into pieces with the help of axes. Then they threw the pieces far away, covered them with wood and burned them to ashes.**

### Purport

It is the practice that after a snake has been killed, its body is cut into various pieces for fear that it may come to life again simply by interacting with air. Merely killing a serpent is not sufficient; after it is killed, it must be cut to pieces and burned, and then the danger will be over. Pūtanā resembled a great serpent, and therefore the cowherd men took the same precautions by burning her body to ashes.

### Verse text

*dahyamānasya dehasya  
dhūmaś cāguru-saurabhaḥ  
utthitaḥ kṛṣṇa-nirbhukta-  
sapady āhata-pāpmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*dahyamānasya* — while being burnt to ashes; *dehasya* — of the body of Pūtanā; *dhūmaḥ* — the smoke; *ca* — and; *aguru*-*saurabhaḥ* — turned into saintly scented smoke of the *aguru* herb; *utthitaḥ* — emanating from her body; *kṛṣṇa*-*nirbhukta* — because of Kṛṣṇa’s having sucked her breast; *sapadi* — immediately; *āhata*-*pāpmanaḥ* — her material body became spiritualized or relieved of all material conditions.

### Translation

**Because of Kṛṣṇa’s having sucked the breast of the Rākṣasī Pūtanā, when Kṛṣṇa killed her she was immediately freed of all material contamination. Her sinful reactions automatically vanished, and therefore when her gigantic body was being burnt, the smoke emanating from her body was fragrant like aguru incense.**

### Purport

Such are the effects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one somehow or other becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by applying his senses in the service of the Lord, one is immediately freed from material contamination. *Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 1.2.17). Hearing about the activities of Kṛṣṇa is the beginning of purified life. *Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ:* simply by hearing and chanting, one becomes purified. Therefore, in discharging devotional service, *śravaṇa-kīrtana* (hearing and chanting) is most important. Then, with purified senses, one begins to render service to the Lord (*hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam*). *Bhaktir ucyate:* this is called *bhakti.* When Pūtanā was somehow or other, directly or indirectly, induced to render some service to the Lord by feeding Him with her breast, she was immediately purified, so much so that when her nasty material body was burnt to ashes, it gave off the fragrance of *aguru,* the most agreeably scented herb.

### Synonyms

*pūtanā* — Pūtanā, the professional Rākṣasī; *loka*-*bāla*-*ghnī* — who used to kill human children; *rākṣasī* — the she-demon; *rudhira*-*aśanā* — simply hankering for blood; *jighāṁsayā* — with the desire to kill Kṛṣṇa (being envious of Kṛṣṇa and having been instructed by Kaṁsa); *api* — still; *haraye* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *stanam* — her breast; *dattvā* — after offering; *āpa* — obtained; *sat*-*gatim* — the most elevated position of spiritual existence; *kim* — what to speak of; *punaḥ* — again; *śraddhayā* — with faith; *bhaktyā* — by devotion; *kṛṣṇāya* — unto Lord Kṛṣṇa; *paramātmane* — who is the Supreme Person; *yacchan* — offering; *priya*-*tamam* — the dearmost; *kim* — something; *nu* — indeed; *raktāḥ* — those who have an affinity; *tat*-*mātaraḥ* — Kṛṣṇa’s affectionate mothers (offering the beloved child their breasts); *yathā* — exactly like.

### Translation

**Pūtanā was always hankering for the blood of human children, and with that desire she came to kill Kṛṣṇa; but because she offered her breast to the Lord, she attained the greatest achievement. What then is to be said of those who had natural devotion and affection for Kṛṣṇa as mothers and who offered Him their breasts to suck or offered something very dear, as a mother offers something to a child?**

### Purport

Pūtanā had no affection for Kṛṣṇa; rather, she was envious and wanted to kill Him. Nonetheless, because with or without knowledge she offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the offerings of devotees attracted to Kṛṣṇa in parental love are always sincere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection and love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative study. If Pūtanā could attain such an exalted position in spiritual life by neglectfully, enviously making an offering to Kṛṣṇa, what is to be said of mother Yaśodā and the other *gopīs,* who served Kṛṣṇa with such great affection and love, offering everything for Kṛṣṇa’s satisfaction? The *gopīs* automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended the affection of the *gopīs,* either in maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection in life (*ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā*).

### Synonyms

*padbhyām* — by the two lotus feet; *bhakta*-*hṛdi*-*sthābhyām* — which are always thought of by pure devotees, in whose heart the Lord is therefore situated constantly; *vandyābhyām* — which are always to be praised; *loka*-*vanditaiḥ* — by Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, who are praised by all the inhabitants of the three worlds; *aṅgam* — the body; *yasyāḥ* — of whom (Pūtanā); *samākramya* — embracing; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *api* — also; *tat*-*stanam* — that breast; *yātudhānī* *api* — although she was a witch (whose only business was to kill small children and who had tried to kill Kṛṣṇa also); *sā* — she; *svargam* — the transcendental abode; *avāpa* — achieved; *jananī*-*gatim* — the position of a mother; *kṛṣṇa*-*bhukta*-*stana*-*kṣīrāḥ* — therefore, because their breasts were sucked by Kṛṣṇa, who drank the milk flowing from their bodies; *kim* *u* — what to speak of; *gāvaḥ* — the cows; *anumātaraḥ* — exactly like mothers (who allowed their nipples to be sucked by Kṛṣṇa).

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is always situated within the core of the heart of the pure devotee, and He is always offered prayers by such worshipable personalities as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Because Kṛṣṇa embraced Pūtanā’s body with great pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she attained the position of a mother in the transcendental world and thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said of the cows whose nipples Kṛṣṇa sucked with great pleasure and who offered their milk very jubilantly with affection exactly like that of a mother?**

### Purport

These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, becomes successful. Pūtanā was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Kaṁsa to kill Kṛṣṇa. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the form of a very beautiful woman and approached Kṛṣṇa exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Yaśodā and Rohiṇī did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically promoted to a position like that of mother Yaśodā. As explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, there are various roles one may play in such a position. Pūtanā was immediately promoted to Vaikuṇṭhaloka, which is also sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the transcendental world. In Vaikuṇṭhaloka, Pūtanā attained the position of a nurse (*dhātry-ucitām*), as described by Uddhava. Pūtanā was elevated to the position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka Vṛndāvana to assist mother Yaśodā.

### Synonyms

*payāṁsi* — milk (coming from the body); *yāsām* — of all of whom; *apibat* — Lord Kṛṣṇa drank; *putra*-*sneha*-*snutāni* — that milk coming from the bodies of the *gopīs,* not artificially but because of maternal affection; *alam* — sufficiently; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *devakī*-*putraḥ* — who appeared as the son of Devakī; *kaivalya*-*ādi* — like liberation or merging into the Brahman effulgence; *akhila*-*pradaḥ* — the bestower of all similar blessings; *tāsām* — of all of them (of all the *gopīs*); *aviratam* — constantly; *kṛṣṇe* — unto Lord Kṛṣṇa; *kurvatīnām* — making; *suta*-*īkṣaṇam* — as a mother looks upon her child; *na* — never; *punaḥ* — again; *kalpate* — can be imagined; *rājan* — O King Parīkṣit; *saṁsāraḥ* — the material bondage of birth and death; *ajñāna*-*sambhavaḥ* — which is to be accepted by foolish persons ignorantly trying to become happy.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the bestower of many benedictions, including liberation \[kaivalya\], or oneness with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the gopīs always felt maternal love, and Kṛṣṇa sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and son, although the gopīs were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this material world after leaving their bodies.**

### Purport

The advantage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is described herein. Kṛṣṇa consciousness gradually develops on the transcendental platform. One may think of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme personality, one may think of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme master, one may think of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme friend, one may think of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme son, or one may think of Kṛṣṇa as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with Kṛṣṇa in any of these transcendental relationships, the course of one’s material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9), *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti:* for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. *Na punaḥ kalpate rājan saṁsāro jñāna-sambhavaḥ.* This verse also guarantees that devotees who constantly think of Kṛṣṇa in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world of *saṁsāra,* there are the same relationships. One thinks, “Here is my son,” “Here is my wife,” “Here is my lover,” or “Here is my friend.” But these relationships are temporary illusions. *Ajñāna-sambhavaḥ:* such a consciousness awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one’s spiritual life is revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the *gopīs* who were friends of Rohiṇī and mother Yaśodā and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by Kṛṣṇa were not directly Kṛṣṇa’s mothers, they all had the same chance as Rohiṇī and Yaśodā to go back to Godhead and act as Kṛṣṇa’s mothers-in-law, servants and so on. The word *saṁsāra* refers to attachment for one’s body, home, husband or wife, and children, but although the *gopīs* and all the other inhabitants of Vṛndāvana had the same affection and attachment for husband and home, their central affection was for Kṛṣṇa in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka Vṛndāvana in the next life, to live with Kṛṣṇa eternally in spiritual happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: *kṛṣṇera saṁsāra kara chāḍi’ anācāra.* One should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of Kṛṣṇa. Then one’s liberation is guaranteed.

Nanda Mahārāja, of course, was very much obliged to Vasudeva, who had foreseen the incident, and simply thanked him, thinking how wonderful Vasudeva was.**

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, best of the Kurus, Nanda Mahārāja was very liberal and simple. He immediately took his son Kṛṣṇa on his lap as if Kṛṣṇa had returned from death, and by formally smelling his son’s head, Nanda Mahārāja undoubtedly enjoyed transcendental bliss.**

### Purport

Nanda Mahārāja could not understand how the inhabitants of his house had allowed Pūtanā to enter the house, nor could he imagine the gravity of the situation. He did not understand that Kṛṣṇa had wanted to kill Pūtanā and that His pastimes were performed by Yoga-māyā. Nanda Mahārāja simply thought that someone had entered his house and created havoc. This was Nanda Mahārāja’s simplicity.

### Translation

**Any person who hears with faith and devotion about how Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Pūtanā, and who thus invests his hearing in such childhood pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, certainly attains attachment for Govinda, the supreme, original person.**

### Purport

The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but was killed herself is certainly wonderful. Therefore this verse uses the word *adbhutam,* meaning “specifically wonderful.” Kṛṣṇa has left us many wonderful narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in *Kṛṣṇa, The Supreme Personality of Godhead,* one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for Govinda, Ādi-puruṣa.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Killing of the Demon Pūtanā.”*
