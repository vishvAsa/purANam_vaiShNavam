CHAPTER SEVENTY-FOUR

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa received the honor of first worship during the Rājasūya sacrifice, and how He killed Śiśupāla.

After glorifying Lord Kṛṣṇa, King Yudhiṣṭhira selected qualified *brāhmaṇas* such as Bharadvāja, Gautama and Vasiṣṭha to serve as the priests of the Rājasūya sacrifice. Then many exalted guests of all the four social orders arrived to see the sacrificial performance.

As the sacrifice proceeded, the ritual of “first worship” had to be performed, and the members of the assembly were called upon to decide who would receive this honor. Sahadeva spoke up: “Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is indeed the most exalted person, for He Himself comprises all the deities worshiped by Vedic sacrifice. In His role as the Supersoul in the heart, He arranges for everyone in the universe to engage in his particular kind of work, and by His mercy alone human beings can perform various kinds of pious activities and receive the resultant benefits. One who worships Him worships all living entities. Surely Lord Kṛṣṇa should be worshiped first.”

Nearly everyone in the assembly agreed with Sahadeva’s proposal and loudly congratulated him. Thus King Yudhiṣṭhira happily worshiped Lord Kṛṣṇa. After bathing His feet, the King took the wash water and sprinkled it on his head, and his wives, younger brothers, ministers and relatives also sprinkled that water on their heads. Then everyone shouted, “All victory, all victory!” and bowed down to Lord Kṛṣṇa as flowers rained down from above.

Śiśupāla, however, could not tolerate this worship and glorification of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He stood up from his seat and harshly rebuked the wise elders for choosing Kṛṣṇa to be worshiped first. “After all” he said, “this Kṛṣṇa is outside the system of Vedic social and spiritual orders and the society of respectable families. He follows no principles of religion and has no good qualities.”

Even as Śiśupāla continued to blaspheme Him in this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained silent. But many members of the assembly covered their ears and quickly left the hall, while the Pāṇḍava brothers raised their weapons and prepared to kill Śiśupāla. Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped them from attacking, however, and instead used His Sudarśana disc to decapitate the offender. At that moment an effulgent spark of light rose out of Śiśupāla’s dead body and entered the transcendental body of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Having lived through three births as the enemy of the Lord, Śiśupāla now attained the liberation of *sāyujya,* merging into Him, by dint of his constant meditation on Him.

King Yudhiṣṭhira then distributed profuse gifts to the respected guests of the assembly and to the priests, and finally he executed the purificatory oblations known as the *prāyaścitta-homa,* which counteract errors made during the sacrifice. Yudhiṣṭhira’s Rājasūya sacrifice having now been completed, Lord Kṛṣṇa took His leave from the King and set off for Dvārakā in the company of His wives and ministers.

Duryodhana could not bear to see this abundant manifestation of King Yudhiṣṭhira’s prosperity, but apart from him, everyone happily praised the glories of the Rājasūya sacrifice and of the Lord of all sacrifices, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Actually, we are fit to be punished by You, but the wonder is that instead of punishing us, You so kindly and mercifully accept our orders and carry them out properly. Others are very surprised that Your Lordship can play the part of an ordinary human, but we can understand that You are performing these activities just like a dramatic artist.’”

### Verse text

*na hy ekasyādvitīyasya  
brahmaṇaḥ paramātmanaḥ  
karmabhir vardhate tejo  
hrasate ca yathā raveḥ*

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *hi* — indeed; *ekasya* — of the one; *advitīyasya* — without a second; *brahmaṇaḥ* — the Absolute Truth; *parama*-*ātmanaḥ* — the Supreme Soul; *karmabhiḥ* — by activities; *vardhate* — increases; *tejaḥ* — the power; *hrasate* — diminishes; *ca* — and; *yathā* — as; *raveḥ* — of the sun.

### Translation

**But of course the power of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Soul, the primeval one without a second, is neither increased nor diminished by His activities, any more than the sun’s power is by its movements.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes in *Kṛṣṇa:* “\[King Yudhiṣṭhira said,\] ‘Your real position is always exalted, exactly like that of the sun, which always remains at the same temperature, both during the time of its rising and the time of its setting. Although we feel the difference in temperature between the rising and the setting sun, the temperature of the sun never changes. You are always transcendentally equipoised, and thus You are neither pleased nor disturbed by any condition of material affairs. You are the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, and for You there are no relativities.’”

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes a similar statement from the Vedic *mantras:* *na karmaṇā vardhate no kanīyān* (*Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* 14.7.2.28, *Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa* 3.12.9.7 and *Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad* 4.4.23). “He is not increased by His activities, nor does He become lesser.” As explained here by King Yudhiṣṭhira, the Lord is one without a second. There is no other entity in His supreme category, and thus it is simply by His causeless mercy that He agrees to carry out the orders of His pure devotees, like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. There is certainly no loss of status for the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He thus extends His causeless mercy to His surrendered devotees.

*na vai te ’jita bhaktānāṁ  
mamāham iti mādhava  
tvaṁ taveti ca nānā-dhīḥ  
paśūnām iva vaikṛtī*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**O unconquerable Mādhava, even Your devotees make no distinctions of “I” and “mine,” “you” and “yours,” for this is the perverted mentality of animals.**

### Purport

An ordinary person thinks, “I am so attractive, intelligent and wealthy that people should simply serve me and do what I want. Why should I obey anyone else?” This proud, separatist mentality is also found in animals who battle one another for supremacy. Such a mentality is conspicuously absent in the mind of an advanced devotee, and it is certainly absent in the sublime, omniscient mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Purport

The great *Bhāgavatam* commentator Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the proper time for the sacrifice mentioned here was the spring.

### Translation

**On the day of extracting the soma juice, King Yudhiṣṭhira properly and very attentively worshiped the priests and the most exalted personalities of the assembly.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes in *Kṛṣṇa:* “According to the Vedic system, whenever there is an arrangement for sacrifice, the members participating in the sacrifice are offered the juice of the *soma* plant, which is a kind of life-giving beverage. On the day of extracting the *soma* juice, King Yudhiṣṭhira very respectfully received the special priest who had been engaged to detect any mistake in the formalities of sacrificial procedures. The idea is that the Vedic *mantras* must be enunciated perfectly and chanted with the proper accent; if the priests who are engaged in this business commit any mistake, the checker, or referee priest, immediately corrects the procedure, and thus the ritualistic performances are perfectly executed. Unless it is perfectly executed, a sacrifice cannot yield the desired result. In this Age of Kali there is no such learned *brāhmaṇa* or priest available; therefore, all such sacrifices are forbidden. The only sacrifice recommended in the *śāstras* is the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.”*

*sadasyāgryārhaṇārhaṁ vai  
vimṛśantaḥ sabhā-sadaḥ

### Synonyms

*sadasya* — of the members of the assembly; *agrya* — first; *arhaṇa* — worship; *arham* — him who deserves; *vai* — indeed; *vimṛśantaḥ* — pondering over; *sabhā* — in the assembly; *sadaḥ* — those seated; *na* *adhyagacchan* — they could not come to a conclusion; *anaika*-*antyāt* — because of the great number (of qualified candidates); *sahadevaḥ* — Sahadeva, the younger brother of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira; *tadā* — then; *abravīt* — spoke.

### Translation

**The members of the assembly then pondered over who among them should be worshiped first, but since there were many personalities qualified for this honor, they were unable to decide. Finally Sahadeva spoke up.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “Another important procedure is that the most exalted personality in the assembly of such a sacrificial ceremony is first offered worship.… This particular ceremony is called *agra-pūjā.* *Agra* means ‘first,’ and *pūjā* means ‘worship.’ This *agra-pūjā* is similar to the election of a president. In the sacrificial assembly, all the members were very exalted. Some proposed to elect one person as the perfect candidate for accepting *agra-pūjā,* and others proposed someone else.

As the great *ācārya* Jīva Gosvāmī points out, text 15 of this chapter states that the members of the assembly were not astonished at the opulence of the sacrifice, since they knew that King Yudhiṣṭhira was a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Still, text 18 now states that the assembly could not select the most deserving candidate for being worshiped first. This indicates that many of the *brāhmaṇas* present were not fully realized transcendentalists but rather conventional *brāhmaṇas* uncertain of the supreme conclusion of Vedic wisdom.

Similarly, Ācārya Viśvanātha comments that the undecided members of the assembly were the less intelligent ones, and not such exalted personalities as Brahmā, Śiva and Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva, who thought, “Since today no one is asking our opinion, why should we say anything? Furthermore, here is Sahadeva, who is renowned for his sharp skill in analyzing all sorts of circumstances. He can help appoint the person who is to be worshiped first. Only if he somehow fails to speak or cannot understand the situation will we speak up, despite no one’s having inquired from us.” Having made up their minds in this way, the greatest personalities remained silent. This is how Viśvanātha Cakravartī advises us to understand what occurred in the assembly.

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes as follows: “\[Sahadeva said:\] ‘Ladies and gentlemen, it is superfluous to speak about Kṛṣṇa, because every one of you exalted personalities knows the Supreme Brahman, Lord Kṛṣṇa, for whom there are no material differences between body and soul, between energy and the energetic, or between one part of the body and another. Since everyone is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, there is no qualitative difference between Kṛṣṇa and all living entities. Everything is an emanation of Kṛṣṇa’s energies, the material and spiritual. Kṛṣṇa’s energies are like the heat and light of the fire; there is no difference between the qualities of heat and light and the fire itself.… He should therefore be offered the first worship of this great sacrifice, and no one should disagree.… Kṛṣṇa is present as the Supersoul in every living being, and if we can satisfy Him, then automatically every living being becomes satisfied.’”

### Translation

**The intolerant son of Damaghoṣa became infuriated upon hearing the glorification of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental qualities. He stood up from his seat and, angrily waving his arms, fearlessly spoke to the entire assembly the following harsh words against the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “In that meeting, King Śiśupāla was also present. He was an avowed enemy of Kṛṣṇa for many reasons, especially because of Kṛṣṇa’s having stolen Rukmiṇī from the marriage ceremony; therefore, he could not tolerate such honor to Kṛṣṇa and glorification of His qualities. Instead of being happy to hear the glories of the Lord, he became very angry.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī mentions that the reason Śiśupāla did not object when Sahadeva proposed Kṛṣṇa for the *agra-pūjā* is that Śiśupāla wanted to ruin King Yudhiṣṭhira’s sacrifice. If Śiśupāla had argued earlier against Lord Kṛṣṇa’s receiving the first worship and another person had been selected, the sacrifice would have then proceeded normally. Therefore Śiśupāla allowed Kṛṣṇa to be selected, waited until the worship was over, and then spoke up, hoping in this way to demonstrate that the sacrifice was now spoiled. Thus he would ruin the endeavor of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. In this regard the *ācārya* quotes the following *smṛti* reference: *apūjyā yatra pūjyante pūjyānāṁ ca vyatikramaḥ.* “In the place where those who are not to be worshiped are worshiped, there is offense to those who are actually worshipable.” There is also the following statement: *pratibadhnāti hi śreyaḥ pūjyapūjya-vyatikramaḥ.* “Improperly understanding who is to be worshiped and who is not to be worshiped will impede one’s progress in life.”

### Translation

**How can you pass over the most exalted members of this assembly — topmost sages dedicated to the Absolute Truth endowed with powers of austerity, divine insight and strict adherence to severe vows, sanctified by knowledge and worshiped even by the rulers of the universe? How does this cowherd boy, the disgrace of His family, deserve your worship, any more than a crow deserves to eat the sacred puroḍāśa rice cake?**

### Purport

The great commentator Śrīdhara Svāmī has analyzed Śiśupāla’s words as follows. The term *go-pāla* means not only “cowherd” but also “protector of the *Vedas* and the earth.” Similarly, *kula-pāṁsana* has a double meaning. Śiśupāla intended it to mean “the disgrace of His family,” which is its meaning when divided as above. But the word may also be analyzed as *ku-lapām aṁsana,* giving a totally different meaning. *Kulapām* indicates those who prattle with crooked words contrary to the *Vedas,* and *aṁsana,* derived from the verb *aṁsayati,* means “destroyer.” In other words, he was praising Lord Kṛṣṇa as “He who vanquishes all misguided and frivolous speculations about the nature of truth.” Similarly, although Śiśupāla wanted to compare Lord Kṛṣṇa to a crow with the words *yathā kākaḥ,* these words may also be divided *yathā a-kākaḥ.* In that case, according to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the word *kāka* is a combination of *ka* and *āka,* which indicate material happiness and misery. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa is *akāka* in the sense that He is beyond all material misery and happiness, being on the pure, transcendental platform. Finally, Śiśupāla was right in saying the Lord Kṛṣṇa does not deserve merely the *puroḍāśa* rice cake, offered to the lesser demigods as a substitute for the heavenly beverage *soma.* In fact, Lord Kṛṣṇa deserves to receive everything that we possess, since He is the ultimate proprietor of everything, including ourselves. Thus we should give Lord Kṛṣṇa our life and soul, not merely a ritualistic offering of rice cakes.

**How does one who follows no principles of the social and spiritual orders or of family ethics, who has been excluded from all religious duties, who behaves whimsically, and who has no good qualities — how does such a person deserve to be worshiped?**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “Actually, Kṛṣṇa does not belong to any caste, nor does He have to perform any occupational duty. It is stated in the *Vedas* that the Supreme Lord has nothing to do as His prescribed duty. Whatever has to be done on His behalf is executed by His different energies.… Śiśupāla indirectly praised Kṛṣṇa by saying that He is not within the jurisdiction of Vedic injunction. This is true because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That He has no qualities means that Kṛṣṇa has no material qualities, and because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He acts independently, not caring for conventions or social or religious principles.”

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the inner meaning of the words of Śiśupāla to show how he continued unintentionally glorifying Lord Kṛṣṇa and His Yadu dynasty: “Even though the Yadus were cursed by Yayāti, they have been relieved \[*bahis-kṛtam*\] of this curse by great saints, and consequently they have been raised to a position of royal sovereignty by such persons as Kārtavīrya. Thus they have become absorbed in *pāna,* protecting the earth. Considering all this, how does Kṛṣṇa, the chief of the Yadus, deserve useless \[*vṛthā*\] worship? Rather, He deserves opulent worship.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains the Lord’s action as follows: If Lord Kṛṣṇa had done nothing, there probably would have been a savage fight on the sacrificial grounds, and thus the whole ceremony would have been drenched in blood, spoiling the sanctified atmosphere. Therefore, in order to protect the Rājasūya sacrifice of Kṛṣṇa’s beloved devotee Yudhiṣṭhira, the Lord immediately severed Śiśupāla’s head with His razor-sharp disc in such a way that not a drop of blood fell within the sacrificial grounds.

चैद्यदेहोत्थितं ज्योतिर्वासुदेवमुपाविशत् ।

### Verse text

*caidya-dehotthitaṁ jyotir

### Purport

In this connection, the *ācāryas* remind us that Śiśupāla is actually one of the Lord’s eternal associates playing the part of a belligerent demon. Thus to most observers it appeared that Śiśupāla achieved the impersonal liberation of merging into Lord Kṛṣṇa’s bodily effulgence. In fact, after being liberated from his mortal frame, Śiśupāla returned to the side of his master, the Supreme Lord of the spiritual world. The following verse further explains this.

## Text 46

### Devanagari

जन्मत्रयानुगुणितवैरसंरब्धया धिया ।

### Verse text

*janma-trayānuguṇita-  
vaira-saṁrabdhayā dhiyā  
dhyāyaṁs tan-mayatāṁ yāto  
bhāvo hi bhava-kāraṇam*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Obsessed with hatred of Lord Kṛṣṇa throughout three lifetimes, Śiśupāla attained the Lord’s transcendental nature. Indeed, one’s consciousness determines one’s future birth.**

### Purport

Śiśupāla and his friend Dantavakra, who will be killed by Kṛṣṇa in Chapter Seventy-eight, were previously Jaya and Vijaya, two gatekeepers in Vaikuṇṭha. Because of an offense, the four Kumāras cursed them to take three births in the material world as demons. The first birth was as Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, the second as Rāvaṇa and Kumbhakarṇa, and the third as Śiśupāla and Dantavakra. In each birth they were completely absorbed in enmity toward the Lord and were slain by Him.

Śrīla Prabhupāda explains the position of Śiśupāla as follows: “Although Śiśupāla acted as the enemy of Kṛṣṇa, he was not for a single moment out of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was always absorbed in thought of Kṛṣṇa, and thus he got the salvation of *sāyujya-mukti,* merging into the existence of the Supreme, and finally became reinstated in his original position of personal service. The *Bhagavad-gītā* corroborates the fact that one who is absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Lord at the time of death immediately enters the kingdom of God after quitting his material body.”

The Third and Seventh cantos of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* elaborately describe the incident wherein the Lord’s personal associates were cursed to come to the material world as His enemies. In this connection, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes the following verse (*Bhāg.* 7.1.47):

*vairānubandha-tīvreṇa  
dhyānenācyuta-sātmatām  
nītau punar hareḥ pārśvaṁ  
jagmatur viṣṇu-pārṣadau*

“These two associates of Lord Viṣṇu — Jaya and Vijaya — maintained a feeling of enmity for a very long time. Because of always thinking of Kṛṣṇa in this way, they regained the shelter of the Lord, having returned home, back to Godhead.”

Thus the Lord personally saw to the successful completion of the King’s sacrificial performance. And after that He agreed to stay with His dear friends in Indraprastha for a few more months.
