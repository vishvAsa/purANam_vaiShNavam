CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE

This chapter relates a conversation between Draupadī and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s foremost queens, in which each of them describes how the Lord married her.

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa returned from His meeting with the *gopīs* and asked King Yudhiṣṭhira and His other relatives whether they were well. They replied, “My Lord, anyone who has just once imbibed through his ears the honey of Your pastimes can never know misfortune.”

Then Draupadī inquired from Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives how the Lord had come to marry them. Queen Rukmiṇī spoke first: “Many kings, headed by Jarāsandha, were intent on giving me in marriage to Śiśupāla. Thus at my wedding they all stood with bows in hand, ready to support Śiśupāla against any opponents. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa came and forcibly took me away, as a lion takes his prey from amidst goats and sheep.”

Queen Satyabhāmā said, “When my uncle Prasena was killed, my father, Satrājit, falsely accused Lord Kṛṣṇa of murder. To clear His name, Kṛṣṇa defeated Jāmbavān, recovered the Syamantaka jewel and returned it to Satrājit. Repentant, my father presented the Lord with both the jewel and myself.”

Queen Jāmbavatī said, “When Śrī Kṛṣṇa entered my father’s cave in search of the Syamantaka jewel, at first my father, Jāmbavān, did not understand who He was. So my father fought with Him for twenty-seven days and nights. Finally, Jāmbavān understood that Kṛṣṇa was none other than Lord Rāmacandra, his worshipable Lord. Thus he gave Kṛṣṇa the Syamantaka jewel, along with me.”

Queen Kālindī said, “To obtain Kṛṣṇa as my husband, I performed severe austerities. Then one day Lord Kṛṣṇa came to me in the company of Arjuna, and at that time the Lord agreed to marry me.”

Queen Mitravindā said, “Śrī Kṛṣṇa came to my *svayaṁvara* ceremony, where He defeated all the opposing kings and took me away to His city of Dvārakā.”

Queen Satyā said, “My father stipulated that to win my hand, a prospective suitor would have to subdue and tie up seven powerful bulls. Accepting this challenge, Lord Kṛṣṇa playfully subdued them, defeated all His rival suitors and married me.”

Queen Bhadrā said, “My father invited his nephew Kṛṣṇa, to whom I had already given my heart, and offered me to Him as His bride. The dowry was an entire military division and a retinue of my female companions.”

Queen Lakṣmaṇā said to Draupadī, “At my *svayaṁvara,* as at yours, a fish-target was fastened near the ceiling. But in my case the fish was concealed on all sides, and only its reflection could be seen in a pot of water below. Several kings tried to hit the fish with an arrow but failed. Arjuna then made his attempt. He concentrated on the reflection of the fish in the water and took careful aim, but when he released his arrow it only grazed the target. Then Śrī Kṛṣṇa fixed His arrow on the bow and shot it straight through the target, knocking it to the ground. I placed the victory necklace on Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s neck, but the kings who had failed raised a violent protest. Lord Kṛṣṇa valiantly fought them, cutting off the heads, arms and legs of many and sending the rest fleeing for their lives. Then the Lord took me to Dvārakā for our lavish wedding.”

Rohiṇī-devī, representing all the other queens, explained that they were daughters of the kings defeated by Bhaumāsura. The demon had held them captive, but when Lord Kṛṣṇa killed him He had released them and married them all.

तथानुगृह्य भगवान् गोपीनां स गुरुर्गति- ।

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*tathānugṛhya bhagavān  
gopīnāṁ sa gurur gatiḥ  
yudhiṣṭhiram athāpṛcchat  
sarvāṁś ca suhṛdo ’vyayam*

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual master of the gopīs and the very purpose of their life, showed them His mercy. He then met with Yudhiṣṭhira and all His other relatives and inquired from them about their welfare.**

### Purport

The words *gurur gatiḥ* have been translated here in their usual sense: “spiritual master and goal.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, however, points out an additional meaning: While Lord Kṛṣṇa is the goal for all *sādhus* in general, for the *gopīs* specifically He is that goal which is *guru,* “predominant,” in the sense of completely eclipsing the significance of all other possible goals.

It destroys the embodied souls’ forgetfulness of the creator of their bodily existence.**

### Purport

Simply by the effulgent light emanating from the beautiful form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one’s intelligence is purified of all material contamination, and thus the soul’s various entanglements in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are dispelled. “How then,” the Lord’s relatives imply, “can we ever suffer misfortune? We are always immersed in absolute happiness.” This is their answer to His inquiry about their welfare.

The Rohiṇī addressed here by Draupadī is not Lord Balarāma’s mother but another Rohiṇī, the foremost of the sixteen thousand princesses Lord Kṛṣṇa rescued from the prison of Bhaumāsura. Draupadī turns to her as the representative of all sixteen thousand, and as a virtual equal to Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s eight chief queens.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*satyabhāmā* *uvāca* — Śrī Satyabhāmā said; *yaḥ* — who; *me* — my; *sanābhi* — of my brother; *vadha* — by the killing; *tapta* — distressed; *hṛdā* — whose heart; *tatena* — by my father; *lipta* — tainted; *abhiśāpam* — with condemnation; *apamārṣṭum* — to cleanse away; *upājahāra* — He removed; *jitvā* — after defeating; *ṛkṣa*-*rājam* — the king of the bears, Jāmbavān; *atha* — then; *ratnam* — the jewel (Syamantaka); *adāt* — gave; *saḥ* — He; *tena* — because of this; *bhītaḥ* — afraid; *pitā* — my father; *adiśata* — offered; *mām* — me; *prabhave* — to the Lord; *api* — although; *dattām* — already given.

### Translation

**Śrī Satyabhāmā said: My father, his heart tormented by his brother’s death, accused Kṛṣṇa of killing him. To remove the stain on His reputation, the Lord defeated the king of the bears and took back the Syamantaka jewel, which He then returned to my father. Fearing the consequences of his offense, my father offered me to the Lord, even though I had already been promised to others.**

### Purport

As described in Chapter Fifty-six of this canto, King Satrājit had already compromised himself by promising his daughter’s hand first to Akrūra and then again to a number of other suitors. But after the return of the Syamantaka jewel, he felt impelled by his shame to offer her to Lord Kṛṣṇa instead. According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the word *prabhave* (“unto the Lord”) answers any doubt as to the propriety of offering Kṛṣṇa a bride who had already been promised to others. It is perfectly proper to offer Him everything one owns, and improper to withhold anything from Him.

When my father finally came to his senses and recognized the Lord, he took hold of His feet and presented Him with both me and the Syamantaka jewel as tokens of his reverence. I am simply the Lord’s maidservant.**

### Purport

Jāmbavān had been Lord Rāmacandra’s servant many thousands of years before. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī mentions that while hearing Jāmbavatī’s story, the women present recognized her as the girl whom Jāmbavān had once offered to Lord Śrī Rāma to be His wife. Since Lord Rāma had taken a vow to have only one wife, He could not accept her then, but did so when He returned in the Dvāpara-yuga as Kṛṣṇa. The other queens wanted to honor Jāmbavatī for this, but she replied humbly, “I am just the Lord’s maidservant.”

How Jāmbavatī and Satyabhāmā became Lord Kṛṣṇa’s wives is told in Chapter Fifty-six of the Tenth Canto.

**Śrī Satyā said: My father arranged for seven extremely powerful and vigorous bulls with deadly sharp horns to test the prowess of the kings who desired my hand in marriage. Although these bulls destroyed the false pride of many heroes, Lord Kṛṣṇa subdued them effortlessly, tying them up in the same way that children playfully tie up a goat’s kids. He thus purchased me with His valor. Then He took me away with my maidservants and a full army of four divisions, defeating all the kings who opposed Him along the road. May I be granted the privilege of serving that Lord.**

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhadrā* *uvāca* — Śrī Bhadrā said; *pitā* — father; *me* — my; *mātuleyāya* — to my maternal cousin; *svayam* — of his own accord; *āhūya* — inviting; *dattavān* — gave; *kṛṣṇe* — O Kṛṣṇā (Draupadī); *kṛṣṇāya* — to Lord Kṛṣṇa; *tat* — absorbed in whom; *cittām* — whose heart; *akṣauhiṇyā* — with an *akṣauhiṇī* military guard; *sakhī*-*janaiḥ* — and with my female companions; *asya* — His; *me* — for me; *pāda* — of the feet; *saṁsparśaḥ* — the touch; *bhavet* — may it be; *janmani* *janmani* — in one life after another; *karmabhiḥ* — due to the reactions of material activities; *bhrāmyamāṇāyāḥ* — who will be wandering; *yena* — by which; *tat* — that; *śreyaḥ* — ultimate perfection; *ātmanaḥ* — of myself.

### Translation

**Śrī Bhadrā said: My dear Draupadī, of his own free will my father invited his nephew Kṛṣṇa, to whom I had already dedicated my heart, and offered me to Him as His bride. My father presented me to the Lord with an akṣauhiṇi military guard and a retinue of my female companions. My ultimate perfection is this: to always be allowed to touch Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet as I wander from life to life, bound by my karma.**

### Purport

With the word *ātmanaḥ,* Queen Bhadrā speaks not only for herself but for all living entities as well. The soul’s perfection (*śreya ātmanaḥ*) is devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, both in this world and beyond, in liberation.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī comments that although in civilized society it is normally considered disrespectful to publicly speak the name of one’s *guru* or husband, Lord Kṛṣṇa’s name is unique: the mere utterance of the name Kṛṣṇa is commendable as the highest expression of reverence for God. As the *Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad* (4.19) states, *yasya nāma mahad yaśaḥ:* “The holy name of the Lord is supremely glorious.”

### Purport

Arjuna is famous as the most expert bowman. Why, then, could he not hit the fish target at Śrīmatī Lakṣmaṇā’s *svayaṁvara* ceremony just as he had done once before to win Draupadī? Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains: The target at Draupadī’s *svayaṁvara* had been covered only partially, so that a marksman could see it if he looked straight up the pillar on which it was placed. To shoot Lakṣmaṇā’s target, however, it was necessary to aim by looking up and down at the same time, an impossible feat for any mortal. Therefore only Kṛṣṇa could strike the target.

### Purport

The Supreme Lord is *pūrṇa,* perfect and complete in Himself. He requires nothing for His satisfaction. Knowing this, a pure devotee makes offerings to the Lord only out of love, *bhaktitaḥ,* with no expectation of material profit. And on His part, the Lord happily accepts even a small gift of flowers, *tulasī* leaves and water when it has been offered in love.

*ātmārāmasya tasyemā

### Synonyms

*ātma*-*ārāmasya* — of the self-satisfied; *tasya* — Him; *imāḥ* — these; *vayam* — we; *vai* — indeed; *gṛha* — in the home; *dāsikāḥ* — maidservants; *sarva* — all; *saṅga* — of material association; *nivṛttyā* — by the cessation; *addhā* — directly; *tapasā* — by austerity; *ca* — and; *babhūvima* — have become.

### Translation

**Thus, by renouncing all material association and practicing austere penances, we queens have all become personal maidservants of the self-satisfied Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

In the opinion of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Śrīmatī Lakṣmaṇā became embarrassed when she realized that she had been talking about herself, and so she spoke this verse praising her co-wives. In her humility Lakṣmaṇā claimed that Kṛṣṇa’s queens, unlike ordinary wives, could not bring their husband under control, and thus they could relate to Him only as servile housekeepers. In fact, however, since the Lord’s queens are direct expansions of His internal pleasure potency (*hlādinī-śakti*), they fully controlled Him with their love.

### Translation

**Rohiṇī-devi, speaking for the other queens, said: After killing Bhaumāsura and his followers, the Lord found us in the demon’s prison and could understand that we were the daughters of the kings whom Bhauma had defeated during his conquest of the earth. The Lord set us free, and because we had been constantly meditating upon His lotus feet, the source of liberation from material entanglement, He agreed to marry us, though His every desire is already fulfilled.**

### Purport

Rohiṇī-devī was one of the nine queens questioned by Draupadī in texts 6 and 7, and thus it is assumed that she speaks here, representing the 16,099 other queens. Śrīla Prabhupāda confirms this in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.*

### Translation

**O saintly lady, we do not desire dominion over the earth, the sovereignty of the King of heaven, unlimited facility for enjoyment, mystic power, the position of Lord Brahmā, immortality or even attainment of the kingdom of God. We simply desire to carry on our heads the glorious dust of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s feet, enriched by the fragrance of kuṅkuma from His consort’s bosom.**

### Purport

The verb *rāj* means “to rule,” and from it are derived the words *sāmrājyam,* meaning “rulership over the entire earth,” and *svārājyam,* meaning “rulership over heaven.” *Bhaujyam* comes from the verb *bhuj,* “to enjoy,” and thus refers to the capacity of enjoying whatever one desires. *Virāṭ* is explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī as representing the phrase *vividhaṁ virājate* (“one enjoys many kinds of opulence”) and specifically indicating the eight mystic perfections of *aṇimā* and so on.

An alternative explanation of these terms is given by Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, who says that according to the *Bahv-ṛca Brāhmaṇa,* these four terms designate the power of sovereignty over each of the four cardinal directions: *sāmrājya* for the East, *bhaujya* for the South, *svārājya* for the West, and *vairājya* for the North.

Lord Kṛṣṇa’s queens clearly state that they do not desire any of these powers, or even the position of Brahmā, liberation or entrance into the kingdom of God. They simply want the dust from Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s feet, which Goddess Śrī herself worships. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī tells us that the goddess of fortune mentioned here is not Lakṣmī, the consort of Nārāyaṇa. After all, the *ācārya* explains, Goddess Lakṣmī could not attain the direct association of Kṛṣṇa even after performing extended austerities, as Uddhava states: *nāyaṁ śrīyo ’ṅga u nitānta-rateḥ prasādaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 10.47.60). Rather, the Śrī referred to here is the supreme goddess of fortune identified by the *Bṛhad-gautamīya-tantra:*

*devī kṛṣṇa-mayī proktā  
rādhikā para-devatā  
sarva-lakṣmī-mayī sarva  
kāntiḥ sammohinī parā*

“The transcendental goddess Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the direct counterpart of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She is the central figure for all the goddesses of fortune. She possesses all the attractiveness to attract the all-attractive Personality of Godhead. She is the primeval internal potency of the Lord.”

*vraja-striyo yad vāñchanti  
pulindyas tṛṇa-vīrudhaḥ

pada-sparśaṁ mahātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*vraja* — of Vraja; *striyaḥ* — the women; *yat* — as; *vāñchanti* — they desire; *pulindyaḥ* — the women of the aborigine Pulinda tribe in Vraja; *tṛṇa* — from the grass; *vīrudhaḥ* — and plants; *gāvaḥ* — the cows; *cārayataḥ* — who is grazing; *gopāḥ* — the cowherd boys; *pāda* — of the feet; *sparśam* — the touch; *mahā*-*ātmanaḥ* — of the Supreme Soul.

### Translation

**We desire the same contact with the Supreme Lord’s feet that the young women of Vraja, the cowherd boys and even the aborigine Pulinda women desire — the touch of the dust He leaves on the plants and grass as He tends His cows.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī reminds us of the jealous rivalry that always existed between the queens of Dvārakā and the *gopīs* of Vraja. The *gopīs* considered the sophisticated women of Dvārakā the most serious threat to their hold on Śrī Kṛṣṇa, confessing their anxiety to Uddhava: *kasmāt kṛṣṇa ihāyāti prāpta-rājyo hatāhitaḥ/ narendra-kanyā udvāhya.*

“Why should Kṛṣṇa come back here after winning a kingdom, killing His enemies and marrying the daughters of kings?” (*Bhāg.* 10.47.45)

Rukmiṇī and her seven chief co-wives considered themselves so fortunate in their relationship with Kṛṣṇa as He appeared in Dvārakā that they did not especially desire to see Him as He is in Vṛndāvana. But the sixteen thousand lesser queens, after hearing Uddhava describe Śrī Rādhā’s superexcellent qualities, became attracted to touch the dust that falls from Kṛṣṇa’s feet onto the grass and plants of Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī indicates that some commentators give this as the reason why, after the *mauṣala-līlā,* these sixteen thousand queens were stolen from Arjuna on the road by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in the disguise of sixteen thousand cowherds, who then took them away to Gokula.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Eighty-third Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Draupadī Meets the Queens of Kṛṣṇa.”*
