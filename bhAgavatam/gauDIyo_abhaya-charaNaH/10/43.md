CHAPTER FORTY-THREE

This chapter tells how Lord Kṛṣṇa killed the lordly elephant Kuvalayāpīḍa, how Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma entered the wrestling arena and what Kṛṣṇa said to the wrestler Cāṇūra.

After finishing Their early-morning rituals, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma heard kettledrums heralding the start of the wrestling match, and They went to see the festivities. At the gate of the wrestling arena They encountered an elephant named Kuvalayāpīḍa, who attacked Kṛṣṇa at the urging of his keeper. The mighty elephant grabbed at Kṛṣṇa with his trunk, but the Lord struck back and then disappeared from the beast’s sight among his legs. Enraged at not being able to see Kṛṣṇa, Kuvalayāpīḍa sought Him out with his sense of smell and seized Him. But the Lord pulled loose. In this way Kṛṣṇa teased and tormented Kuvalayāpīḍa, finally yanking out one of his tusks and beating him and his keepers to death.

Sprinkled with the elephant’s blood and carrying one of his tusks on His shoulder as a weapon, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared unprecedentedly beautiful as He entered the wrestling arena. There the various classes of people saw Him in different ways, according to their specific relationship with Him.

When King Kaṁsa heard how Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had killed Kuvalayāpīḍa, he realized They were invincible and became filled with anxiety. The members of the audience, on the other hand, became joyful as they reminded one another about the Lords’ amazing pastimes. The people declared that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma must be two expansions of the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa who had descended into the house of Vasudeva.

Cāṇūra then stepped forward and challenged Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to wrestle, saying King Kaṁsa wished to see such a match. Kṛṣṇa replied, “Although We are merely nomadic forest folk, We are nonetheless subjects of the King; thus We will not hesitate to please him with an exhibition of wrestling.” As soon as Cāṇūra heard this, he suggested that Kṛṣṇa should wrestle him and that Balarāma should wrestle Muṣṭika.

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains the words *kṛta-śaucau,* “having executed all necessary purification,” as follows: “Two days previously, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had executed Their purification, Their relief from offense \[by performing heroic deeds\]. The Lords reasoned: ‘Even after We have made Our power known by breaking the bow and by performing other feats, Our parents have still not secured freedom. Kaṁsa is again trying to kill them. Therefore, although he is Our maternal uncle, it will not be wrong for Us to kill him.’ They assured Their offenselessness by this reasoning.”

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes the following verse, which explains the ten attitudes toward Kṛṣṇa described here:

*raudro ’dbhutaś ca śṛṅgāro  
hāsyaṁ vīro dayā tathā  
bhayānakaś ca bībhatsaḥ  
śāntaḥ sa-prema-bhaktikaḥ*

“\[There are ten different moods:\] fury \[perceived by the wrestlers\], wonder \[by the men\], conjugal attraction \[the women\], laughter \[the cowherds\], chivalry \[the kings\], mercy \[His parents\], terror \[Kaṁsa\], ghastliness \[the unintelligent\], peaceful neutrality \[the *yogīs*\] and loving devotion \[the Vṛṣṇis\].”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that people like the wrestlers, Kaṁsa and the impious rulers perceive Kṛṣṇa as dangerous, angry or threatening because they fail to understand the actual position of the Personality of Godhead. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa is everyone’s friend and well-wisher, but because we rebel against Him, He chastises us, and thus we may perceive Him as threatening. Kṛṣṇa, or God, is actually merciful, and when He punishes us, that is also His mercy.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura quotes the following Vedic statement: *raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hy evāyaṁ labdhvānandī bhavati.* “He Himself is *rasa,* the taste or mellow of a particular relationship. And certainly one who achieves this *rasa* becomes *ānandī,* filled with bliss.” (*Taittirīya Upaniṣad* 2.7.1)

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī quotes a further verse to explain the word *rasa:*

*vyatītya bhāvanā-vartma  
yaś camatkāra-bhāra-bhūḥ  
hṛdi sattvojjvale bāḍhaṁ  
svadate sa raso mataḥ*

“That which is beyond imagination, heavy with wonder and relished in the heart shining with goodness — such is known as *rasa.*”

As Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī elaborately explains in his *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,* there are five main *rasas* — neutrality, servitude, friendship, parental love and conjugal love — and seven secondary *rasas* — amazement, humor, chivalry, compassion, fury, fear and dread. Thus altogether there are twelve *rasas,* and the supreme object of them all is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. In other words, our love and affection are actually meant for Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, out of ignorance we stubbornly try to squeeze happiness and love out of material relationships, which are not directly connected to Kṛṣṇa, and thus life becomes a constant frustration. The solution is simple: surrender to Kṛṣṇa, love Kṛṣṇa, love Kṛṣṇa’s devotees and be happy forever.

### Purport

Naturally, those who assembled in Mathurā for the wrestling festival had heard the latest news of Kṛṣṇa’s and Balarāma’s adventures in the city — how the Lords had broken the sacrificial bow, defeated the police and killed the elephant Kuvalayāpīḍa. And now that the people were seeing Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma enter the arena, their greatest expectations were confirmed. Kṛṣṇa is the embodiment of all beauty, fame and opulence, and therefore those assembled in the wrestling arena became fully satisfied by glorifying what they had heard of Him and were now seeing.
