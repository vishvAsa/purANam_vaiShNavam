CHAPTER FIFTY

This chapter relates how Lord Kṛṣṇa defeated Jarāsandha seventeen times in battle and then constructed the city of Dvārakā.

After Kaṁsa was killed, his two queens, Asti and Prāpti, went to the home of their father, Jarāsandha, and sorrowfully described to him how Kṛṣṇa had made them widows. Upon hearing this account, King Jarāsandha became angry. He vowed to rid the earth of all the Yādavas, and he gathered an immense army to lay siege to Mathurā. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa saw Jarāsandha attacking, the Lord considered the reasons for His descent to this world and then decided to destroy Jarāsandha’s army, which was a burden to the earth.

Two effulgent chariots suddenly appeared, equipped with drivers and furnishings, together with all the Lord’s personal weapons. Seeing this, Lord Kṛṣṇa addressed Lord Baladeva, “My dear brother, Jarāsandha is now attacking Mathurā-purī, so please mount Your chariot and let Us go destroy the enemy’s army.” The two Lords took up Their weapons, mounted Their chariots and went forth from the city.

When Lord Kṛṣṇa came before His opponent’s army, He sounded His conchshell, striking fear into His enemies’ hearts. King Jarāsandha surrounded Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma with his soldiers, chariots and so on, and the women of the city, having climbed up to the roofs of the palaces, became extremely unhappy because they could not see the Lords. Then Kṛṣṇa twanged His bow and started to rain down a torrent of arrows upon the enemy soldiers. Soon Jarāsandha’s unfathomable army had been annihilated.

Then Lord Baladeva arrested Jarāsandha and was about to bind him up with ropes when Śrī Kṛṣṇa had Baladeva release the King. Lord Kṛṣṇa reasoned that Jarāsandha would assemble another army and return again to fight; this would facilitate Kṛṣṇa’s goal of removing the earth’s burden. Released, Jarāsandha returned to Magadha and vowed to perform austerities with the aim of avenging his defeat. The other kings advised him that his defeat was only a reaction of his *karma.* Thus informed, King Jarāsandha withdrew to his kingdom with a heavy heart.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa rejoined the citizens of Mathurā, who began rejoicing, singing songs of triumph and arranging victory celebrations. The Lord brought all the warriors’ jewelry and ornaments that had been picked up from the battlefield and presented them to Mahārāja Ugrasena.

Jarāsandha attacked the Yādavas in Mathurā seventeen times, and each time his armies were totally destroyed. Then, as Jarāsandha prepared to attack for the eighteenth time, a warrior named Kālayavana, who had been searching for a worthy opponent, was sent by Nārada Muni to fight the Yādavas. With thirty million soldiers Kālayavana laid siege to the Yādava capital. Lord Kṛṣṇa looked upon this attack with concern, for He knew that with Jarāsandha’s arrival imminent, there was a serious danger that the simultaneous attack of these two enemies might endanger the Yādavas. Therefore the Lord constructed a wonderful city within the sea as a safe haven for the Yādavas; then He brought them all there by His mystic power. This city was fully populated with members of all four social orders, and within it no one felt the pangs of thirst and hunger. The various demigods, headed by Indra, each offered as tribute to Lord Kṛṣṇa the same opulences they had originally obtained from Him to establish their positions of authority.

Once He saw His subjects safely settled, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa took permission from Lord Baladeva and went out of Mathurā unarmed.

*cintayām āsa bhagavān

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Although Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the original cause of this world, when He descended to the earth He played the role of a human being. Thus when He saw Jarāsandha’s assembled army surrounding His city like a great ocean overflowing its shores, and when He saw how this army was striking fear into His subjects, the Lord considered what His suitable response should be according to the time, place and specific purpose of His current incarnation.**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* point out that the Supreme Godhead did not have to worry about a mortal attack from Jarāsandha and his soldiers. But, as stated here, Śrī Kṛṣṇa was playing the part of a human being (*kāraṇa-mānuṣaḥ*), and He played the part well. This play is called *līlā,* the Lord’s enactment of spiritual pastimes for the pleasure of His devotees. Although ordinary persons may be dumbfounded by the Lord’s pastimes, the devotees derive tremendous pleasure from His inimitable style of behavior. Thus Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that Śrī Kṛṣṇa thought as follows: “How should I defeat Jarāsandha? Should I kill the army but not Jarāsandha, or should I kill Jarāsandha and take the army for Myself? Or perhaps I should just kill both of them.” Lord Kṛṣṇa’s conclusion is described in the following verses.

But Jarāsandha himself should not be killed, since in the future he will certainly assemble another army.**

### Purport

After due consideration, Lord Kṛṣṇa decided that since He had descended to the earth to destroy the demons, and since Jarāsandha was so enthusiastic to bring all the demons to the Lord’s front door, it was definitely more efficient to keep Jarāsandha alive and busy.

na tvayā yoddhum icchāmi

na yotsye yāhi bandhu-han*

### Synonyms

*tau* — to the two of Them; *āha* — said; *māgadhaḥ* — Jarāsandha; *vīkṣya* — watching; *he* *kṛṣṇa* — O Kṛṣṇa; *puruṣa*-*adhama* — lowest of men; *na* — not; *tvayā* — with You; *yoddhum* — to fight; *icchāmi* — do I want; *bālena* — with a boy; *ekena* — alone; *lajjayā* — shamefully; *guptena* — hidden; *hi* — indeed; *tvayā* — with You; *manda* — O fool; *na* *yotsye* — I will not fight; *yāhi* — go away; *bandhu* — of relatives; *han* — O killer.

### Translation

**Jarāsandha looked at the two of Them and said: O Kṛṣṇa, lowest of men! I do not wish to fight alone with You, since it would be a shame to fight with a mere boy. You fool who keep Yourself hidden, O murderer of Your relatives, go away! I will not fight with You.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has interpreted Jarāsandha’s words as follows. *Puruṣādhama* can be understood as *puruṣā adhamā yasmāt,* meaning “Kṛṣṇa, to whom all men are inferior.” In other words, here Lord Kṛṣṇa is being addressed as “O Puruṣottama, best of living beings.” Similarly, the word *guptena,* “hidden,” indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa’s aspect of being in everyone’s heart and invisible to material vision. The words *tvayā manda* can also be divided, according to Sanskrit grammar, as *tvayā amanda.* In this case Jarāsandha is indicating that Kṛṣṇa is not foolish but rather most alert. The word *bandhu* was used by Jarāsandha in the sense of “relative,” since Lord Kṛṣṇa killed His maternal uncle, Kaṁsa. However, *bandhu* comes from the verb *bandh,* “to bind,” and therefore *bandhu-han* can be understood as “one who destroys the bondage of ignorance.” Similarly, the word *yāhi,* “please go,” indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa should approach the living beings and bless them to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

### Purport

According to *ācārya* Śrīdhara Svāmī, Jarāsandha suspected that Lord Balarāma’s body was indestructible, and thus he offered what might be a more practical alternative, that Balarāma kill Jarāsandha.

### Purport

Ācārya Śrīdhara points out that clouds only seem to cover the sun: the sun remains shining in the vast sky. Nor is the potency of fire affected by a thin covering of dust. Similarly, the “covering” of Jarāsandha’s military strength was only apparent.

### Purport

The women are especially mentioned here because of their extraordinary attachment to Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma.

### Translation

**On the battlefield, hundreds of rivers of blood flowed from the limbs of the humans, elephants and horses who had been cut to pieces. In these rivers arms resembled snakes; human heads, turtles; dead elephants, islands; and dead horses, crocodiles. Hands and thighs appeared like fish, human hair like waterweeds, bows like waves, and various weapons like clumps of bushes. The rivers of blood teemed with all of these.**

### Purport

**Chariot wheels looked like terrifying whirlpools, and precious gems and ornaments resembled stones and gravel in the rushing red rivers, which aroused fear in the timid, joy in the wise. With the blows of His plow weapon the immeasurably powerful Lord Balarāma destroyed Magadhendra’s military force. And though this force was as unfathomable and fearsome as an impassable ocean, for the two sons of Vasudeva, the Lords of the universe, the battle was hardly more than play.**

### Translation

**For Him who orchestrates the creation, maintenance and destruction of the three worlds and who possesses unlimited spiritual qualities, it is hardly amazing that He subdues an opposing party. Still, when the Lord does so, imitating human behavior, sages glorify His acts.**

### Purport

The philosopher Aristotle once argued that the Supreme God would hardly take part in human activities, since all ordinary activities are unworthy of such a divine being. Similarly, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, who almost certainly never read the works of Aristotle, raises a similar point. Since Śrī Kṛṣṇa creates, maintains and annihilates the entire universe, isn’t it an uninteresting mismatch when He fights against Jarāsandha?

The answer is as follows: The Lord plays the part of a human being and, expanding His pleasure potency, creates thrilling transcendental pastimes full of suspense and dynamic action. By the Lord’s Yogamāyā potency, He appears exactly like a human being, and thus we may enjoy the spectacle of the Supreme Person acting on the earthly stage. Undoubtedly, stubborn agnostics will argue that since Kṛṣṇa is God, there is no real suspense involved. Such skeptics simply do not understand Kṛṣṇa’s attractive potency. Beauty and drama, even on the material stage, possess their own fascinating logic, and similarly we love Kṛṣṇa for His own sake, we appreciate His beauty for its own sake, and we enjoy Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes because they are in fact wonderful in and of themselves. In fact, Kṛṣṇa executes His pastimes not for a mundane egotistical purpose but for our pleasure. Thus the presentation of spiritual pastimes is itself an act of love that Kṛṣṇa performs for the infinite spiritual happiness of pure-hearted souls who have transcended material envy of the Godhead.

In this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes an important verse from the *Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad:* *narākṛti para-brahma kāraṇa-mānuṣaḥ.* “The Supreme Absolute Truth, for His own purpose, appears in a humanlike form, although He is the source of everything.” Similarly, in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.14.32) we find, *yan-mitraṁ paramānandaṁ pūrṇaṁ brahma sanātanam:* “The source of transcendental bliss, the eternal Supreme Brahman, has become their friend.”

### Translation

### Purport

The word *hatārātim* means “who has killed his enemies,” or “through whom his enemies would be killed.” Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has provided this thoughtful note.

On the road, however, several kings convinced him with both spiritual wisdom and mundane arguments that he should give up his idea of self-abnegation. They told him, “Your defeat by the Yadus was simply the unavoidable reaction of your past karma.”**

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that jeweled ornaments had also been collected from the horses and other animals. What might be added here, for the sake of the squeamish, is that Jarāsandha came to Mathurā with the clear intention of slaughtering every last man in the city, including Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. It is out of the causeless mercy of the Lord that He gives the conditioned souls a taste of their own medicine and thus helps them become more sensitive to the laws of nature and the existence of a Supreme Godhead. Ultimately, Kṛṣṇa awarded Jarāsandha and others killed on the battlefield spiritual liberation. The Lord is strict, but He is not malicious. In fact, He is an ocean of mercy.

Infuriated by their laughter, Gārgya set out for the south, thinking, ‘May I have a son who will bring terror to the Yādavas.’ He worshiped Lord Mahādeva, eating powdered iron, and after twelve years obtained his desired benediction. Elated, he returned home.

“Later, when the childless King of the Yavanas requested a son from him, Gārgya begot in the Yavana’s wife a son, Kālayavana. Kālayavana possessed the fury of Lord Śiva in his aspect as Mahākāla. Once, Kālayavana asked Nārada, ‘Who are now the strongest kings on earth?’ Nārada replied that the Yadus were. Thus sent by Nārada, Kālayavana appeared at Mathurā.”

The gateway towers were topped with golden turrets touching the sky, and their upper levels were fashioned of crystal quartz. The gold-covered houses were adorned in front with golden pots and on top with jeweled roofs, and their floors were inlaid with precious emeralds. Beside the houses stood treasury buildings, warehouses, and stables for fine horses, all built of silver and brass. Each residence had a watchtower, and also a temple for its household deity. Filled with citizens of all four social orders, the city was especially beautified by the palaces of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of the Yadus.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that the state highways (*rathyāḥ*) were in front and the secondary roads (*vīthyaḥ*) behind, and between them were courtyards (*catvarāṇi*). Within these courtyards were surrounding walls, and within the walls stood golden residences, atop which shone crystal watchtowers crowned with golden pots. Thus the buildings were multistoried. The word *vāstu* indicates that the houses and buildings were constructed on ample plots of land, with plenty of room for green areas.

haima-harmya-tale viṣṭā  
vismayaṁ paramaṁ yayuḥ*

“In the middle of the night, as the citizens of Mathurā slept, Lord Janārdana suddenly removed them from that city and placed them in Dvārakā. When the men awoke, they were all amazed to find themselves, their children and their wives sitting inside palaces made of gold.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Fiftieth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Kṛṣṇa Establishes the City of Dvārakā.”*
