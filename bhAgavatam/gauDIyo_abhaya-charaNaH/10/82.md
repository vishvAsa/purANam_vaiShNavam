CHAPTER EIGHTY-TWO

This chapter describes how the Yādavas and many other kings met at Kurukṣetra during a solar eclipse and discussed topics concerning Lord Kṛṣṇa. It also relates how Kṛṣṇa met Nanda Mahārāja and the other residents of Vṛndāvana at Kurukṣetra and gave them great joy.

Hearing that a total eclipse of the sun was soon to occur, people from all over Bhārata-varṣa, including the Yādavas, converged at Kurukṣetra to earn special pious credit. After the Yadus had bathed and performed other obligatory rituals, they noticed that kings of Matsya, Uśīnara and other places had also come, as well as Nanda Mahārāja and the cowherd community of Vraja, who were always feeling the intense anxiety of separation from Kṛṣṇa. The Yādavas, overjoyed to see all these old friends, embraced them one by one as they shed tears of happiness. Their wives also embraced one another with great pleasure.

When Queen Kuntī saw her brother Vasudeva and other members of her family, she put aside her sorrow. Yet still she said to Vasudeva, “O brother, I am so unfortunate, because all of you forgot me during my tribulations. Alas, even one’s relatives forget a person whom Providence no longer favors.”

Vasudeva replied, “My dear sister, everyone is merely a plaything of fate. We Yādavas were so harassed by Kaṁsa that we were forced to scatter and take shelter in foreign lands. So there was no way for us to keep in touch with you.”

The kings present were struck with wonder upon beholding Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His wives, and they began to glorify the Yādavas for having gotten the Lord’s personal association. Seeing Nanda Mahārāja, the Yādavas were delighted, and each of them embraced him tightly. Vasudeva also embraced Nanda with great joy and remembered how, when Vasudeva was tormented by Kaṁsa, Nanda had taken his sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, under his protection. Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa embraced and bowed down to mother Yaśodā, but Their throats choked up with emotion and they could say nothing to her. Nanda and Yaśodā lifted their two sons onto their laps and embraced Them, and in this way they relieved the distress of separation. Rohiṇī and Devakī both embraced Yaśodā and, remembering the great friendship she had shown them, told her that the kindness she had done by raising and supporting Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma could not be repaid even with the wealth of Indra.

Then the Supreme Lord approached the young cowherd girls in a secluded place. He consoled them by pointing out that He is all-pervasive, being the source of all energies, and thus He implied that they could never be separated from Him. Having been at long last reunited with Kṛṣṇa, the *gopīs* prayed simply to have His lotus feet manifested in their hearts.

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*athaikadā dvāravatyāṁ  
vasato rāma-kṛṣṇayoḥ  
sūryoparāgaḥ su-mahān  
āsīt kalpa-kṣaye yathā*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *atha* — then; *ekadā* — on one occasion; *dvāravatyām* — in Dvārakā; *vasatoḥ* — while They were living; *rāma*-*kṛṣṇayoḥ* — Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa; *sūrya* — of the sun; *uparāgaḥ* — an eclipse; *su*-*mahān* — very great; *āsīt* — there was; *kalpa* — of Lord Brahmā’s day; *kṣaye* — at the end; *yathā* — as if.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Once, while Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa were living in Dvārakā, there occurred a great eclipse of the sun, just as if the end of Lord Brahmā’s day had come.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out, the words *atha* and *ekadā* are commonly used in Sanskrit literature to introduce a new topic. Here they especially indicate that the reunion of the Yadus and Vṛṣṇis at Kurukṣetra is being narrated out of chronological sequence.

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī explains in his *Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* commentary that the events of this Eighty-second Chapter occur after Lord Baladeva’s visit to Vraja (Chapter 65) and before Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira’s Rājasūya sacrifice (Chapter 74). This must be so, the *ācārya* reasons, since during the eclipse at Kurukṣetra all the Kurus, including Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Yudhiṣṭhira, Bhīṣma and Droṇa, met in friendship and happily shared the company of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. At the Rājasūya-yajña, on the other hand, Duryodhana’s jealousy against the Pāṇḍavas became irrevocably inflamed. Soon after this, Duryodhana challenged Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers to the gambling match, in which he cheated them of their kingdom and exiled them to the forest. Right after the Pāṇḍavas’ return from exile, the great Battle of Kurukṣetra took place, during which Bhīṣma and Droṇa were killed. So it is not logically possible for the solar eclipse at Kurukṣetra to have happened after the Rājasūya sacrifice.

### Translation

**Knowing of this eclipse in advance, O King, many people went to the holy place known as Samanta-pañcaka in order to earn pious credit.**

### Purport

Vedic astronomers of five thousand years ago could predict eclipses of the sun and moon just as well as our modern astronomers can. The knowledge of the ancient astronomers went much further, however, since they understood the karmic influences of such events. Solar and lunar eclipses are generally very inauspicious, with certain rare exceptions. But just as the otherwise inauspicious Ekādaśī day becomes beneficial when used for the glorification of Lord Hari, so the time of an eclipse is also advantageous for fasting and worship.

The holy pilgrimage site known as Samanta-pañcaka is located at Kurukṣetra, the “sacred ground of the Kurus,” where the Kuru kings’ predecessors performed many Vedic sacrifices. The Kurus were thus advised by learned *brāhmaṇas* that this would be the best place for them to observe vows during the eclipse. Long before their time, Lord Paraśurāma had done penance at Kurukṣetra to atone for his killings. Samanta-pañcaka, the five ponds he dug there, were still present at the end of Dvāpara-yuga, as they are even today.

### Translation

**After ridding the earth of kings, Lord Paraśurāma, the foremost of warriors, created huge lakes from the kings’ blood at Samantaka-pañcaka. Although he is never tainted by karmic reactions, Lord Paraśurāma performed sacrifices there to instruct people in general; thus he acted like an ordinary person trying to free himself of sins. From all parts of Bhārata-varṣa a great number of people now came to that Samanta-pañcaka on pilgrimage. O descendant of Bharata, among those arriving at the holy place were many Vṛṣṇis, such as Gada, Pradyumna and Sāmba, hoping to be relieved of their sins; Akrūra, Vasudeva, Āhuka and other kings also went there. Aniruddha remained in Dvārakā with Sucandra, Śuka and Sāraṇa to guard the city, together with Kṛtavarmā, the commander of their armed forces.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s grandson Aniruddha remained in Dvārakā to protect the city because He is originally Lord Viṣṇu’s manifestation as the guardian of the spiritual planet Śvetadvīpa.

Also with them were many infantrymen as effulgent as celestial Vidyādharas. The Yādavas were so divinely dressed — being adorned with gold necklaces and flower garlands and wearing fine armor — that as they proceeded along the road with their wives they seemed to be demigods flying through the sky.**

These are the special dealings of Vaiṣṇavas. Even the family entanglements that delude ordinary conditioned souls are no encumbrance for those whose family members are all pure devotees of the Lord. Impersonalists have no capacity for appreciating these intimate dealings, since their philosophy condemns as illusory any kind of personal, emotional existence. When followers of impersonalism pretend to understand the loving relationships of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, they only create havoc for themselves and whoever listens to them.

**Queen Kuntī met with her brothers and sisters and their children, and also with her parents, her brothers’ wives and Lord Mukunda. While talking with them she forgot her sorrow.**

### Purport

Even the constant anxiety of a pure devotee, apparently just the opposite of the impersonalists’ *śānti,* can be an exalted manifestation of love of God, as exemplified by Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī, the aunt of Lord Kṛṣṇa and mother of the Pāṇḍavas.

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura both comment that Kuntī does not blame her relatives for her suffering. Thus she calls them “most saintly persons” and alludes here to her own bad fortune as the cause of her unhappiness.

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, all these kings were now followers of Yudhiṣṭhira because he had subjugated each of them to earn the privilege of performing the Rājasūya sacrifice. The Vedic injunctions state that a *kṣatriya* who wants to execute the Rājasūya for elevation to heaven must first send out a “victory horse” to roam freely; any other king whose territory this horse enters must either voluntarily submit or face the *kṣatriya* or his representatives in battle.

### Translation

**His fame, as broadcast by the Vedas, the water that has washed His feet, and the words He speaks in the form of the revealed scriptures — these thoroughly purify this universe. Although the earth’s good fortune was ravaged by time, the touch of His lotus feet has revitalized her, and thus she is raining down on us the fulfillment of all our desires. The same Lord Viṣṇu who makes one forget the goals of heaven and liberation has now entered into marital and blood relationships with you, who otherwise travel on the hellish path of family life. Indeed, in these relationships you see and touch Him directly, walk beside Him, converse with Him, and together with Him lie down to rest, sit at ease and take your meals.**

### Purport

All Vedic *mantras* glorify Lord Viṣṇu; this truth is supported with elaborate evidence by learned *ācāryas* like Rāmānuja, in his *Vedārtha-saṅgraha,* and Madhva, in his *Ṛg-veda-bhāṣya.* The words Viṣṇu Himself speaks, such as the *Bhagavad-gītā,* are the confidential essence of all scripture. In His manifestation as Vyāsadeva, the Supreme Lord composed both the *Vedānta-sutras* and *Mahābhārata,* and this *Mahābhārata* includes Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s personal statement: *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo/ vedānta-kṛd veda-vid eva cāham.* “By all the *Vedas,* I am to be known. Indeed, I am the compiler of *Vedānta,* and I am the knower of the *Vedas.*” (*Bhagavad-gītā* 15.15)

When Lord Viṣṇu appeared before Bali Mahārāja to beg three steps of land, the Lord’s second step pierced the shells of the universe. The water of the transcendental river Virajā, lying just outside the universal egg, thus seeped inside, washing Lord Vāmana’s foot and flowing down to become the Ganges River. Because of the sanctity of its origin, the Ganges is generally considered the most holy of rivers. But even more potent is the water of the Yamunā, where Lord Viṣṇu in His original form of Govinda played with His intimate companions.

In these two verses the assembled kings praise the special merit of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s Yadu clan. Not only do they see Kṛṣṇa, but they are also directly connected with Him by dual bonds of marital and blood relationships. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī suggests that the word *bandha,* beside its more obvious meaning of “relation,” can also be understood in the sense of “capture,” expressing that the love the Yadus feel for the Lord obliges Him always to stay with them.

Following them inside were Rohiṇī, other women and men of Vraja, and a number of attendants. Inside, Nanda and Yaśodā took the two boys on their laps. Despite having heard the glories of the two Lords of Dvārakā, and despite seeing these opulences now before their eyes, Nanda and Yaśodā looked upon Them as if They were still their eight-year-old children.

They were never afraid, good lady, because you protected Them just as eyelids protect the eyes. Indeed, saintly persons like you never discriminate between outsiders and their own kin.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had not seen Their parents for two reasons: because of Their exile in Vraja, and also because They are never actually born and therefore have no parents.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also describes what Devakī thought before speaking this verse: “Alas, because for so long these two sons of mine had you, Yaśodā, as Their guardian and mother, and because They were immersed in such a vast ocean of ecstatic loving dealings with you, now that you are once more before Them They are too distracted to even notice me. Also, you are behaving as if insane and blind with love for Them, showing millions of times more maternal affection than I possess. Thus you simply keep staring at us, your friends, without recognizing us. So let me bring you back to reality on the pretext of some affectionate words.”

Then, when Devakī failed to get any response from Yaśodā even after addressing her, Rohiṇī said, “My dear Devakī, it’s impossible just now to rouse her out of this ecstatic trance. We are crying in the wilderness, and her two sons are no less bound up in the ropes of affection for her than she is for Them. So let us now go outside to meet with Pṛthā, Draupadī and the others.”

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *gopyaḥ* — the young cowherd women; *ca* — and; *kṛṣṇam* — Kṛṣṇa; *upalabhya* — sighting; *cirāt* — after a long time; *abhīṣṭam* — their object of desire; *yat* — whom; *prekṣaṇe* — while seeing; *dṛśiṣu* — on their eyes; *pakṣma* — of lids; *kṛtam* — the maker; *śapanti* — they would curse; *dṛgbhiḥ* — with their eyes; *hṛdī*-*kṛtam* — taken into their hearts; *alam* — to their satisfaction; *parirabhya* — embracing; *sarvāḥ* — all of them; *tat* — in Him; *bhāvam* — ecstatic absorption; *āpuḥ* — attained; *api* — even though; *nitya* — constantly; *yujām* — for those who engage in yogic discipline; *durāpam* — difficult to attain.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: While gazing at their beloved Kṛṣṇa, the young gopīs used to condemn the creator of their eyelids, \[which would momentarily block their vision of Him\]. Now, seeing Kṛṣṇa again after such a long separation, with their eyes they took Him into their hearts, and there they embraced Him to their full satisfaction. In this way they became totally absorbed in ecstatic meditation on Him, although those who constantly practice mystic yoga find such absorption difficult to achieve.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, just then Lord Balarāma saw the *gopīs* standing a short distance away. Seeing them trembling with eagerness to meet Kṛṣṇa, and apparently ready to give up their lives if they could not, He tactfully decided to get up and involve Himself elsewhere. Then the *gopīs* attained the state described in the current verse. In referring to the *gopīs’* intolerant disrespect of Lord Brahmā, “the creator of eyelids,” Śukadeva Gosvāmī is giving vent to his own subtle jealousy of the *gopīs’* favored position.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī offers an alternate understanding of the phrase *nitya-yujām,* which may mean “even of the Lord’s principal queens, who tend to be proud of their constant association with Him.”

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “Because they had been separated from Kṛṣṇa for so many years, the *gopīs,* having come along with Nanda Mahārāja and mother Yaśodā, felt intense ecstasy in seeing Kṛṣṇa. No one can even imagine how anxious the *gopīs* were to see Kṛṣṇa again. As soon as Kṛṣṇa became visible to them, they took Him inside their hearts through their eyes and embraced Him to their full satisfaction. Even though they were embracing Kṛṣṇa only mentally, they became so ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy that for the time being they completely forgot themselves. The ecstatic trance which they achieved simply by mentally embracing Kṛṣṇa is impossible to achieve even for great *yogīs* constantly engaged in meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa could understand that the *gopīs* were rapt in ecstasy by embracing Him in their minds, and therefore, since He is present in everyone’s heart, He also reciprocated the embracing from within.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself by His *vibhūti-śakti* to embrace each of the *gopīs* individually, thus waking each of them from her trance. He inquired, “Are you now relieved of your pain of separation?” and laughed to help lighten their spirits.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī reveals the *gopīs’* thoughts: “We are not like You, who, with Your heart shattered by remembering us day and night, gave up all sense enjoyment in Your distress of separation. Rather, we have not remembered You at all; in fact, we have been quite happy without You.” In response, Kṛṣṇa here asks whether they resent His ingratitude.

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī and Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Lord Kṛṣṇa implies the following idea in this verse: “If you know that I am the Supreme Lord, there should be no question of your suffering any separation from Me, since I pervade all existence. Your unhappiness must be due to a lack of discrimination. Therefore please take this instruction from Me, which will remove your ignorance.

“But the truth of the matter is that you *gopīs* were in your previous lives great masters of *yoga,* and thus you must already know this science of *jñāna-yoga.* Furthermore, whether I try to teach this to you in person or through My representative, such as Uddhava, it will not produce the desired result. *Jñāna-yoga* simply causes suffering for those who are fully immersed in pure love of Godhead.”

*evam* — in this manner; *hi* — indeed; *etāni* — these; *bhūtāni* — material entities; *bhūteṣu* — within the elements of creation; *ātmā* — the self; *ātmanā* — in its own true identity; *tataḥ* — pervasive; *ubhayam* — both; *mayi* — within Me; *atha* — that is to say; *pare* — within the Supreme Truth; *paśyata* — you should see; *ābhātam* — manifested; *akṣare* — within the imperishable.

### Translation

**In this way all created things reside within the basic elements of creation, while the spirit souls pervade the creation, remaining in their own true identity. You should see both of these — the material creation and the self — as manifest within Me, the imperishable Supreme Truth.**

### Purport

One should properly understand the relationships among the material objects of this world, the elements comprising their basic substance, the individual spirit souls and the one Supreme Soul. The various objects of material enjoyment, such as pots, rivers and mountains, are manufactured from the basic material elements — earth, water, fire and so on. These elements pervade material things as their cause, while the spirit souls pervade them in their special role as their enjoyer (*svātmanā*). And ultimately, the material elements, their products and the living entities are all manifested within and pervaded by the imperishable, perfectly complete Supreme Soul, Kṛṣṇa.

A *jñānī* with realization of these facts should feel no separation from the Lord in any situation, but the *gopīs* of Vraja are much more elevated in their Kṛṣṇa consciousness than ordinary *jñānīs.* Because of their intense love for Kṛṣṇa in His most humanlike, all-attractive aspect as a young cowherd boy, Kṛṣṇa’s internal potency, Yoga-māyā, covered their knowledge of His majestic aspects, such as His all-pervasiveness. Thus the *gopīs* were able to relish the intense ecstasy caused by their love in separation from Him. Only in jest is Śrī Kṛṣṇa ascribing to them a lack of spiritual discrimination.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Having thus been instructed by Kṛṣṇa in spiritual matters, the gopīs were freed of all tinges of false ego because of their incessant meditation upon Him. And with their deepening absorption in Him, they came to understand Him fully.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda renders this passage as follows in *Kṛṣṇa:* “The *gopīs,* having been instructed by Kṛṣṇa in this philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference, remained always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus became liberated from all material contamination. The consciousness of the living entity who falsely presents himself as the enjoyer of the material world is called *jīva-kośa,* which means imprisonment by the false ego. Not only the *gopīs* but anyone who follows these instructions of Kṛṣṇa becomes immediately freed from the *jīva-kośa* imprisonment. A person in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness is always liberated from false egoism; he utilizes everything for Kṛṣṇa’s service and is not at any time separated from Kṛṣṇa.”

### Translation

**The gopīs spoke thus: Dear Lord, whose navel is just like a lotus flower, Your lotus feet are the only shelter for those who have fallen into the deep well of material existence. Your feet are worshiped and meditated upon by great mystic yogīs and highly learned philosophers. We wish that these lotus feet may also be awakened within our hearts, although we are only ordinary persons engaged in household affairs.**

### Purport

The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 1.81), where this verse is quoted.

Revealing the jealous mood in which the *gopīs* spoke these deceptively reverential words, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives their statements as follows: “O Supreme Lord, O directly manifest Supersoul, O crest jewel of instructors in definitive knowledge, You were aware of our excessive attachment to home, property and family. Therefore You previously had Uddhava instruct us in the knowledge that dispels ignorance, and now You have done so Yourself. In this way You have purified our hearts of contamination, and as a result we understand Your pure love for us, free from any motivation other than assuring our liberation. But we are only unintelligent cowherd women; how can this knowledge remain fixed in our hearts? We cannot even meditate steadily on Your feet, the focus of realization for great souls like Lord Brahmā. Please be merciful to us and somehow make it possible for us to concentrate on You, even a little. We are still suffering the reactions of our own fruitive work, so how can we meditate on You, the goal of great *yogīs*? Such *yogīs* are immeasurably wise, but we are mere feeble-minded women. Please do something to get us out of this deep well of material life.”

Pure devotees are never motivated by a desire for material elevation or spiritual liberation. And even if the Lord offers them such benedictions, the devotees often refuse to accept them. As stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.20.34):

*na kiñcit sādhavo dhīrā  
bhaktā hy ekāntino mama  
vāñchanty api mayā dattaṁ  
kaivalyam apunar-bhavam*

“Because My devotees possess saintly behavior and deep intelligence, they completely dedicate themselves to Me and do not desire anything besides Me. Indeed, even if I offer them liberation from birth and death, they do not accept it.” It is quite appropriate, therefore, that the *gopīs* respond with a trace of jealous anger to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s attempt at teaching them *jñāna-yoga.*

Thus, according to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the words the *gopīs* speak in this verse may be interpreted as follows: “O sun who directly destroys the darkness of ignorance, we are scorched by the sun-rays of this philosophical knowledge. We are *cakora* birds who can subsist only on the moonlight radiating from Your beautiful face. Please come back to Vṛndāvana with us, and in this way bring us back to life.”

And if He says, “Then come to Dvārakā; there we will enjoy together,” they reply that Śrī Vṛndāvana is their home, and they are too attached to it for them to take up residence anywhere else. Only there, the *gopīs* imply, can Kṛṣṇa attract them by wearing peacock feathers in His turban and playing enchanting music with His flute. Only by His appearing again in Vṛndāvana can the *gopīs* be saved, not by any other kind of meditation on Him or theoretical knowledge of the self.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Eighty-second Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma Meet the Inhabitants of Vṛndāvana.”*
