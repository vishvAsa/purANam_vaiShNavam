CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO

This chapter describes how Śrī Kṛṣṇa manifested Himself in the midst of the *gopīs,* who had become extremely disturbed by their separation from Him. After He consoled them, they expressed to Him their deep feelings of ecstasy.

The *gopīs* having shown in various ways their great eagerness to see Kṛṣṇa, the attractor of Cupid, He appeared before them wearing silken yellow garments and a beautiful flower garland. Some of the *gopīs,* overwhelmed with ecstasy at seeing Him, grasped His hands, others placed His arm on their shoulders, and others accepted the remnants of betel nut He had chewed. Thus they served Him.

One *gopī,* impelled by loving anger toward Kṛṣṇa, bit her lip and looked askance at Him. Because the *gopīs* were so attached to Kṛṣṇa, they were not satiated even by continuously gazing at Him. One of them then placed Kṛṣṇa within her heart, closed her eyes and, embracing Him within herself again and again, became absorbed in transcendental bliss, just like a *yogī.* In this way the pain the *gopīs* had felt because of separation from the Lord was dispelled.

Next Lord Kṛṣṇa went to the bank of the Yamunā in the company of the cowherd girls, His internal potencies. The *gopīs* then made a seat for Kṛṣṇa out of their shawls, and after He had sat down they enjoyed with Him by gesturing amorously. The *gopīs* still felt hurt that Kṛṣṇa had disappeared, so He explained to them why He had done so. He further told them that He had come under the exclusive control of their loving devotion and would ever remain indebted to them.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that the analogy given here of saintly persons meditating upon the Lord’s feet is only partially applicable, since the ecstasy the *gopīs* felt when Kṛṣṇa came back was actually unparalleled. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also reveals that this particular *gopī* is the most fortunate of all, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura states that the seven *gopīs* mentioned so far in this chapter are the first seven of the eight principal *gopīs,* whose status allowed them to immediately approach Śrī Kṛṣṇa upon His reappearance. The *ācārya* quotes a verse from the *Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* that gives the names of these seven as Candrāvalī, Śyāmalā, Śaibyā, Padmā, Śrī Rādhā, Lalitā and Viśākhā. The eighth is understood to be Bhadrā. *Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* itself quotes a verse from the *Skanda Purāṇa* that declares these eight *gopīs* to be the principal among the three billion *gopīs.* Detailed information about the hierarchy of *gopīs* is available in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s *Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi.*

The *Padma Purāṇa* confirms that Śrī Rādhā is the foremost of the *gopīs:*

*yathā rādhā priyā viṣṇos  
tasyāḥ kuṇḍaṁ priyaṁ tathā  
sarva-gopīṣu saivaikā  
viṣṇor atyanta-vallabhā*

“Just as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is most dear to Kṛṣṇa, Her bathing pond is similarly dear. Of all the *gopīs,* She is the most beloved of the Lord.”

The *Bṛhad-gautamīya-tantra* also names Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī as Kṛṣṇa’s foremost consort:

*devī kṛṣṇa-mayī proktā  
rādhikā para-devatā  
sarva-lakṣmī-mayī sarva  
kāntiḥ sammohinī parā*

“The transcendental goddess Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the direct counterpart of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She is the central figure for all the goddesses of fortune. She possesses all attractiveness to attract the all-attractive Personality of Godhead. She is the primeval internal potency of the Lord.” (This translation is Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* *Ādi* 4.83.)

Additional information about Śrī Rādhā is given in the *Ṛg-pariśiṣṭa* (the supplement to the *Ṛg Veda*): *rādhayā mādhavo devo mādhavenaiva rādhikā/* *vibhrājante janeṣu.* “Among all persons, it is Śrī Rādhā in whose company Lord Mādhava is especially glorious, as She is especially glorious in His.”

### Purport

The *gopīs* are Lord Kṛṣṇa’s internal potency, and therefore when they were relieved and happy again the Lord shone forth even more brilliantly than before, and His transcendental bliss increased. Kṛṣṇa loves the *gopīs* with pure transcendental love, and they love Him in the same pure way. The whole affair, conducted on the transcendental platform, is inconceivable to those bound in material existence.

### Translation

**Their heartache vanquished by the ecstasy of seeing Kṛṣṇa, the gopīs, like the personified Vedas before them, felt their desires completely fulfilled. For their dear friend Kṛṣṇa they arranged a seat with their shawls which were smeared with the kuṅkuma powder from their breasts.**

### Purport

In the Eighty-seventh Chapter of this canto (text 23), the *śrutis,* or personified *Vedas,* pray as follows:

*striya uragendra-bhoga-bhuja-daṇḍa-viṣakta-dhiyo  
vayam api te samāḥ samadṛśo ’ṅghri-saroja-sudhāḥ*

“These women fully absorbed their minds in meditation on Lord Kṛṣṇa’s powerful arms, which are like the bodies of great serpents. We want to become just like the *gopīs* and render service to His lotus feet.” The *śrutis* had seen Kṛṣṇa during His appearance in the previous day of Brahmā and had become full of the most intense desire to associate with Him. Then in this *kalpa* they became *gopīs.* And since the *Vedas* are eternal in human society, the *śrutis* in this *kalpa* also become full of desire for Kṛṣṇa and in the next *kalpa* will also become *gopīs.* This information is given by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.

### Purport

The masters of mystic meditation include Lord Śiva, Ananta Śeṣa and other exalted personalities, all of whom keep the Lord seated within the lotus of their hearts. This same Lord, conquered by the intense, selfless love of the *gopīs,* agreed to become their boyfriend and dance with them in Vṛndāvana, after sitting upon their fragrant shawls on the bank of the Yamunā River.

**The gopīs said: Some people reciprocate the affection only of those who are affectionate toward them, while others show affection even to those who are indifferent or inimical. And yet others will not show affection toward anyone. Dear Kṛṣṇa, please properly explain this matter to us.**

### Purport

By this apparently polite question, the *gopīs* want to expose Lord Kṛṣṇa’s failure to properly reciprocate their love. They were very disturbed when Śrī Kṛṣṇa left them in the forest, and they want to know why He caused them to suffer in these loving affairs.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: So-called friends who show affection for each other only to benefit themselves are actually selfish. They have no true friendship, nor are they following the true principles of religion. Indeed, if they did not expect benefit for themselves, they would not reciprocate.**

### Purport

The Lord here reminds the *gopīs* that in pure loving friendship there is no sense of selfish interest but rather only love for one’s friend.

akṛta-jñā guru-druhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*bhajataḥ* — with those who are acting favorably; *api* — even; *na* — not; *vai* — certainly; *kecit* — some; *bhajanti* — reciprocate; *abhajataḥ* — with those who are not acting favorably; *kutaḥ* — what to speak of; *ātma*-*ārāmāḥ* — the self-satisfied; *hi* — indeed; *āpta*-*kāmāḥ* — those who have already attained their material desires; *akṛta*-*jñāḥ* — those who are ungrateful; *guru*-*druhaḥ* — those who are inimical to superiors.

### Translation

**Then there are those individuals who are spiritually self-satisfied, materially fulfilled or by nature ungrateful or simply envious of superiors. Such persons will not love even those who love them, what to speak of those who are inimical.**

### Purport

Some people, being spiritually self-satisfied, do not reciprocate others’ affection because they want to avoid entanglement in mundane dealings. Other persons do not reciprocate simply out of envy or arrogance. And still others fail to reciprocate because they are materially satisfied and thus uninterested in new material opportunities. Lord Kṛṣṇa patiently explains all these things to the *gopīs.*

नाहं तु सख्यो भजतोऽपि जन्तून्  
भजाम्यमीषामनुवृत्तिवृत्तये ।  
यथाधनो लब्धधने विनष्टे  
तच्चिन्तयान्यन्निभृतो न वेद ॥ २० ॥

### Verse text

*nāhaṁ tu sakhyo bhajato ’pi jantūn  
bhajāmy amīṣām anuvṛtti-vṛttaye  
yathādhano labdha-dhane vinaṣṭe  
tac-cintayānyan nibhṛto na veda*

### Synonyms

*na* — do not; *aham* — I; *tu* — on the other hand; *sakhyaḥ* — O friends; *bhajataḥ* — worshiping; *api* — even; *jantūn* — with living beings; *bhajāmi* — reciprocate; *amīṣām* — their; *anuvṛtti* — propensity (for pure love); *vṛttaye* — in order to impel; *yathā* — just as; *adhanaḥ* — a poor man; *labdha* — having obtained; *dhane* — wealth; *vinaṣṭe* — and it being lost; *tat* — of that; *cintayā* — with anxious thought; *anyat* — anything else; *nibhṛtaḥ* — filled; *na* *veda* — does not know.

### Translation

**But the reason I do not immediately reciprocate the affection of living beings even when they worship Me, O gopīs, is that I want to intensify their loving devotion. They then become like a poor man who has gained some wealth and then lost it, and who thus becomes so anxious about it that he can think of nothing else.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa states in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham:* “As people approach Me, I reciprocate with them accordingly.” Yet even if the Lord is approached by someone with devotion, to intensify the devotee’s love the Lord may not immediately reciprocate fully. In fact, the Lord *is* truly reciprocating. After all, a sincere devotee always prays to the Lord, “Please help me to love You purely.” Therefore the Lord’s so-called neglect is actually the fulfillment of the devotee’s prayer. Lord Kṛṣṇa intensifies our love for Him by apparently separating Himself from us, and the result is that we achieve what we really wanted and prayed for: intense love for the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa’s apparent negligence is actually His thoughtful reciprocation and the fulfillment of our deepest and purest desire.

According to the *ācāryas,* as Lord Kṛṣṇa began to speak this verse the *gopīs* looked at one another with squinting eyes, trying to hide the smiles breaking out on their faces. Even as Lord Kṛṣṇa was speaking, the *gopīs* had begun to realize that He was bringing them to the highest perfection of loving service.

### Purport

Here the Lord indicates that though the *gopīs* were already perfect in their love for Him, still, to inconceivably increase their perfection and show an example for the world, He acted as He did.

### Purport

The translation and word meanings for this verse are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Śrī* *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 4.180).

In conclusion, the *gopīs* became eternally glorious by their behavior in the Lord’s temporary absence, and the mutual love between them and the Lord was wonderfully enhanced. This is the perfection of Kṛṣṇa and His loving devotees.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Thirty-second Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Reunion.”*
