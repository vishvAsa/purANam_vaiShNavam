CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT

In this chapter Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa first visits Trivakrā (also known as Kubjā) and enjoys with her, and then He visits Akrūra. The Lord sends Akrūra to Hastināpura to satisfy the Pāṇḍavas.

After Uddhava had related to Śrī Kṛṣṇa the news of Vraja, the Lord went to the home of Trivakrā, which was decorated with diverse ornamentation conducive to sexual enjoyment. Trivakrā welcomed Kṛṣṇa with great respect, giving Him a raised seat and, together with her female companions, worshiping Him. She also offered Uddhava a seat, as befitted his position, but Uddhava simply touched the seat and sat on the floor.

Lord Kṛṣṇa then reclined on an opulent bed as the maidservant Trivakrā elaborately washed and decorated herself. Then she approached Him. Kṛṣṇa invited Trivakrā to the bed and began to enjoy with her in various ways. By embracing Lord Kṛṣṇa, Trivakrā freed herself of the torment of lust. She asked Kṛṣṇa to remain with her for some time, and the considerate Lord promised to fulfill her request in due course. He then returned with Uddhava to His residence. Apart from offering sandal paste to Kṛṣṇa, Trivakrā had never performed any pious acts, yet simply on the strength of the piety of this single act she attained the rare personal association of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa next went to Akrūra’s house with Lord Baladeva and Uddhava. Akrūra honored the three of them by bowing down and presenting them with suitable sitting places. Then he worshiped Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, washed Their feet and poured the water on his head. Akrūra also offered Them many prayers.

Lord Kṛṣṇa was pleased with Akrūra’s prayers. He told him that since he, Akrūra, was in fact Their paternal uncle, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma should be the recipients of his protection and mercy. Lord Kṛṣṇa then praised Akrūra as a saint and purifier of the sinful, and He asked him to visit Hastināpura to find out how the Pāṇḍavas, deprived of their father, were faring. Finally, the Lord returned home, taking Balarāma and Uddhava with Him.

श्रीशुक उवाच  
अथ विज्ञाय भगवान् सर्वात्मा सर्वदर्शन- ।  
सैरन्ध्र‍या- कामतप्ताया- प्रियमिच्छन् गृहं ययौ ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*atha vijñāya bhagavān  
sarvātmā sarva-darśanaḥ  
sairandhryāḥ kāma-taptāyāḥ  
priyam icchan gṛhaṁ yayau*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *atha* — then; *vijñāya* — understanding; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Lord; *sarva* — of all; *ātmā* — the Soul; *sarva* — of everything; *darśanaḥ* — the seer; *sairandhryāḥ* — of the serving girl, Trivakrā; *kāma* — by lust; *taptāyāḥ* — troubled; *priyam* — the satisfaction; *icchan* — wanting; *gṛham* — to her house; *yayau* — He went.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Next, after assimilating Uddhava’s report, Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the omniscient Soul of all that be, desired to satisfy the serving girl Trivakrā, who was troubled by lust. Thus He went to her house.**

### Purport

This text gives an interesting insight into the Lord’s pastimes. The first line says, *atha vijñnāya bhagavān:* “Thus the Lord, understanding \[Uddhava’s report\], …” The second line states that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Soul of everything (*sarvātmā*) and the seer of everything (*sarva-darśanaḥ*). In other words, although He certainly does not depend on spoken reports from messengers, He plays the part of a human being and listens to news from a messenger — not out of need, as we would do, but in the bliss of His spiritual pastimes, exchanging love with His pure devotee. The word *sarva-darśanaḥ* also indicates that the Lord perfectly understood the feelings of the residents of Vraja and was perfectly reciprocating with them within their hearts. Now, in His external pastimes, He desired to bless Śrīmatī Trivakrā, who was about to be freed from the disease of material lust.

There were banners, rows of strung pearls, canopies, fine beds and sitting places, and also fragrant incense, oil lamps, flower garlands and aromatic sandalwood paste.**

### Purport

According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, the sensual accoutrements in Trivakrā’s house included explicit sexual pictures. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that her paraphernalia included herbal aphrodisiacs. It is not hard to guess Trivakrā’s intention, yet Lord Kṛṣṇa went there to save her from material existence.

### Translation

**Uddhava also received a seat of honor, since he was a saintly person, but he simply touched it and sat on the floor. Then Lord Kṛṣṇa, imitating the manners of human society, quickly made Himself comfortable on an opulent bed.**

### Purport

According to the *ācāryas,* Uddhava felt reverence for his Lord and thus declined to sit on an opulent seat in His presence; rather, he touched the seat with his hand and sat on the floor. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that Lord Kṛṣṇa made Himself comfortable on a bed located in the inner chambers of Trivakrā’s home.

### Translation

**Calling forward His beloved, who was anxious and shy at the prospect of this new contact, the Lord pulled her by her bangled hands onto the bed. Thus He enjoyed with that beautiful girl, whose only trace of piety was her having offered ointment to the Lord.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the words *nava-saṅgama-hriyā* indicate that Trivakrā was in fact a virgin girl at this point. She had been a deformed hunchback, and the Lord had recently transformed her into a beautiful girl. Therefore, although clearly lusting after Śrī Kṛṣṇa, she was naturally shy and anxious.

*saivaṁ kaivalya-nāthaṁ taṁ

### Synonyms

*sa* — she; *evam* — thus; *kaivalya* — of liberation; *nātham* — the controller; *tam* — Him; *prāpya* — obtaining; *duṣprāpyam* — unobtainable; *īśvaram* — the Supreme Lord; *aṅga*-*rāga* — body ointment; *arpaṇena* — by offering; *aho* — oh; *durbhagā* — unfortunate; *idam* — this; *ayācata* — she begged.

### Translation

**Having thus gotten the hard-to-get Supreme Lord by the simple act of offering Him body ointment, unfortunate Trivakrā submitted to that Lord of freedom the following request.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Śrīmatī Trivakrā prayed to the Lord, “Please enjoy only with me, and not with any other woman.” Because Kṛṣṇa was not prepared to grant such a benediction, Trivakrā is described here as unfortunate. Śrīdhara Svāmī adds that although to ordinary eyes she seemed to beg for material sex pleasure, in fact she was a liberated soul at this point.

### Synonyms

*saha* — together; *uṣyatām* — please stay; *iha* — here; *preṣṭha* — O beloved; *dināni* — days; *katicit* — some; *mayā* — with me; *ramasva* — please take pleasure; *na* *utsahe* — I cannot tolerate; *tyaktum* — giving up; *saṅgam* — association; *te* — Your; *amburuha*-*īkṣaṇa* — O lotus-eyed one.

### Translation

**\[Trivakrā said:\] O beloved, please stay here with me for a few days more and enjoy. I cannot bear to give up Your association, O lotus-eyed one!**

### Purport

The word *ambu* means “water,” and *ruha* means “rising.” Thus *amburuha* means “the lotus flower, which rises up from the water.” Lord Kṛṣṇa is called *amburuhekṣaṇa,* “the lotus-eyed one.” He is the source and embodiment of all beauty, and naturally Trivakrā was attracted to Him. However, the Lord’s beauty is spiritual and pure, and His intention was not to gratify Himself with Trivakrā but rather to bring her to the point of pure spiritual existence, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**Promising her the fulfillment of this lusty desire, considerate Kṛṣṇa, Lord of all beings, paid Trivakrā His respects and then returned with Uddhava to His own supremely opulent residence.**

### Purport

All the *ācāryas* agree that the words *kāma-varaṁ dattvā* indicate that Lord Kṛṣṇa promised Trivakrā He would fulfill her lusty desires.

*durārdhyaṁ samārādhya  
viṣṇuṁ sarveśvareśvaram  
yo vṛṇīte mano-grāhyam  
asattvāt kumanīṣy asau*

### Synonyms

*durārādhyam* — rarely worshiped; *samārādhya* — fully worshiping; *viṣṇum* — Lord Viṣṇu; *sarva* — of all; *īśvara* — controllers; *īśvaram* — the supreme controller; *yaḥ* — who; *vṛṇīte* — chooses as a benediction; *manaḥ* — to the mind; *grāhyam* — that which is accessible, namely sense gratification; *asattvāt* — because of its insignificance; *kumanīṣī* — unintelligent; *asau* — that person.

### Translation

**Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord of all lords, is ordinarily difficult to approach. One who has properly worshiped Him and then chooses the benediction of mundane sense gratification is certainly of poor intelligence, for he is satisfied with an insignificant result.**

### Purport

It is clear from the commentaries of the *ācāryas* that the story of Trivakrā is to be understood on two levels. On the one hand, she is understood to be a liberated soul, directly associating with the Lord and participating in His pastimes. On the other hand, her conduct is clearly meant to teach a lesson about what not to do in relation with Lord Kṛṣṇa. Since all of the Lord’s pastimes are not only blissful but also didactic, there is no real contradiction in this pastime, since Trivakrā’s purity and her bad example take place on two distinct levels. Arjuna is also considered a pure devotee, yet by initially disobeying Kṛṣṇa’s instruction to fight, he also showed an example of what not to do. However, such “bad examples” always have happy endings in the blissful association of the Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

The previous incident of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s visit to Trivakrā’s house, and now His visit to Akrūra’s, gives a fascinating glimpse into the daily activities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in Mathurā City.

After embracing them and greeting them, Akrūra bowed down to Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma and was greeted by Them in return. Then, when his guests had taken their seats, he worshiped them in accordance with scriptural rules.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the others approached Akrūra in a friendly attitude. At first Akrūra reciprocated that friendly mood, and then, in the course of showing them hospitality, he adopted his natural devotional attitude toward the Lord and thus offered his obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Balarāma.

After praising Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma for having saved Their dynasty, Akrūra now points out that the Lord actually has no mundane connection with any social or political institution. He is the original Personality of Godhead, performing His pastimes for the benefit of the entire universe.

आत्मसृष्टमिदं विश्वमन्वाविश्य स्वशक्तिभि- ।

### Verse text

*ātma-sṛṣṭam idaṁ viśvam  
anvāviśya sva-śaktibhiḥ  
īyate bahudhā brahman  
śruta-pratyakṣa-gocaram*

### Synonyms

*ātma*-*sṛṣṭam* — created by You; *idam* — this; *viśvam* — universe; *anvāviśya* — subsequently entering; *sva* — with Your own; *śaktibhiḥ* — energies; *īyate* — You are perceived; *bahudhā* — manifold; *brahman* — O Supreme; *śruta* — by hearing from scripture; *pratyakṣa* — and by direct perception; *gocaram* — knowable.

### Translation

**O Supreme Absolute Truth, with Your personal energies You create this universe and then enter into it. Thus one can perceive You in many different forms by hearing from authorities and by direct experience.**

### Purport

The grammatical agreement of *śruta-pratyakṣa-gocaram,* in the neuter case, with *ātma-sṛṣṭam idaṁ viśvam* indicates that the Supreme Lord, by entering His creation with His potencies, makes Himself perceivable within the universe. Throughout the *Bhāgavatam* and other authorized Vedic literature, we often find descriptions of the Lord’s simultaneous supremacy over all other things and His identity with them. We cannot reasonably draw any other conclusion from Vedic literature than the one powerfully preached by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.* That is, the Absolute Truth is greater than and distinct from everything (since He is the omnipotent creator and controller of all), and simultaneously one with everything (since all that exists is the expansion of His own power).

Throughout these chapters of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* we also observe one of the unique, extraordinary features of this great work. Whether Kṛṣṇa is sending His message to the *gopīs* or accepting the prayers of Akrūra, there is constant philosophical discussion. Throughout the *Bhāgavatam,* the steady combination of fascinating pastimes with persistent spiritual philosophy is an extraordinary feature. We are allowed to glimpse and even to relish the spiritual emotions of the Lord and His liberated associates, and yet we are constantly reminded of their ontological position lest we lapse into a cheap, anthropomorphic vision. Thus it is entirely in character with the work that Akrūra, in his ecstasy, glorifies the Lord with precise philosophical prayers.

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *hi* — indeed; *bhūteṣu* — among manifested beings; *cara* — mobile; *acareṣu* — and immobile; *mahī*-*ādayaḥ* — earth and so on (the primary elements of creation); *yoniṣu* — in species; *bhānti* — manifest; *nānā* — variously; *evam* — so; *bhavān* — You; *kevalaḥ* — one alone; *ātma* — Yourself; *yoniṣu* — in those whose source; *ātmā* — the Supreme Soul; *ātma*-*tantraḥ* — self-reliant; *bahudhā* — manifold; *vibhāti* — appear.

### Translation

**Just as the primary elements — earth and so on — manifest themselves in abundant variety among all the species of mobile and immobile life, so You, the one independent Supreme Soul, appear to be manifold among the variegated objects of Your creation.**

rajas-tamaḥ-sattva-guṇaiḥ sva-śaktibhiḥ

### Synonyms

*sṛjasi* — You create; *atha* *u* — and then; *lumpasi* — You destroy; *pāsi* — You protect; *viśvam* — the universe; *rajaḥ* — known as passion; *tamaḥ* — ignorance; *sattva* — and goodness; *guṇaiḥ* — by the modes; *sva*-*śaktibhiḥ* — Your personal potencies; *na* *badhyase* — You are not bound; *tat* — of this world; *guṇa* — by the modes; *karmabhiḥ* — by the material activities; *vā* — or; *jñāna*-*ātmanaḥ* — who are knowledge itself; *te* — for You; *kva* *ca* — where at all; *bandha* — of bondage; *hetuḥ* — cause.

### Translation

**You create, destroy and also maintain this universe with Your personal energies — the modes of passion, ignorance and goodness — yet You are never entangled by these modes or the activities they generate. Since You are the original source of all knowledge, what could ever cause You to be bound by illusion?**

### Purport

The phrase *jñānātmanas te kva ca bandha-hetuḥ,* “Since You are constituted of knowledge, what could be a cause of bondage for You?” definitely indicates the obvious, that the omniscient Supreme God is never in illusion. Therefore the impersonalistic theory that we are all God but have forgotten and are now in illusion is refuted here in the pages of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Synonyms

*deha* — of the body; *ādi* — and so on; *upādheḥ* — as material, designative coverings; *anirūpitatvāt* — because of not being determined; *bhavaḥ* — birth; *na* — not; *sākṣāt* — literal; *na* — nor; *bhidā* — duality; *ātmanaḥ* — for the Supreme Soul; *syāt* — exists; *ataḥ* — therefore; *na* — no; *bandhaḥ* — bondage; *tava* — Your; *na* *eva* — nor, in fact; *mokṣaḥ* — liberation; *syātām* — if they occur; *nikāmaḥ* — by Your sweet will; *tvayi* — concerning You; *naḥ* — our; *avivekaḥ* — erroneous discrimination.

### Translation

**Since it has never been demonstrated that You are covered by material, bodily designations, it must be concluded that for You there is neither birth in a literal sense nor any duality. Therefore You never undergo bondage or liberation, and if You appear to, it is only because of Your desire that we see You in that way, or simply because of our lack of discrimination.**

### Purport

Here Akrūra states two reasons why the Lord appears to be covered by a material form, or to take birth like a human being. First, when Lord Kṛṣṇa executes His pastimes, His loving devotees think of Him as their beloved child, friend, lover and so on. In the ecstasy of this loving reciprocation, they do not think of Kṛṣṇa as God. For example, because of her extraordinary love for Him, mother Yaśodā worries that Kṛṣṇa will be injured in the forest. That she feels this way is the desire of the Lord, which is here indicated by the word *nikāmaḥ.* The second reason the Lord may appear material is indicated by the word *avivekaḥ:* Simply because of ignorance, a lack of discrimination, one may misunderstand the position of the Personality of Godhead. In the Eleventh Canto of the *Bhāgavatam,* in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s discussion with Śrī Uddhava, the Lord elaborately discusses His transcendental position beyond bondage and liberation. As stated in Vedic literature, *deha-dehi-vibhago yaṁ neśvare vidyate kvacit:* “There is never a distinction of body and soul in the Supreme Lord.” In other words, Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s body is eternal, spiritual, omniscient and the reservoir of all pleasure.

### Translation

**You originally enunciated the ancient religious path of the Vedas for the benefit of the whole universe. Whenever that path becomes obstructed by wicked persons following the path of atheism, You assume one of Your incarnations, which are all in the transcendental mode of goodness.**

You have done this to relieve the earth’s burden by killing hundreds of armies led by kings who are expansions of the demigods’ enemies, and also to spread the fame of our dynasty.**

### Purport

The term *suretarāṁśa-rājñām* indicates that the demoniac kings slain by Kṛṣṇa were in fact expansions or incarnations of the enemies of the demigods. This fact is elaborately explained in the *Mahābhārata,* which reveals the specific identities of the demoniac kings.

As the Supreme Truth, You embody the forefathers, ordinary creatures, human beings and demigods, and the water that has washed Your feet purifies the three worlds. Indeed, O transcendent one, You are the spiritual master of the universe.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī has nicely interpreted Akrūra’s feelings as follows:

Akrūra said, “My Lord, although I am a householder, today my home has become more pious than the forests where sages perform austerities. Why? Simply because You have entered my home. Indeed, You are the personification of the deities who preside over the five sacrifices a householder must perform daily to atone for unavoidable violence committed to living beings in the home. You are the spiritual truth behind all these creations, and now You have entered my home.”

The five daily sacrifices enjoined for a householder are (1) sacrifice to Brahman by studying the *Vedas,* (2) sacrifice to the forefathers by making offerings to them, (3) sacrifice to all creatures by putting aside a portion of one’s meals, (4) sacrifice to human beings by extending hospitality and (5) sacrifice to the demigods by performing fire sacrifices and so on.

### Translation

**What learned person would approach anyone but You for shelter, when You are the affectionate, grateful and truthful well-wisher of Your devotees? To those who worship You in sincere friendship You reward everything they desire, even Your own self, yet You never increase or diminish.**

### Purport

This verse describes both the Lord and His devotees as *suhṛdaḥ* “well-wishers.” The Lord is the well-wisher of His devotee, and the devotee lovingly desires all happiness for the Lord. Even in this world, an excess of love may sometimes produce unnecessary solicitude. For example, we often observe that a mother’s loving concern for her adult child is not always justified by an actual danger to the child. A grown child may be wealthy, competent and healthy, and yet the mother’s loving concern continues. Similarly, a pure devotee always feels loving concern for Lord Kṛṣṇa, as exemplified by mother Yaśodā, who could only think of Kṛṣṇa as her beautiful son.

Lord Kṛṣṇa had promised Akrūra that after killing Kaṁsa He would visit his home, and now the Lord kept His promise. Akrūra recognizes this and glorifies the Lord as *ṛta-giraḥ,* “one who is true to His word.” The Lord is *kṛta-jña,* grateful for whatever little worship a devotee offers, and even if the devotee forgets, the Lord does not.
