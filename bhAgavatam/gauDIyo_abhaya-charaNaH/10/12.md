CHAPTER TWELVE

This chapter describes in detail Kṛṣṇa’s pastime of killing Aghāsura.

One day Kṛṣṇa wanted to enjoy a picnic lunch within the forest, and therefore He went out early into the forest with the other cowherd boys, accompanied by their respective groups of calves. While they were enjoying their picnic, Aghāsura, the younger brother of Pūtanā and Bakāsura, appeared there, desiring to kill Kṛṣṇa and His companions. The demon, who had been sent by Kaṁsa, assumed the form of a python, expanding himself to a length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to the heavenly planets. Having assumed this feature, Aghāsura lay on the road. Kṛṣṇa’s friends, the cowherd boys, thought that the demon’s form was one of the beautiful spots of Vṛndāvana. Thus they wanted to enter within the mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became a subject for their sporting pleasure, and they began to laugh, confident that even if this figure were dangerous, Kṛṣṇa was there to protect them. In this way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure.

Kṛṣṇa knew everything about Aghāsura, and therefore He wanted to forbid His friends to enter the demon’s mouth, but in the meantime all the cowherd boys, along with their groups of calves, entered the mouth of that gigantic figure. Kṛṣṇa was waiting outside, and Aghāsura was waiting for Kṛṣṇa, thinking that as soon as Kṛṣṇa entered he would close his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for Kṛṣṇa, he refrained from swallowing the boys. In the meantime, Kṛṣṇa was thinking of how to save the boys and kill Aghāsura. Thus He entered the mouth of the gigantic *asura,* and when He was within the demon’s mouth along with His friends, He expanded His body to such an extent that the *asura* suffocated and died. After this, Kṛṣṇa, by casting His nectarean glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure they all came out unhurt. Thus Kṛṣṇa encouraged all the demigods, and they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful person there is no scope for *sāyujya-mukti,* or becoming one with the effulgence of Kṛṣṇa, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead entered the body of Aghāsura, by His touch this demon got the opportunity to merge into the existence of the Brahman effulgence and thus attain *sāyujya-mukti.*

When this pastime was performed, Kṛṣṇa was only five years old. One year later, when He was six years old and He stepped into the *paugaṇḍa* age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of Vraja. Parīkṣit Mahārāja inquired, “Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after one year and yet the inhabitants of Vraja thought that it had been performed that very day?” With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends.

Then Kṛṣṇa and the boys, keeping their respective groups of calves before them, proceeded from Vrajabhūmi to the forest.**

*kṛṣṇa-vatsair asaṅkhyātair  
yūthī-kṛtya sva-vatsakān  
cārayanto ’rbha-līlābhir  
vijahrus tatra tatra ha*

### Synonyms

*kṛṣṇa* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *vatsaiḥ* — along with the calves; *asaṅkhyātaiḥ* — unlimited; *yūthī*-*kṛtya* — assembled them; *sva*-*vatsakān* — personal calves; *cārayantaḥ* — executing; *arbha*-*līlābhiḥ* — by boyhood pastimes; *vijahruḥ* — enjoyed; *tatra* *tatra* — here and there; *ha* — indeed.

### Translation

**Along with the cowherd boys and their own groups of calves, Kṛṣṇa came out with an unlimited number of calves assembled. Then all the boys began to sport in the forest in a greatly playful spirit.**

### Purport

In this verse the words *kṛṣṇa-vatsair asaṅkhyātaiḥ* are significant. The word *asaṅkhyāta* means “unlimited.” Kṛṣṇa’s calves were unlimited. We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and so on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for us to count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers are indicated here by the word *asaṅkhyātaiḥ.* Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, His potency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is unlimited. Therefore He is described in *Bhagavad-gītā* as Parabrahman. The word *brahman* means “unlimited,” and Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Unlimited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements of this verse to be mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable. Kṛṣṇa can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an unlimited measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we study Kṛṣṇa’s potency with our limited knowledge, that potency will never be possible to understand. *Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ* (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.109). Our senses cannot perceive how He could keep an unlimited number of calves and cows and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta:*

*evaṁ prabhoḥ priyānāṁ ca  
dhāmnaś ca samayasya ca  
avicintya-prabhāvatvād  
atra kiñcin na durghaṭam*

Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, in the *Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta,* states that since everything about Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, nothing is impossible for Him. It is in this sense that we have to understand this verse.

*muṣṇanto ’nyonya-śikyādīn  
jñātān ārāc ca cikṣipuḥ  
tatratyāś ca punar dūrād

### Synonyms

*muṣṇantaḥ* — stealing; *anyonya* — from one another; *śikya*-*ādīn* — lunch bags and other belongings; *jñātān* — having been understood by the proprietor of the bag; *ārāt* *ca* — to a distant place; *cikṣipuḥ* — threw away; *tatratyāḥ* *ca* — those who were in that place also; *punaḥ* *dūrāt* — then again threw farther away; *hasantaḥ* *ca* *punaḥ* *daduḥ* — when they saw the proprietor, they threw it farther away and enjoyed laughing, and when the owner sometimes cried, his bag was given to him again.

### Translation

**All the cowherd boys used to steal one another’s lunch bags. When a boy came to understand that his bag had been taken away, the other boys would throw it farther away, to a more distant place, and those standing there would throw it still farther. When the proprietor of the bag became disappointed, the other boys would laugh, the proprietor would cry, and then the bag would be returned.**

### Purport

This kind of playing and stealing among boys still exists even in the material world because this kind of sporting pleasure is present in the spiritual world, from which this idea of enjoyment emanates. *Janmādy asya yataḥ* (*Vedānta-sūtra* 1.1.2). This same enjoyment is displayed by Kṛṣṇa and His associates in the spiritual world, but there the enjoyment is eternal, whereas here, on the material platform, it is temporary; there the enjoyment is *brahman,* whereas here the enjoyment is *jaḍa.* The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to train one how to transfer oneself from the *jaḍa* to the Brahman, because human life is meant for this purpose. *Athāto brahma jijñāsā* (*Vedānta-sūtra* 1.1.1). Kṛṣṇa comes down to teach us how we can enjoy with Him on the spiritual platform, in the spiritual world. Not only does He come, but He personally displays His pastimes in Vṛndāvana and attracts people to spiritual enjoyment.

### Translation

**Sometimes Kṛṣṇa would go to a somewhat distant place to see the beauty of the forest. Then all the other boys would run to accompany Him, each one saying, “I shall be the first to run and touch Kṛṣṇa! I shall touch Kṛṣṇa first!” In this way they enjoyed life by repeatedly touching Kṛṣṇa.**

### Translation

**All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn. Some imitated the buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the cuckoo. Some boys imitated flying birds by running after the birds’ shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful movements and attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of the peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys, some made faces as the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one branch to another. Some boys went to the waterfalls and crossed over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their own reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way, all the cowherd boys used to play with Kṛṣṇa, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence for jñānīs desiring to merge into that effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for devotees who have accepted eternal servitorship, and who for ordinary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys, having accumulated the results of pious activities for many lives, were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?**

### Purport

As recommended by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, *tasmāt kenāpy upāyena manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet* (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.4). Somehow or other, whether one thinks of Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary human child, as the source of the Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Paramātmā, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should concentrate one’s full attention upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is also the instruction of *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66): *sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.* *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the easiest way of directly approaching Kṛṣṇa. *Īśvaraḥ sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate ’tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt* (*Bhāg.* 1.1.2). Diverting even a little of one’s attention toward Kṛṣṇa and activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest perfection of life. This is the purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. *Lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām* (*Bhāg.* 1.7.6). The secret of success is unknown to people in general, and therefore Śrīla Vyāsadeva, being compassionate toward the poor souls in this material world, especially in this Age of Kali, has given us the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* *Śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ purāṇam amalaṁ yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyam* (*Bhāg.* 12.13.18). For Vaiṣṇavas who are somewhat advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the Lord, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we have to change this body (*tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ*). If we do not care about *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* we do not know what the next body will be. But if one adheres to these two books — *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* — one is sure to obtain the association of Kṛṣṇa in the next life (*tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*). Therefore, distribution of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* all over the world is a great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists and *yogīs* (*yoginām api sarveṣām*), as well as for people in general. *Janma-lābhaḥ paraḥ puṁsām ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ* (*Bhāg.* 2.1.6): if we can somehow or other remember Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa, at the end of life, our life will be successful.

### Purport

We can simply imagine the great fortune of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. It is impossible to describe how, after many, many births of pious activities, they have become so fortunate.

### Translation

**My dear King Parīkṣit, thereafter there appeared a great demon named Aghāsura, whose death was being awaited even by the demigods. The demigods drank nectar every day, but still they feared this great demon and awaited his death. This demon could not tolerate the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed in the forest by the cowherd boys.**

### Purport

One may ask how Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes could be interrupted by a demon. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura answers this question by saying that although the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed by the cowherd boys could not be stopped, unless they stopped the transcendental pleasure of their various activities they could not eat their lunch. Therefore at lunchtime Aghāsura appeared by the arrangement of Yoga-māyā, so that for the time being they could stop their activities and take lunch. Changing varieties is the mother of enjoyment. The cowherd boys would continuously play, then stop, and then again enjoy in a different way. Therefore every day a demon would come and interrupt their sporting pastimes. The demon would be killed, and then the boys would engage again in their transcendental pastimes.

*pīna* — very great; *ahi*-*bhoga*-*utthitam* — issuing from the serpent’s body, which was meant for material enjoyment; *adbhutam* — very wonderful; *mahat* — great; *jyotiḥ* — effulgence; *sva*-*dhāmnā* — by his own illumination; *jvalayat* — making glaring; *diśaḥ* *daśa* — all the ten directions; *pratīkṣya* — waiting; *khe* — in the sky; *avasthitam* — individually staying; *īśa*-*nirgamam* — until the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, came out; *viveśa* — entered; *tasmin* — in the body of Kṛṣṇa; *miṣatām* — while observing; *divaukasām* — all the demigods.

### Translation

**From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came out, illuminating all directions, and stayed individually in the sky until Kṛṣṇa came out from the corpse’s mouth. Then, as all the demigods looked on, this effulgence entered into Kṛṣṇa’s body.**

### Purport

Apparently the serpent named Aghāsura, because of having received association with Kṛṣṇa, attained *mukti* by entering Kṛṣṇa’s body. Entering the body of Kṛṣṇa is called *sāyujya-mukti,* but later verses prove that Aghāsura, like Dantavakra and others, received *sārūpya-mukti.* This has been broadly described by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura with references from the *Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. Aghāsura attained *sārūpya-mukti,* being promoted to the Vaikuṇṭha planets to live with the same four-armed bodily features as Viṣṇu. The explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows.

The effulgence came out from the python’s body and became purified, attaining spiritual *śuddha-sattva,* freedom from material contamination, because Kṛṣṇa had stayed within the serpent’s body, even after the serpent’s death. One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous activities, could attain the liberation of *sārūpya* or *sāyujya,* and one may be astonished about this. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the demigods.

Kṛṣṇa is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon’s body, individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the *brahmajyoti.* The Brahman effulgence is not visible to material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, Kṛṣṇa had this individual effulgence stay outside the demon’s body for some time, for everyone to see. Then Kṛṣṇa proved that anyone killed by Him attains liberation, whether *sāyujya, sārūpya, sāmīpya* or whatever.

But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is *vimukti,* special liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of Kṛṣṇa personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence. This merging is called *sāyujya-mukti.* But from later verses we find that Aghāsura attained *sārūpya-mukti.* Text 38 explains that Aghāsura attained a body exactly like that of Viṣṇu, and the verse after that also clearly states that he attained a completely spiritual body like that of Nārāyaṇa. Therefore in two or three places the *Bhāgavatam* has confirmed that Aghāsura attained *sārūpya-mukti.* One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained *sārūpya-mukti* and association with the Lord, Aghāsura received a similar liberation.

### Translation

**Thereafter, everyone being pleased, the demigods began to shower flowers from Nandana-kānana, the celestial dancing girls began to dance, and the Gandharvas, who are famous for singing, offered songs of prayer. The drummers began to beat their kettledrums, and the brāhmaṇas offered Vedic hymns. In this way, both in the heavens and on earth, everyone began to perform his own duties, glorifying the Lord.**

### Purport

Everyone has some particular duty. The *śāstra* has concluded (*nirūpitaḥ*) that everyone should glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his own qualifications. If you are a singer, always glorify the Supreme Lord by singing very nicely. If you are a musician, glorify the Supreme Lord by playing musical instruments. *Svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam* (*Bhāg.* 1.2.13). The perfection of life is to satisfy the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, beginning from this earth up to the celestial kingdom, everyone engaged in glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The decision of all great saintly persons is that whatever qualifications one has acquired should be utilized to glorify the Supreme Lord.

*idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā  
sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ  
avicyuto ’rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito  
yad uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam*

“Learned sages have definitely concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, austerity, Vedic study, sacrifice, the chanting of hymns, and charity is found in the transcendental descriptions of the qualities of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.” (*Bhāg.* 1.5.22) This is the perfection of life. One should be trained how to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one’s respective qualities. Education, austerity, penance or, in the modern world, business, industry, education and so on — all should be engaged in glorifying the Lord. Then everyone in the world will be happy.

Kṛṣṇa comes, therefore, to exhibit His transcendental activities so that people may have the chance to glorify Him in every respect. To understand how to glorify the Lord is actual research work. It is not that everything should be understood without God. That is condemned.

*bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasya  
jātiḥ śāstraṁ japas tapaḥ  
aprāṇasyaiva dehasya  
maṇḍanaṁ loka-rañjanam*

(*Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya* 3.11)

Without *bhagavad-bhakti,* without glorification of the Supreme Lord, whatever we have is simply a decoration of the dead body.

### Purport

The word *mokṣaṇam* means “liberation.” For the associates of Kṛṣṇa and for Kṛṣṇa Himself, there is no question about liberation; they are already liberated, being in the spiritual world. In the material world there are birth, death, old age and disease, but in the spiritual world there are no such things because everything is eternal. As for the python, however, by the association of Kṛṣṇa and His devotees, Aghāsura also achieved the same facility of eternal life. Therefore, as indicated here by the word *ātmāhi-mokṣaṇam,* if the python Aghāsura could receive eternal association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are already associates of the Lord? *Sākaṁ vijahruḥ kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ* (*Bhāg.* 10.12.11). Here is proof that God is good for everyone. Even when He kills someone, the one who is killed attains liberation. What then is to be said of those who are already in the association of the Lord?

*na* — not; *etat* — this; *vicitram* — is wonderful; *manuja*-*arbha*-*māyinaḥ* — of Kṛṣṇa, who appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā, being compassionate upon them; *para*-*avarāṇām* — of all causes and effects; *paramasya* *vedhasaḥ* — of the supreme creator; *aghaḥ* *api* — Aghāsura also; *yat*-*sparśana* — simply by the slight association of whom; *dhauta*-*pātakaḥ* — became freed from all contamination of material existence; *prāpa* — became elevated; *ātma*-*sāmyam* — to a body exactly resembling that of Nārāyaṇa; *tu* — but; *asatām* *sudurlabham* — which is not at all possible to be obtained by contaminated souls (but everything can be possible by the mercy of the Supreme Lord).

### Translation

**Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes. The causes and effects of the material world, both higher and lower, are all created by the Supreme Lord, the original controller. When Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā, He did so by His causeless mercy. Consequently, for Him to exhibit His unlimited opulence was not at all wonderful. Indeed, He showed such great mercy that even Aghāsura, the most sinful miscreant, was elevated to being one of His associates and achieving sārūpya-mukti, which is actually impossible for materially contaminated persons to attain.**

### Purport

The word *māyā* is also used in connection with love. Out of *māyā,* love, a father has affection for his child. Therefore the word *māyinaḥ* indicates that Kṛṣṇa, out of love, appeared as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and assumed the form of a human child (*manujārbha*). Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes. He is the creator of cause and effect, and He is the supreme controller. Nothing is impossible for Him. Therefore, that He enabled even a living being like Aghāsura to attain the salvation of *sārūpya-mukti* was not at all wonderful for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa took pleasure in entering the mouth of Aghāsura in a sporting spirit along with His associates. Therefore, when Aghāsura, by that sporting association, as maintained in the spiritual world, was purified of all contamination, he attained *sārūpya-mukti* and *vimukti* by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. For Kṛṣṇa this was not at all wonderful.

**If even only once or even by force one brings the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead into one’s mind, one can attain the supreme salvation by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, as did Aghāsura.

### Purport

The process for receiving the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. *Yat-pāda-paṅkaja-palāśa-vilāsa-bhaktyā* (*Bhāg.* 4.22.39). Simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa, one can attain Him very easily. Kṛṣṇa is also described as having His lotus feet always within the hearts of His devotees (*bhagavān bhakta-hṛdi sthitaḥ*). In the case of Aghāsura, one may argue that he was not a devotee. The answer to this is that he thought of Kṛṣṇa for a moment with devotion. *Bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ.* Without devotion, one cannot think of Kṛṣṇa; and, conversely, whenever one thinks of Kṛṣṇa, one undoubtedly has devotion. Although Aghāsura’s purpose was to kill Kṛṣṇa, for a moment Aghāsura thought of Kṛṣṇa with devotion, and Kṛṣṇa and His associates wanted to sport within Aghāsura’s mouth. Similarly, Pūtanā wanted to kill Kṛṣṇa by poisoning Him, but Kṛṣṇa took her as His mother because He had accepted the milk of her breast. *Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt* (*Bg.* 2.40). Especially when Kṛṣṇa appears as an *avatāra,* anyone who thinks of Kṛṣṇa in His different incarnations (*rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan*), and especially in His original form as Kṛṣṇa, attains salvation. There are many instances of this, and among them is Aghāsura, who attained the salvation of *sārūpya-mukti.* Therefore the process is *satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ* (Bg. 9.14). Those who are devotees always engage in glorifying Kṛṣṇa. *Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam:* when we speak of Kṛṣṇa, we refer to all His *avatāras,* such as Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, Lord Caitanya, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma and Śyāmasundara. One who always thinks of Kṛṣṇa must attain *vimukti,* special salvation as the Lord’s personal associate, not necessarily in Vṛndāvana, but at least in Vaikuṇṭha. This is called *sārūpya-mukti.*

### Translation

**O my lord, my spiritual master, although we are the lowest of kṣatriyas, we are glorified and benefited because we have the opportunity of always hearing from you the nectar of the pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to hear such activities unless one is very, very fortunate. Parīkṣit Mahārāja placed himself as *kṣatra-bandhavaḥ,* which means “the lowest of the *kṣatriyas.*” The qualities of the *kṣatriya* are described in *Bhagavad-gītā,* and although the general quality of the *kṣatriya* is *īśvara-bhāva,* the tendency to rule, a *kṣatriya* is not supposed to rule over a *brāhmaṇa.* Thus Mahārāja Parīkṣit regretted that he had wanted to rule over the *brāhmaṇas* and had therefore been cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the *kṣatriyas.* *Dānam īśvara-bhāvaś ca kṣātraṁ karma svabhāvajam* (Bg. 18.43). There was no doubt that Mahārāja Parīkṣit had the good qualities of a *kṣatriya,* but as a devotee he presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the *kṣatriyas,* remembering his act of wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a *brāhmaṇa.* A student and disciple has the right to ask the *guru* about any confidential service, and it is the duty of the *guru* to explain these confidential matters to his disciple.

**Sūta Gosvāmī said: O Śaunaka, greatest of saints and devotees, when Mahārāja Parīkṣit inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī in this way, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, immediately remembering subject matters about Kṛṣṇa within the core of his heart, externally lost contact with the actions of his senses. Thereafter, with great difficulty, he revived his external sensory perception and began to speak to Mahārāja Parīkṣit about kṛṣṇa-kathā.**
