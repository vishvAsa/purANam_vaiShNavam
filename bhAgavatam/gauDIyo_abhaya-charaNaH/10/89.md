CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE

This chapter describes how Bhṛgu Muni proved the supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, and how Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna recovered the dead sons of an aggrieved *brāhmaṇa* in Dvārakā.

Once, long ago, on the shore of the river Sarasvatī, a discussion arose among a group of sages as to which of the three chief lords — Brahmā, Viṣṇu or Śiva — is the greatest. They deputed Bhṛgu Muni to investigate the matter.

Bhṛgu decided to test the lords’ tolerance, for that quality is a sure sign of greatness. First he entered the court of Lord Brahmā, his father, without offering him any respect. This enraged Brahmā, who suppressed his anger because Bhṛgu was his son. Next Bhṛgu went to Lord Śiva, his older brother, who rose from his seat to embrace him. But Bhṛgu rejected the embrace, calling Śiva a deviant heretic. Just as Śiva was about to kill Bhṛgu with his trident, Goddess Pārvatī interceded and pacified her husband. Next Bhṛgu went to Vaikuṇṭha to test Lord Nārāyaṇa. Going up to the Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of the goddess of fortune, Bhṛgu kicked His chest. But instead of becoming angry, both the Lord and His consort stood up and offered Bhṛgu respects. “Welcome,” said the Lord. “Please sit down and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival.” When Bhṛgu went back to the assembly of sages and told them all that had happened, they concluded that Lord Viṣṇu is certainly supreme.

Once in Dvārakā a *brāhmaṇa’s* wife gave birth to a son who immediately died. The *brāhmaṇa* took his dead son to the court of King Ugrasena and berated the King: “This duplicitous, greedy enemy of *brāhmaṇas* has caused my son’s death by failing to execute his duties properly!” The same misfortune continued to befall the *brāhmaṇa,* and each time he would bring his dead infant’s body to the royal court and berate the King. When the ninth son died at birth, Arjuna happened to hear the *brāhmaṇa’s* complaint, and he said, “My lord, I will protect your progeny. And if I fail, I will enter fire to atone for my sin.”

Some time later, the *brāhmaṇa’s* wife was about to give birth for the tenth time. When Arjuna learned of this, he went to the maternity house and enveloped it with a protective cage of arrows. Arjuna’s efforts were to no avail, however, for as soon as the child was born and began to cry, it disappeared into the sky. As the *brāhmaṇa* profusely derided Arjuna, the warrior set off for the abode of Yamarāja, the king of death. But Arjuna did not find the *brāhmaṇa’s* son there, and even after searching throughout the fourteen worlds he could find no trace of the infant.

Having failed to protect the *brāhmaṇa’s* son, Arjuna was now intent on committing suicide by entering the sacred fire. But just as he was about to do so, Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped him and said, “I will show you the *brāhmaṇa’s* sons, so please don’t despise yourself like this.” Lord Kṛṣṇa then took Arjuna onto His transcendental chariot, and the two of them crossed over the seven universal islands with their seven oceans, passed over the Lokāloka mountain range and entered the region of dense darkness. Since the horses could not find their way, Kṛṣṇa sent His blazing Sudarśana disc ahead to pierce the gloom. Gradually they came to the water of the Causal Ocean, within which they found the city of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu. There they saw the thousand-hooded serpent Ananta and upon Him lay Mahā-Viṣṇu. The great Lord greeted Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, saying “I brought the *brāhmaṇa’s* sons here simply because I wanted to see the two of you. Please continue to benefit the people in general by exemplifying religious behavior in your forms of Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi.”

Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna then took the *brāhmaṇa’s* sons, went back to Dvārakā and returned the infants to their father. Having directly experienced the greatness of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna was amazed. He concluded that only by the Lord’s mercy can a living being exhibit any power or opulence.

### Verse text

*tasya jijñāsayā te vai  
bhṛguṁ brahma-sutaṁ nṛpa  
taj-jñaptyai preṣayām āsuḥ  
so ’bhjagād brahmaṇaḥ sabhām*

### Synonyms

*tasya* — about this; *jijñāsayā* — with the desire of knowing; *te* — they; *vai* — indeed; *bhṛgum* — Bhṛgu Muni; *brahma*-*sutam* — son of Brahmā; *nṛpa* — O King; *tat* — this; *jñaptyai* — to find out; *preṣayām* *āsuḥ* — they sent; *saḥ* — he; *abhyagāt* — went; *brahmaṇaḥ* — of Lord Brahmā; *sabhām* — to the court.

### Translation

**Eager to resolve this question, O King, the sages sent Lord Brahmā’s son Bhṛgu to find the answer. First he went to his father’s court.**

### Purport

As Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead:* “The plan decided upon by the sages was for Bhṛgu to test which one of the predominating deities possessed the quality of goodness in full.” One who is in the mode of goodness possesses such qualities as tolerance and equanimity, whereas those conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance are prone to easily lose their temper.

### Translation

### Devanagari

स आत्मन्युत्थितं मन्युमात्मजायात्मना प्रभु- ।  
अशीशमद् यथा वह्निं स्वयोन्या वारिणात्मभू- ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*sa ātmany utthitam manyum  
ātmajāyātmanā prabhuḥ  
aśīśamad yathā vahniṁ  
sva-yonyā vāriṇātma-bhūḥ*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — he; *ātmani* — within himself; *utthitam* — risen; *manyum* — anger; *ātma*-*jāya* — toward his son; *ātmanā* — by his own intelligence; *prabhuḥ* — the lord; *aśīśamat* — subdued; *yathā* — just as; *vahnim* — fire; *sva* — itself; *yonyā* — whose origin; *vāriṇā* — by water; *ātma*-*bhūḥ* — self-born Brahmā.

### Translation

**Though anger toward his son was now rising within his heart, Lord Brahmā was able to subdue it by applying his intelligence, in the same way that fire is extinguished by its own product, water.**

### Purport

Lord Brahmā is sometimes affected by his contact with the mode of passion. But because he is *ādi-kavi,* the firstborn and foremost learned scholar in the universe, when anger begins to disturb his mind he can control it by means of discriminating self-examination. In this instance he reminded himself that Bhṛgu was his son. Thus in this verse Śukadeva Gosvāmī draws the analogy that Brahmā’s own expansion (his son) served to put out his anger just as water, which originally evolved from elemental fire in the primeval creation, puts out a fire.

In the Vedic civilization it is considered very important to properly greet one’s family members, especially when one has not seen them for a long time. A worthy son should show respect to his father, a younger brother should honor his older brother, and the older brother should show affection to his younger brother in turn.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**But Bhṛgu refused his embrace, telling him, “You are a deviant heretic.” At this Lord Śiva became angry, and his eyes burned ferociously. He raised his trident and was about to kill Bhṛgu when Goddess Devī fell at his feet and spoke some words to pacify him. Bhṛgu then left that place and went to Vaikuṇṭha, where Lord Janārdana resides.**

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa,* Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “It is said that an offense can be committed either with the body, with the mind or by speech. Bhṛgu Muni’s first offense, committed toward Lord Brahmā, was an offense with the mind. His second offense, committed toward Lord Śiva by insulting him, criticizing him for unclean habits, was an offense by speech. Because the quality of ignorance is prominent in Lord Śiva, when he heard Bhṛgu’s insult his eyes immediately became red with anger. With uncontrollable rage, he took up his trident and prepared to kill Bhṛgu Muni. At that time Lord Śiva’s wife, Pārvatī, was present. Her personality, like Lord Siva’s, is a mixture of the three qualities, and therefore she is called Triguṇa-mayī. In this case, she saved the situation by evoking Lord Śiva’s quality of goodness.”

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī remarks that the Vaikuṇṭha planet referred to here is Śvetadvīpa.

### Translation

**There he went up to the Supreme Lord, who was lying with His head on the lap of His consort, Śrī, and kicked Him on the chest. The Lord then rose, along with Goddess Lakṣmī, as a sign of respect. Coming down from His bedstead, that supreme goal of all pure devotees bowed His head to the floor before the sage and told him, ‘Welcome, brāhmaṇa. Please sit in this chair and rest awhile. Kindly forgive us, dear master, for not noticing your arrival.’**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, at the time of this pastime Bhṛgu Muni had not yet become a pure Vaiṣṇava; otherwise he would not have acted so rashly toward the Supreme Lord. Not only was Lord Viṣṇu taking rest, but He was lying with His head in His wife’s lap. For Bhṛgu to strike Him in this position — and not with his hand but with his foot — was worse than any other offense Bhṛgu could have imagined.

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “Of course, Lord Viṣṇu is all-merciful. He did not become angry at the activities of Bhṛgu Muni, for Bhṛgu Muni was a great *brāhmaṇa.* A *brāhmaṇa* is to be excused even if he sometimes commits an offense, and Lord Viṣṇu set the example. Yet it is said that from the time of this incident the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, has not been very favorably disposed toward the *brāhmaṇas,* and therefore because the goddess of fortune withholds her benedictions from them, the *brāhmaṇas* are generally very poor.”

This holy water is indeed what makes all places of pilgrimage sacred. Today, my lord, I have become the exclusive shelter of the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī; she will consent to reside on My chest because your foot has rid it of sins.”**

### Purport

Continuing his comments, Śrīla Prabhupāda says: “The so-called *brāhmaṇas* of the Kali-yuga are sometimes very proud that a great *brāhmaṇa* like Bhṛgu Muni could touch the chest of Lord Viṣṇu with his foot. But in fact, when Bhṛgu Muni kicked the chest of Lord Viṣṇu it was the greatest offense, although Lord Viṣṇu, being greatly magnanimous, did not take it very seriously.”

Some editions of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* contain the following verse between texts 11 and 12, and Śrīla Prabhupāda also includes it in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* his summary study of the Tenth Canto:

*atīva-komalau tāta  
caraṇau te mahā-mune  
ity uktvā vipra-caraṇau  
mardayan svena pāṇinā*

“\[The Lord said to the *brāhmaṇa* Bhṛgu:\] ‘My dear sir, O great sage, your feet are indeed very tender.’ Saying this, Lord Viṣṇu began massaging the *brāhmaṇa’s* feet with His own hands.”

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Bhṛgu felt satisfied and delighted to hear the solemn words spoken by Lord Vaikuṇṭha. Overwhelmed with devotional ecstasy, he remained silent, his eyes brimming with tears.**

### Purport

Bhṛgu could not offer the Lord any words of praise because his throat was choking with tears of ecstasy. In the opinion of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the sage should not be condemned for his offensive behavior, since his role in this transcendental pastime was arranged by the Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Amazed upon hearing Bhṛgu’s account, the sages were freed from all doubts and became convinced that Viṣṇu is the greatest Lord. From Him come peace; fearlessness; the essential principles of religion; detachment with knowledge; the eightfold powers of mystic yoga; and His glorification, which cleanses the mind of all impurities. He is known as the supreme destination for those who are peaceful and equipoised — the selfless, wise saints who have given up all violence. His most dear form is that of pure goodness, and the brāhmaṇas are His worshipable deities. Persons of keen intellect who have attained spiritual peace worship Him without selfish motives.**

### Purport

By becoming devoted to the Personality of Godhead, one easily attains divine knowledge and detachment from sense gratification, without separate endeavor. As described in the Eleventh Canto of *Śrīmad* *Bhāgavatam* (11.2.42):

*bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir  
anyatra caiṣa trika eka-kālaḥ  
prapadyamānasya yathāśnataḥ syus  
tuṣṭiḥ puṣṭiḥ kṣud-apāyo ’nu-ghāsam*

“Devotion, direct experience of the Supreme Lord, and detachment from other things — these three occur simultaneously for one who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the same way that pleasure, nourishment and relief from hunger come simultaneously and increasingly, with each bite, for a person engaged in eating.” Similarly, in the First Canto (1.2.7), Śrīla Suta Gosvāmī states:

*vāsudeve bhagavati  
bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ  
janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ  
jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam*

“By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world.”

Lord Śrī Kapila, in His instructions to His mother, Devahūti, proposes that the eightfold powers of *yoga* are also coincidental fruits of devotional service:

*atho vibhūtiṁ mama māyāvinas tām  
aiśvaryam aṣṭāṅgam anupravṛttam  
śrīyaṁ bhāgavatīṁ vāspṛhayanti bhadrāṁ  
parasya me te ’śnuvate hi loke*

“Because he is completely absorbed in thought of Me, My devotee does not desire even the highest benediction obtainable in the upper planetary systems, including Satyaloka. He does not desire the eight material perfections obtained from mystic *yoga,* nor does he desire to be elevated to the kingdom of God. Yet even without desiring them, My devotee enjoys, even in this life, all the offered benedictions.” (*Bhāg.* 3.25.37)

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that in text 16, three kinds of transcendentalists are named: the *munis,* the *śāntas* and the *sādhus.* These are, in order of increasing importance, persons striving for liberation, those who have attained liberation, and those who are engaged in pure devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu.

त्रिविधाकृतयस्तस्य राक्षसा असुरा- सुरा- ।

### Verse text

*tri-vidhākṛtayas tasya  
rākṣasā asurāḥ surāḥ  
guṇinyā māyayā sṛṣṭāḥ  
sattvaṁ tat tīrtha-sādhanam*

### Synonyms

*tri*-*vidha* — of three kinds; *ākṛtayaḥ* — forms; *tasya* — of His; *rākṣasāḥ* — the ignorant spirits; *asurāḥ* — the demons; *surāḥ* — and the demigods; *guṇinyāḥ* — qualified by the material modes; *māyayā* — by His material energy; *sṛṣṭāḥ* — created; *sattvam* — the mode of goodness; *tat* — among them; *tīrtha* — of success in life; *sādhanam* — the means of attainment.

### Translation

**The Lord expands into three kinds of manifest beings — the Rākṣasas, the demons and the demigods — all of whom are created by the Lord’s material energy and conditioned by her modes. But among these three modes, it is the mode of goodness which is the means of attaining life’s final success.**

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa* Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: “There are different kinds of people existing in the modes of material nature. Those who are in the mode of ignorance are called *rākṣasas,* those in the mode of passion are called *asuras* \[demons\], and those in the mode of goodness are called *suras,* or demigods. Under the direction of the Supreme Lord, these three classes of men are created by material nature, but those who are in the mode of goodness have a greater chance to be elevated to the spiritual world, back home, back to Godhead.”

A traveler who constantly drinks this nectar through his ear-holes will forget the fatigue brought on by wandering along the paths of worldly life.**

### Purport

This narration by Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī is precious in two ways: For those suffering from spiritual infirmity it is an effective tonic to cure the disease of illusion. And for surrendered Vaiṣṇavas it is a delicious and invigorating beverage, fragrant with the aroma of Śrī Śuka’s realizations.

### Translation

### Purport

Presuming that he himself had done nothing to cause his son’s death, the *brāhmaṇa* thought it reasonable to blame King Ugrasena. In the Vedic social system, the monarch is considered responsible for everything occurring in his kingdom, good or bad. Even in a democracy, a manager who takes charge of some group or project should accept personal responsibility for any failure rather than, as is so common today, trying to place the blame on his subordinates or superiors.

Isn’t there some lowly member of the royal order here who can at least stand before your house with a bow in his hand? These kṣatriyas are behaving as if they were brāhmaṇas idly engaged in fire sacrifices.**

But just as he was about to do so, Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped him and spoke the following words.**

In the open space there is sunlight, and therefore it is illuminated, but in the covering, because of the absence of sunlight, it is naturally dark.”

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following insight into this verse. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s horses had descended from Vaikuṇṭha to participate in His earthly pastimes. Since the Lord Himself was pretending to be a finite human being, His steeds now acted confused to enhance the drama of the situation for all who would one day hear this pastime.

### Purport

After breaking through each of the eight concentric shells of the universe, the Sudarśana disc led Lord Kṛṣṇa’s chariot into the limitless, self-effulgent atmosphere of the spiritual sky. This journey by Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna to Vaikuṇṭha is also narrated in *Śrī Hari-vaṁśa,* where the Lord is quoted as telling His companion:

*brahma-tejo-mayaṁ divyaṁ  
mahat yad dṛṣṭavān asi  
ahaṁ sa bharata-śreṣṭha  
mat-tejas tat sanātanam*

“The divine expanse of Brahman effulgence you have seen is none other than Myself, O best of the Bhāratas. It is My own eternal effulgence.”

*prakṛtiḥ sā mama parā  
vyaktāvyaktā sanātanī  
tāṁ praviśya bhavantīha  
muktā yoga-vid-uttamāḥ*

“It comprises My eternal, spiritual energy, both manifest and unmanifest. The foremost *yoga* experts of this world enter within it and become liberated.”

*sā sāṅkhyānāṁ gatiḥ pārtha  
yogināṁ ca tapasvinām  
tat paraṁ paramaṁ brahma  
sarvaṁ vibhajate jagat  
mamaiva tad ghanaṁ tejo  
jñātum arhasi bhārata*

“It is the supreme goal of the followers of Sāṅkhya, O Pārtha, as well as that of the *yogīs* and ascetics. It is the Supreme Absolute Truth, manifesting the varieties of the entire created cosmos. You should understand this *brahma-jyoti,* O Bhārata, to be My concentrated personal effulgence.”

His profuse locks of hair were bathed on all sides in the brilliance reflected from the clusters of precious jewels decorating His crown and earrings. He wore the Kaustubha gem, the mark of Śrīvatsa and a garland of forest flowers. Serving that topmost of all Lords were His personal attendants, headed by Sunanda and Nanda; His cakra and other weapons in their personified forms; His consort potencies Puṣṭi, Śrī, Kīrti and Ajā; and all His various mystic powers.**

### Purport

Śrīla Prabhupāda mentions that “the Lord has innumerable energies, and they were also standing there personified. The most important among them were as follows: Puṣṭi, the energy for nourishment; Śrī, the energy of beauty; Kīrti, the energy of reputation; and Ajā, the energy of material creation. All these energies are invested in the administrators of the material world, namely Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu, and in the kings of the heavenly planets, Indra, Candra, Varuṇa and the sungod. In other words, all these demigods, being empowered by the Lord with certain energies, engage in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”

Then, as the two of them stood before Him with joined palms, the almighty Mahā-Viṣṇu, supreme master of all rulers of the universe, smiled and spoke to them in a voice full of solemn authority.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī makes the following observations on this verse: Just as Lord Kṛṣṇa offered obeisances to His own Deity during the worship of Govardhana Hill, so now also He paid homage to His Viṣṇu expansion for the purpose of playing out His pastimes. The Lord is *ananta,* possessed of countless manifestations, and this eight-armed form is among them. He is *acyuta,* “never falling from His position,” in the sense that He never stops engaging in His humanlike pastimes as a cowherd boy of Vṛndāvana. Thus to safeguard the special sanctity of His humanlike pastimes as Kṛṣṇa, He offered obeisances to His own plenary expansion.

Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu appeared before Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna as *bhūmā,* the supremely opulent one, and as *parameṣṭhināṁ prabhuḥ,* the Lord of multitudes of Brahmās ruling over millions of universes. With solemn authority He spoke in such a way as to bewilder Arjuna, in obedience to Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s intention. His smile hinted at His private thoughts, which Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has revealed for our benefit: “My dear Kṛṣṇa, by Your desire I will describe My superiority, even though I am Your expansion. At the same time, however, I will subtly imply in My statements the supreme position of Your beauty, character and power and the fact that You are the source from which I emanate. Just see how clever I am — that in front of Arjuna I am confidentially divulging My true identity as nondifferent from You.”

### Purport

As explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the secret import of these words spoken for Arjuna’s edification is as follows: “You two, who have descended along with your *kalās,* your personal energies, should kindly return to Me after killing the demons who burden the earth. Please quickly send these demons here to Me for the sake of their liberation.” It is stated in *Śrī Hari-vaṁśa* and in the Second Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that the path of gradual liberation passes through the intermediate station of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu’s abode, outside the eighth shell of the universe.

### Translation

**Having seen the domain of Lord Viṣṇu, Arjuna was totally amazed. He concluded that whatever extraordinary power a person exhibits can only be a manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s mercy.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes Arjuna’s amazement: He thought, “Just see! Even though I am a mere mortal, by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy I have seen the Supreme Godhead, the root cause of everything.” Then, after a moment, he thought again, “But why did Lord Viṣṇu say that he took away the *brāhmaṇa’s* children out of a desire to see Kṛṣṇa? Why would the Supreme Personality of Godhead hanker to see His own expansion? This might be the effect of some peculiar temporary circumstance, but since He said *didṛkṣuṇā* instead of *didṛkṣatā* — where the specific suffix *ṣuṇā* carries the sense of a permanent characteristic, not a temporary one — it has to be concluded that He has always been wanting to see Kṛṣṇa and myself. Even granted that this is so, why couldn’t He simply see Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā? After all, Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu is the all-pervading creator of the universe, which He holds like an *āmalaka* fruit in His hand. Is it that He could not see Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā because Kṛṣṇa does not allow anyone to see Him without His special sanction?

“And why, also, would Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, the compassionate master of all *brāhmaṇas,* have repeatedly tormented an elevated *brāhmaṇa,* year after year? He must have acted in this unusual way only because He could not give up His extreme eagerness to see Kṛṣṇa. All right, He may have acted improperly for that reason, but why couldn’t He have sent a servant to kidnap the *brāhmaṇa’s* sons? Why did He Himself have to come to Dvārakā? Was stealing them out of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s capital so difficult that no one but Viṣṇu Himself could hope to accomplish it? I can understand that He intended to cause so much distress to a *brāhmaṇa* of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s city that Kṛṣṇa would be unable to tolerate it; then He would grant Lord Viṣṇu His audience. Lord Viṣṇu inspired the distressed *brāhmaṇa* to pour out his complaints to Kṛṣṇa in person. Thus it is clear that Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s status of Godhood is superior to Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu’s.”

Having thought in this way, Arjuna was totally amazed. He asked Lord Kṛṣṇa whether these were actually the facts of the matter, and the Lord replied, as related in the *Hari-vaṁśa:*

*mad-darśanārthaṁ te bālā  
hṛtās tena mahātmanā  
viprārtham eṣyate kṛṣṇo  
mat-samīpaṁ na cānyathā*

“It was to see Me that He, the Supreme Soul, stole the children. He believed, ‘Only on a *brāhmaṇa’s* behalf will Kṛṣṇa come to see Me, not otherwise.’”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī states that Lord Kṛṣṇa further told Arjuna, “I did not go there, however, for the *brāhmaṇa’s* sake; I went there, My friend, just to save your life. If it had been for the *brāhmaṇa’s* sake that I traveled to Vaikuṇṭha, I would have done so after his first child was abducted.”

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, although this pastime occurred before the Battle of Kurukṣetra, it is recounted here at the end of the Tenth Canto under the general heading of the supremacy of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s glories.
