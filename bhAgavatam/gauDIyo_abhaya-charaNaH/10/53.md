CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE

This chapter describes how Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa arrived in Kuṇḍina, the capital of Vidarbha, and kidnapped Rukmiṇī in the presence of powerful enemies.

After Lord Kṛṣṇa had heard the *brāhmaṇa* messenger recite Rukmiṇī’s letter, the Lord said to him, “I am indeed attracted to Rukmiṇī, and I know of her brother Rukmī’s opposition to My marrying her. Therefore I must kidnap her after crushing all the low-class kings, just as one might generate fire from wood by friction.” Since the solemnizing of vows between Rukmiṇī and Śiśupāla was scheduled to occur in only three days, Lord Kṛṣṇa had Dāruka ready His chariot at once. Then He immediately set out for Vidarbha, which He reached after one night’s travel.

King Bhīṣmaka, trapped by his affection for his son Rukmī, was prepared to give his daughter to Śiśupāla. Bhīṣmaka saw to all the necessary preparations: he had the city decorated in various ways and had its main roads and intersections thoroughly cleansed. Damaghoṣa, the King of Cedi, having also done everything necessary to prepare for his son’s marriage, arrived in Vidarbha. King Bhīṣmaka greeted him properly and gave him a place to stay. Many other kings, such as Jarāsandha, Śālva and Dantavakra, also came to witness the occasion. These enemies of Kṛṣṇa had conspired to kidnap the bride if Kṛṣṇa came. They planned to fight Him together and thus guarantee Śiśupāla his bride. Hearing of these plans, Lord Baladeva gathered His entire army and quickly went to Kuṇḍinapura.

On the night before the wedding, Rukmiṇī, about to retire, had still not seen either the *brāhmaṇa* or Kṛṣṇa arrive. In anxiety, she cursed her bad fortune. But just then she felt her left side twitch, a good omen. Indeed, the *brāhmaṇa* shortly appeared and related to her what Kṛṣṇa had said, including His firm promise to kidnap her.

When King Bhīṣmaka heard that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma had arrived, he went out to greet Them to the accompaniment of triumphant music. He worshiped the Lords with various gifts and then designated residences for Them. Thus the King showed due respect to the Lords, as he did to each of his numerous royal guests.

The people of Vidarbha, seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa, remarked to one another that He alone would be a suitable husband for Rukmiṇī. They prayed that on the strength of whatever pious credit they had, Kṛṣṇa might win Rukmiṇī’s hand.

When the time came for Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī-devī to visit the temple of Śrī Ambikā, she proceeded there surrounded by many guards. After bowing down to the deity, Rukmiṇī prayed to be allowed to have Śrī Kṛṣṇa as her husband. Then she took the hand of a girlfriend and left the Ambikā temple. Seeing her inexpressible beauty, the great heroes present dropped their weapons and fell to the ground unconscious. Rukmiṇī walked with deliberate steps until she noticed Kṛṣṇa. Then, as everyone looked on, Śrī Kṛṣṇa took Rukmiṇī onto His chariot. Like a lion claiming his rightful share from a band of jackals, He drove back all the opposing kings and slowly made His exit, followed by His associates. Jarāsandha and the other kings, unable to bear their defeat and dishonor, loudly condemned themselves, declaring that this defamation was like a petty animal’s stealing away what rightfully belongs to the lion.

### Purport

The word *saṁhatāḥ,* which normally means “bound tightly together,” may also mean “thoroughly struck down” or “killed.” Thus although Kṛṣṇa’s enemies thought they were unified and strong — *saṁhatāḥ* in the former sense — they could not successfully oppose the Personality of Godhead, and consequently they would be struck down and killed — *saṁhatāḥ* in the latter sense.

### Verse text

*api mayy anavadyātmā  
dṛṣṭvā kiñcij jugupsitam  
mat-pāṇi-grahaṇe nūnaṁ  
nāyāti hi kṛtodyamaḥ*

### Synonyms

*api* — perhaps; *mayi* — in me; *anavadya* — faultless; *ātmā* — He whose body and mind; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *kiñcit* — something; *jugupsitam* — contemptible; *mat* — my; *pāṇi* — hand; *grahaṇe* — for the taking; *nūnam* — indeed; *na* *āyāti* — has not come; *hi* — certainly; *kṛta*-*udyamaḥ* — even though originally intending to do so.

### Translation

**Perhaps the faultless Lord, even while preparing to come here, saw something contemptible in me and therefore has not come to take my hand.**

### Purport

Princess Rukmiṇī boldly invited Śrī Kṛṣṇa to kidnap her. When Rukmiṇī did not see Him come, she naturally feared that He had rejected her proposal, perhaps finding some unacceptable quality in her. As expressed here, the Lord Himself is *anavadya,* faultless, and if He saw some fault in Rukmiṇī she would be an unworthy bride for Him. It was natural for the young princess to feel such anxiety. Furthermore, if Śrī Kṛṣṇa had actually made this decision, it would be natural for the *brāhmaṇa* to fear Rukmiṇī’s reaction were he to bring her the news, and that would explain why he had not come.

दुर्भगाया न मे धाता नानुकूलो महेश्वर- । देवी वा विमुखी गौरी रुद्राणी गिरिजा सती ॥ २५ ॥

### Verse text

*durbhagāyā na me dhātā  
nānukūlo maheśvaraḥ  
devī vā vimukhī gaurī  
rudrāṇī girijā satī*

### Synonyms

*durbhagāyāḥ* — who is unfortunate; *na* — not; *me* — with me; *dhātā* — the creator (Lord Brahmā); *na* — not; *anukūlaḥ* — favorably disposed; *mahā*-*īśvaraḥ* — the great Lord Śiva; *devī* — the goddess (his consort); *vā* — or; *vimukhī* — turned against; *gaurī* — Gaurī; *rudrāṇī* — the wife of Rudra; *giri*-*jā* — the adopted daughter of the Himālayan mountain range; *satī* — Satī, who, in her previous life as the daughter of Dakṣa, chose to give up her body.

### Translation

**I am extremely unfortunate, for the creator is not favorably disposed toward me, nor is the great Lord Śiva. Or perhaps Śiva’s wife, Devī, who is known as Gaurī, Rudrāṇī, Girijā and Satī, has turned against me.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that Rukmiṇī might have thought, “Even if Kṛṣṇa wanted to come, He might have been stopped on the path by the creator, Brahmā, who is not favorably inclined toward me. But why should he be unfavorable? Perhaps it is Maheśvara, Lord Śiva, whom on some occasion I did not properly worship and who thus became angry with me. But he is Maheśvara, the great controller, so why would he be angry with such an insignificant and foolish girl as me?

“Perhaps it is Śiva’s wife, Gaurīdevī, who is displeased, though I worship her every day. Alas, alas, how have I offended her so that she has turned against me? But after all, she is Rudrāṇī, the wife of Rudra, and her very name means ‘one who makes everyone cry.’ So perhaps she and Śiva want me to cry. But seeing that I am so miserable, about to give up my life, why don’t they soften their attitude? The reason must be that Goddess Devī is Girijā, an adopted daughter, so why should she be soft-hearted? In her incarnation as Satī she gave up her body, so perhaps she now wants me to give up my body also.”

Thus the *ācārya,* with realized poetic sensitivity, interprets the various names used in this verse.

*tāṁ vai pravayaso bālāṁ  
vidhi-jñā vipra-yoṣitaḥ  
bhavānīṁ vandayāṁ cakrur  
bhava-patnīṁ bhavānvitām*

### Synonyms

*tām* — her; *vai* — indeed; *pravayasaḥ* — elderly; *bālām* — the young girl; *vidhi* — of ritual injunctions; *jñāḥ* — expert knowers; *vipra* — of *brāhmaṇas*; *yoṣitaḥ* — the wives; *bhavānīm* — to Goddess Bhavānī; *vandayām* *cakruḥ* — they led in offering respects; *bhava*-*patnīm* — the wife of Bhava (Lord Siva); *bhava*-*anvitām* — accompanied by Lord Bhava.

### Translation

**The older wives of brāhmaṇas, expert in the knowledge of rituals, led young Rukmiṇī in offering respects to Bhavānī, who appeared with her consort, Lord Bhava.**

### Purport

According to the *ācāryas,* here the term *bhavānvitām* indicates that in the Ambikā temple visited by Rukmiṇī, the presiding deity was the goddess, whose husband appeared in an accompanying role. Thus the ritual was properly performed by women.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that the term *vidhi-jñāḥ* may be understood to mean that since the learned wives of *brāhmaṇas* knew of Rukmiṇī’s desire to marry Kṛṣṇa, the verb *vandayāṁ cakruḥ* thus indicates that they prompted her to pray for what she really wanted. In this way, like the goddess Bhavānī, Rukmiṇī could be united with her eternal male companion.

### Translation

**Rukmiṇī appeared as enchanting as the Lord’s illusory potency, who enchants even the sober and grave. Thus the kings gazed upon her virgin beauty, her shapely waist, and her lovely face adorned with earrings. Her hips were graced with a jewel-studded belt, her breasts were just budding, and her eyes seemed apprehensive of her encroaching locks of hair. She smiled sweetly, her jasmine-bud teeth reflecting the glow of her bimba-red lips. As she walked with the motions of a royal swan, the effulgence of her tinkling ankle bells beautified her feet. Seeing her, the assembled heroes were totally bewildered. Lust tore at their hearts. Indeed, when the kings saw her broad smile and shy glance, they became stupefied, dropped their weapons and fell unconscious to the ground from their elephants, chariots and horses. On the pretext of the procession, Rukmiṇī displayed her beauty for Kṛṣṇa alone. Slowly she advanced the two moving lotus-whorls of her feet, awaiting the arrival of the Supreme Lord. With the fingernails of her left hand she pushed some strands of hair away from her face and shyly looked from the corners of her eyes at the kings standing before her. At that moment she saw Kṛṣṇa. Then, while His enemies looked on, the Lord seized the princess, who was eager to mount His chariot.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, Rukmiṇī was anxious that her locks of hair might impede her vision, since she was most eager to see her beloved Kṛṣṇa. The nondevotees, or demons, are bewildered at seeing the opulences of the Lord and think that His potency is meant for their gross sense gratification. But Rukmiṇī, an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s internal pleasure potency, was meant for the Lord alone.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes the following verse to describe the kind of woman known as *śyāmā:*

*śīta-kāle bhaved usṇo  
uṣṇa-kāle tu śītalā  
stanau su-kaṭhinau yasyāḥ  
sā śyāmā parikīrtitā*

“A woman is called *śyāmā* when her breasts are very firm and when someone in her presence feels warm in the winter and cool in the summer.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī further points out that since the beautiful form of Rukmiṇī is a manifestation of the Lord’s internal energy, the nondevotees cannot perceive her. Thus the heroic kings assembled in Vidarbha were agitated with lust upon seeing the Lord’s illusory potency, an expansion of Rukmiṇī. In other words, no one can lust after the Lord’s eternal consort, since as soon as one’s mind is contaminated with lust, the covering of Māyā separates one from the pristine beauty of the spiritual world and its inhabitants.

Finally, Śrīmatī Rukmiṇī-devī felt shy as she looked from the corners of her eyes at the other kings, for she did not want to meet the glances of those inferior men.

**The kings inimical to the Lord, headed by Jarāsandha, could not tolerate this humiliating defeat. They exclaimed, “Oh, damn us! Though we are mighty archers, mere cowherds have stolen our honor, just as puny animals might steal the honor of lions!”**

### Purport

From the last two verses of this chapter it is clear that the perverted intelligence of demons makes them perceive things in a way exactly opposite to reality. It is clearly stated that Kṛṣṇa stole Rukmiṇī like a lion taking his prey from the midst of jackals. The demons, however, saw *themselves* as lions and Lord Kṛṣṇa as an inferior creature. Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, life becomes most dangerous.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Fifty-third Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Kṛṣṇa Kidnaps Rukmiṇī.”*
