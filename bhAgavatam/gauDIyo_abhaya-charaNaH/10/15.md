CHAPTER FIFTEEN

This chapter describes how Lord Balarāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa, while tending Their cows in the pastures of Vṛndāvana, killed Dhenukāsura, enabled the residents of Vṛndāvana to eat the fruits of the *tāla* trees and saved the young cowherds from Kāliya’s poison.

Revealing Their boyhood (*paugaṇḍa*) phase of pastimes, Rāma and Kṛṣṇa were one day bringing the cows to pasture when They entered an attractive forest decorated with a clear lake. There They began playing forest sports along with Their friends. Pretending to tire, Lord Baladeva laid His head upon the lap of a cowherd boy and rested as Lord Kṛṣṇa helped relieve His elder brother’s fatigue by massaging His feet. Then Kṛṣṇa also placed His head on the lap of a cowherd boy to rest, and another cowherd boy massaged His feet. In this way Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and Their cowherd friends enjoyed various pastimes.

During this play, Śrīdāmā, Subala, Stoka-kṛṣṇa and other cowherd boys described to Rāma and Kṛṣṇa a wicked and irrepressible demon named Dhenuka, who had assumed the form of a jackass and was living in the Tālavana forest near Govardhana Hill. This forest was full of many varieties of sweet fruits. But fearing this demon, no one dared try to relish the taste of those fruits, and thus someone had to kill the demon and all his associates. Lord Rāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa, hearing of the situation, set off for this forest to fulfill the desire of Their companions.

Arriving at the Tālavana, Lord Balarāma shook many fruits out of the palm trees, and as soon as He did so the jackass demon, Dhenuka, ran swiftly to attack Him. But Balarāma grabbed his hind legs with one hand, whirled him around and threw him into the top of a tree, thus slaying him. All of Dhenukāsura’s friends, overcome by fury, then rushed to attack, but Rāma and Kṛṣṇa took hold of them one by one, swung them around and killed them, until the disturbance was finally finished. When Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma returned to the cowherd community, Yaśodā and Rohiṇī placed Them on their respective laps. They kissed Their faces, fed Them with finely prepared food and then put Them to bed.

Some days later Lord Kṛṣṇa went with His friends, but without His older brother, to the banks of the Kālindī in order to tend the cows. The cows and cowherd boys became very thirsty and drank some water from the Kālindī. But it had been contaminated with poison, and they all fell unconscious on the riverbank. Kṛṣṇa then brought them back to life by the merciful rain of His glance, and all of them, regaining their consciousness, appreciated His great mercy.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: When Lord Rāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa attained the age of paugaṇḍa \[six to ten\] while living in Vṛndāvana, the cowherd men allowed Them to take up the task of tending the cows. Engaging thus in the company of Their friends, the two boys rendered the land of Vṛndāvana most auspicious by imprinting upon it the marks of Their lotus feet.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa wanted to encourage His cowherd boyfriends, who had been swallowed by Aghāsura and then stolen by Lord Brahmā. Therefore the Lord decided to bring them into the palm-tree forest called Tālavana, where there were many delicious ripe fruits. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa’s spiritual body had apparently grown slightly in age and strength, the senior men of Vṛndāvana, headed by Nanda Mahārāja, decided to promote Kṛṣṇa from the task of herding calves to the status of a regular cowherd boy. He would now take care of the full-grown cows, bulls and oxen. Out of great affection, Nanda Mahārāja had previously considered Kṛṣṇa too small and immature to take care of full-grown cows and bulls. It is stated in the *Kārttika-māhātmya* section of the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*śuklāṣṭamī kārttike tu  
smṛtā gopāṣṭamī budhaiḥ  
tad-dinād vāsudevo ’bhūd  
gopaḥ pūrvaṁ tu vatsapaḥ*

“The eighth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Kārttika is known by authorities as Gopāṣṭamī. From that day, Lord Vāsudeva served as a cowherd, whereas previously He had tended the calves.”

The word *padaiḥ* indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa blessed the earth by walking on her surface with His lotus feet. The Lord wore no shoes or other footgear but walked barefoot in the forest, giving great anxiety to the girls of Vṛndāvana, who feared that His soft lotus feet would be injured.

gopair gṛṇadbhiḥ sva-yaśo balānvitaḥ

### Synonyms

*tat* — thus; *mādhavaḥ* — Lord Śrī Mādhava; *veṇum* — His flute; *udīrayan* — sounding; *vṛtaḥ* — surrounded; *gopaiḥ* — by the cowherd boys; *gṛṇadbhiḥ* — who were chanting; *sva*-*yaśaḥ* — His glories; *bala*-*anvitaḥ* — accompanied by Lord Balarāma; *paśūn* — the animals; *puraskṛtya* — keeping in front; *paśavyam* — full of nourishment for the cows; *āviśat* — He entered; *vihartu*-*kāmaḥ* — desiring to enjoy pastimes; *kusuma*-*ākaram* — rich with flowers; *vanam* — the forest.

### Translation

**Thus desiring to enjoy pastimes, Lord Mādhava, sounding His flute, surrounded by cowherd boys who were chanting His glories, and accompanied by Lord Baladeva, kept the cows before Him and entered the Vṛndāvana forest, which was full of flowers and rich with nourishment for the animals.**

### Purport

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī has explained the various meanings of the word *mādhava* as follows: *Mādhava* normally indicates Kṛṣṇa to be “the Lord, who is the consort of the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī.” This name also implies that Lord Kṛṣṇa descended in the dynasty of Madhu. Since the spring season is also known as Mādhava, it is understood that as soon as Lord Kṛṣṇa entered the Vṛndāvana forest, it automatically exhibited all the opulences of spring, becoming filled with flowers, breezes and a celestial atmosphere. Another reason Lord Kṛṣṇa is known as Mādhava is that He enjoys His pastimes in *madhu,* the taste of conjugal love.

Lord Kṛṣṇa would loudly sound His flute as He entered the forest of Śrī Vṛndāvana, thus giving inconceivable bliss to all the residents of His hometown, Vraja-dhāma. These simple pastimes of playfully entering the forest, playing on the flute and so forth were performed daily in the spiritual land of Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead looked over that forest, which resounded with the charming sounds of bees, animals and birds, and which was enhanced by a lake whose clear water resembled the minds of great souls and by a breeze carrying the fragrance of hundred-petaled lotuses. Seeing all this, Lord Kṛṣṇa decided to enjoy the auspicious atmosphere.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa saw that the Vṛndāvana forest was giving pleasure to all five senses. The bees, birds, and animals made charming sounds that brought sweet pleasure to the ears. The wind was faithfully rendering service to the Lord by blowing throughout the forest, carrying the cool moisture of a transparent lake and thus giving pleasure to the sense of touch. By the sweetness of the wind, even the sense of taste was being stimulated, and the fragrance of lotus flowers was bringing pleasure to the nostrils. And the entire forest was endowed with heavenly beauty, which was giving spiritual bliss to the eyes. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has thus explained the significance of this verse.

### Translation

**The primeval Lord saw that the stately trees, with their beautiful reddish buds and their heavy burden of fruits and flowers, were bending down to touch His feet with the tips of their branches. Thus He smiled gently and addressed His elder brother.**

### Purport

The words *mudā smayann iva* indicate that Lord Kṛṣṇa was in a joking mood. He knew that the trees were actually bowing down to worship Him. But in the following verse the Lord, speaking in a friendly, lighthearted mood, gives the credit to His brother, Balarāma.

### Synonyms

The trees are offering You their fruits and flowers to eradicate the dark ignorance that has caused their birth as trees.**

### Purport

The trees of Vṛndāvana were thinking that because of past offenses they had now taken birth as trees and, being immovable, could not accompany Lord Kṛṣṇa in His wanderings throughout the Vṛndāvana area. In fact, all the creatures of Vṛndāvana, including the trees and cows, were great souls who could personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because of ecstatic sentiments of separation, the trees considered themselves in ignorance and thus tried to purify themselves by bowing down at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Lord Kṛṣṇa understanding their mentality, simultaneously glanced at them with affection and praised their devotional service before His older brother, Balarāma.

### Translation

**O Original Personality, these bees must all be great sages and most elevated devotees of Yours, for they are worshiping You by following You along the path and chanting Your glories, which are themselves a holy place for the entire world. Though You have disguised Yourself within this forest, O sinless one, they refuse to abandon You, their worshipable Lord.**

### Purport

The word *gūḍham* is significant in this verse. It indicates that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of Kṛṣṇa or Balarāma appears like an ordinary human being within the material world, great sages always recognize the Lord as the Supreme Absolute Truth. All the transcendental forms of Godhead are eternal and full of bliss and knowledge, exactly the opposite of our material bodies, which are temporary and full of misery and ignorance.

One meaning of the word *tīrtha* is “the means for crossing beyond material existence.” Simply by hearing the glories of the Supreme Lord or by chanting them, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, beyond material existence. Thus the Lord’s transcendental glories are here described as a *tīrtha* for everyone in the world. The word *gāyantaḥ* indicates that great sages give up their vows of silence and other selfish processes to glorify the activities of the Supreme Lord. Real silence means to not speak nonsense, to limit one’s verbal activities to those sounds, statements and discussions relevant to the loving service of the Supreme Lord.

The word *anagha* indicates that the Supreme Lord never performs sinful or offensive activities. The word also indicates that the Lord immediately excuses a sin or offense committed by a sincere loving devotee who may accidentally deviate from the Lord’s service. In the specific context of this verse, the word *anagha* indicates that Lord Balarāma was not disturbed by the bees who were constantly following Him (*anupatham*). The Lord blessed them by saying, “O bees, come into My confidential grove and feel free to taste its fragrance.”

### Translation

**O worshipable one, these peacocks are dancing before You out of joy, these doe are pleasing You with affectionate glances, just as the gopīs do, and these cuckoos are honoring You with Vedic prayers. All these residents of the forest are most fortunate, and their behavior toward You certainly befits great souls receiving another great soul at home.**

### Translation

**This earth has now become most fortunate, because You have touched her grass and bushes with Your feet and her trees and creepers with Your fingernails, and because You have graced her rivers, mountains, birds and animals with Your merciful glances. But above all, You have embraced the young cowherd women between Your two arms — a favor hankered after by the goddess of fortune herself.**

### Purport

The word *adya,* “now,” indicates the time of Lord Balarāma and Lord Kṛṣṇa’s appearance on the earth. In His form of Varāha, Lord Kṛṣṇa personally saved the earth, and, indeed, the earth is understood to rest perpetually on the potency of Śeṣa. Both Varāha and Śeṣa are expansions of Balarāma, who is Himself an expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the original Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statement that “this earth has now become most fortunate” (*dhanyeyam adya dharaṇī*) indicates that nothing can equal the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His personal form as Kṛṣṇa, appearing simultaneously with His plenary expansion, Balarāma. The compound word *karajābhimṛṣṭāḥ,* “touched by Your fingernails,” indicates that as Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would move through the forest They would pick fruits and flowers from the trees, bushes and creepers and use this paraphernalia in Their pleasure pastimes. Sometimes They would break leaves off the plants and use them with the flowers to decorate Their bodies.

Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would glance lovingly and mercifully at all the rivers, hills and creatures in Vṛndāvana. But the blessing received by the gopīs — being embraced directly between the Lord’s arms — was the supreme benediction, desired even by the goddess of fortune herself. The goddess of fortune, who lives in Vaikuṇṭha on the chest of Lord Nārāyaṇa, once desired to be embraced on the chest of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus she performed severe austerities to achieve this blessing. Śrī Kṛṣṇa informed her that her actual place was in Vaikuṇṭha and that it was not possible for her to dwell upon His chest in Vṛndāvana. Therefore she begged Kṛṣṇa to allow her to remain on His chest in the form of a golden line, and He granted her this benediction. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura recounts this incident from the *Purāṇas.*

### Translation

**Sometimes the honeybees in Vṛndāvana became so mad with ecstasy that they closed their eyes and began to sing. Lord Kṛṣṇa, moving along the forest path with His cowherd boyfriends and Baladeva, would then respond to the bees by imitating their singing while His friends sang about His pastimes. Sometimes Lord Kṛṣṇa would imitate the chattering of a parrot, sometimes, with a sweet voice, the call of a cuckoo, and sometimes the cooing of swans. Sometimes He vigorously imitated the dancing of a peacock, making His cowherd boyfriends laugh. Sometimes, with a voice as deep as the rumbling of clouds, He would call out with great affection the names of the animals who had wandered far from the herd, thus enchanting the cows and the cowherd boys.**

### Purport

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī explains that Lord Kṛṣṇa would joke with His friends, saying, “Just look, this peacock does not know how to dance properly,” whereupon the Lord would vigorously imitate the peacock’s dancing, causing great laughter among His friends. The bees in Vṛndāvana would drink the sap of the forest flowers, and the combination of this nectar and the association of Śrī Kṛṣṇa made them mad with intoxication. Thus they closed their eyes in ecstasy and expressed their satisfaction by humming. And this humming was also expertly imitated by the Lord.

Actually, in Vṛndāvana, the abode of the Lord, the lions and tigers are not violent, and thus there is no reason to fear them.

*asti govardhanaṁ nāma  
kṣetraṁ parama-durlabham  
mathurā-paścime bhāge  
adūrād yojana-dvayam*

“Not far from the western side of Mathurā, at a distance of two *yojanas* \[sixteen miles\], is the holy place named Govardhana, which is most difficult to attain.” It is also stated in the *Varāha Purāṇa:*

*asti tāla-vanaṁ nāma  
dhenakāsura-rakṣitam  
mathurā-paścime bhāge  
adūrād eka-yojanam*

“Not far from the western side of Mathurā, one *yojana* away \[eight miles\], is the forest known as Tālavana, which was guarded by Dhenukāsura.” Thus it appears that the Tālavana forest is located midway between Mathurā and Govardhana Hill. The forest of Tālavana is described in the *Śrī Hari-vaṁśa* as follows:

*sa tu deśaḥ samaḥ snigdhaḥ  
su-mahān kṛṣṇa-mṛttikaḥ  
darbha-prāyaḥ sthulī-bhūto  
loṣṭra-pāṣāṇa-varjitaḥ*

“The land there is even, smooth and very expansive. The earth is black, densely covered with *darbha* grass and devoid of stones and pebbles.”

### Purport

The cowherd boyfriends of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma encouraged the two brothers to go at once to the Tāla forest and kill the ass demon. Indeed, here they address the brothers as *amitra-han,* “killer of the enemy.” The cowherd boys were engaged in ecstatic meditation upon the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and reasoned thus: “Kṛṣṇa has already killed terrible demons like Baka and Agha, so what is so special about this obnoxious jackass named Dhenuka, who has become public enemy number one in Vṛndāvana?”

The cowherd boys wanted Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to kill the demons so that all the pious inhabitants of Vṛndāvana could enjoy the fruits in the Tāla forest. Thus they requested the special favor that the ass demons be killed.

This easterly wind generally blows in the month of Bhādra and thus indicates the excellent ripeness of the fruits, while the fact that the boys could smell them indicates the nearness of the Tāla forest.

### Purport

Although neither man nor bird nor beast could even approach the Tāla forest, the cowherd boys had so much faith in Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma that they took it for granted the two Lords could effortlessly kill the sinful ass demons and acquire the delicious *tāla* fruits. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s cowherd boyfriends are exalted, self-realized souls who would not ordinarily become greedy for sweet fruits. In fact, they are simply joking with the Lord and enthusing His pastimes, urging Him to perform unprecedented heroic feats in the Tāla forest. Innumerable demons disturbed the sublime atmosphere of Vṛndāvana during Lord Kṛṣṇa’s presence there, and the Lord would kill such demons as a popular daily event.

Since Lord Kṛṣṇa had already killed many demons, on this particular day He decided to give first honors to Lord Balarāma, who would demolish the first demon, Dhenuka. By the words *yadi rocate,* the cowherd boys indicate that Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma need not kill the demon simply to satisfy them; rather, They should do so only if the Lords Themselves found the concept appealing.

### Translation

**Hearing the words of Their dear companions, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma laughed and, desiring to please them, set off for the Tālavana surrounded by Their cowherd boyfriends.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa was thinking, “How can a mere ass be so formidable?” And thus He smiled at the petition of His boyfriends. As stated by Lord Kapila in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.28.32), *hāsaṁ harer avanatākhila-loka-tīvra-śokāśru-sāgara-viśoṣaṇam aty-udāram:* “The smile and laughter of the Supreme Lord Hari is most magnanimous. Indeed, for those who bow down to the Lord, His smile and laughter dry up the ocean of tears caused by the intense suffering of this world.” Thus, to encourage Their boyfriends, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Balarāma smiled, laughed and immediately set out with them for the Tāla forest.

Indeed, the entire cosmos rests upon Him just as a woven cloth rests upon its own horizontal and vertical threads.**

### Purport

Unfortunate persons cannot appreciate the blissful pastimes of the Supreme Lord. In this connection Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that the Supreme Lord possesses unlimited potency and strength, as expressed here by the word *anante.* The Lord exhibits a tiny fraction of His power according to the need of a particular situation. Lord Balarāma desired to vanquish the gang of demoniac asses who had unlawfully seized the Tālavana forest, and therefore He exhibited just enough divine opulence to easily kill Dhenukāsura and the other demons.

### Translation

**The other ass demons, close friends of Dhenukāsura, were enraged upon seeing his death, and thus they all immediately ran to attack Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma.**

### Purport

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī makes the following comment on this verse: “It is stated here that the ass demons first attacked Kṛṣṇa and then Balarāma (*kṛṣṇaṁ ca rāmaṁ ca*). One reason for this is that the demons, having seen the prowess of Lord Balarāma, thought it wise to attack Kṛṣṇa first. Or it may be that out of affection for His elder brother, Lord Kṛṣṇa placed Himself between Balarāma and the ass demons. The words *kṛṣṇaṁ ca rāmaṁ ca* may also be understood to indicate that Lord Balarāma, out of affection for His younger brother, went to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s side.

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the bodies of the demons were dark, like dark blue clouds, and the large quantity of blood that had flowed from their bodies appeared like bright red clouds. Thus the whole scene was very beautiful. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms, such as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, is always transcendental, and when He enacts His transcendental pastimes the result is always beautiful and transcendental, even when the Lord performs violent acts like killing the stubborn ass demons.

The gopīs, all together, came forward to meet Him, their eyes very eager to see Him.**

### Purport

Superficially, the *gopīs* were young married girls, and therefore they would naturally be ashamed and fearful of casting loving glances at a beautiful young boy like Śrī Kṛṣṇa. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all living beings are His eternal servants. Thus the *gopīs,* although the most pure-hearted of all great souls, did not hesitate to come forward and satisfy their love-struck eyes by drinking in the sight of beautiful young Kṛṣṇa. The *gopīs* also relished the sweet sound of His flute and the enchanting fragrance of His body.

### Synonyms

*pītvā* — drinking; *mukunda*-*mukha* — of the face of Lord Mukunda; *sāragham* — the honey; *akṣi*-*bhṛṅgaiḥ* — with their beelike eyes; *tāpam* — distress; *jahuḥ* — gave up; *viraha*-*jam* — based on separation; *vraja*-*yoṣitaḥ* — the ladies of Vṛndāvana; *ahni* — during the day; *tat* — that; *sat*-*kṛtim* — offering of respect; *samadhigamya* — fully accepting; *viveśa* — He entered; *goṣṭham* — the cowherd village; *sa*-*vrīḍa* — with shame; *hāsa* — laughter; *vinayam* — and humbleness; *yat* — which; *apāṅga* — of their sidelong glances; *mokṣam* — the release.

### Translation

**With their beelike eyes, the women of Vṛndāvana drank the honey of the beautiful face of Lord Mukunda, and thus they gave up the distress they had felt during the day because of separation from Him. The young Vṛndāvana ladies cast sidelong glances at the Lord — glances filled with bashfulness, laughter and submission — and Śrī Kṛṣṇa, completely accepting these glances as a proper offering of respect, entered the cowherd village.**

### Purport

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda describes this incident as follows: “All the *gopīs* in Vṛndāvana remained very morose on account of Kṛṣṇa’s absence. All day they were thinking of Kṛṣṇa in the forest or of Him herding cows in the pasture. When they saw Kṛṣṇa returning, all their anxieties were immediately relieved, and they began to look at His face the way drones hover over the honey of the lotus flower. When Kṛṣṇa entered the village, the young *gopīs* smiled and laughed. Kṛṣṇa, while playing the flute, enjoyed the beautiful smiling faces of the *gopīs.”*

The Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme master of romantic skills, and thus He expertly exchanged loving feelings with the young cowherd girls of Vṛndāvana. When a chaste young girl is in love, she glances at her beloved with shyness, jubilation and submission. When the beloved accepts her offering of love by receiving her glance and is thus satisfied with her, the loving young girl’s heart becomes filled with happiness. These were exactly the romantic exchanges taking place between beautiful young Kṛṣṇa and the loving cowherd girls of Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**Mother Yaśodā and mother Rohiṇī, acting most affectionately toward their two sons, offered all the best things to Them in response to Their every desire and at the various appropriate times.**

### Purport

The word *paramāśiṣaḥ* indicates the attractive blessings of a loving mother, which include wonderful food, beautiful clothes, jewelry, toys and constant affection. The words *yathā-kāmaṁ yathā-kālam* indicate that although Yaśodā and Rohiṇī satisfied all the desires of their sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, they also properly regulated the boys’ activities. In other words, they prepared wonderful food for their children, but they saw to it that the boys ate at the proper time. Similarly, their children would play at the proper time and sleep at the proper time. The word *yathā-kāmam* does not indicate that the mothers indiscriminately allowed the boys to do whatever They liked, but in the proper, civilized way they showered their blessings upon their children.

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī comments that the mothers loved their sons so much that as they embraced Them they would carefully check all Their limbs to see if They were healthy and strong.
