CHAPTER EIGHTY-ONE

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa ate a morsel of the flat rice brought by His friend Sudāmā and bestowed upon him wealth greater than that of the King of heaven.

In the course of His loving talks with His friend Sudāmā, Lord Kṛṣṇa said, “My dear *brāhmaṇa,* have you brought any gift for Me from home? I regard as very significant even the smallest offering from My loving devotee.” But the poor *brāhmaṇa* was ashamed to present Kṛṣṇa with his meager gift of flat rice. However, since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supersoul dwelling in all hearts, He knew why Sudāmā had come to visit Him. So He grabbed the bundle of flat rice Sudāmā was hiding and ate a handful of it with great pleasure. He was about to eat a second morsel when Rukmiṇī devī stopped Him.

Feeling as if he had gone back to Godhead, Sudāmā spent that night comfortably in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s palace, and the next morning he set off for home. As he passed along the highway, he thought of how fortunate he was to have been so honored by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Absorbed in this meditation, Sudāmā arrived at the place where his home used to be — and he was struck with great wonder. Instead of his broken-down hovel, he saw a series of opulent palaces. While he stood astonished, a group of beautiful men and women came forward to greet him with singing and music. The *brāhmaṇa’s* wife, wonderfully adorned with celestial jewelry, came out of the palace and welcomed him with great love and reverence. Sudāmā entered his home together with her, thinking that this extraordinary transformation must have been due to the Supreme Lord’s mercy on him.

From then on Sudāmā lived his life amidst lavish wealth, yet he maintained his mood of detachment and constantly chanted the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa In a short time he broke off all bonds of bodily attachment and attained to the kingdom of God.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī said:\] Lord Hari, Kṛṣṇa, perfectly knows the hearts of all living beings, and He is especially devoted to the brāhmaṇas. While the Supreme Lord, the goal of all saintly persons, conversed in this way with the best of the twice-born, He laughed and spoke the following words to that dear friend of His, the brāhmaṇa Sudāmā, all the while smiling and looking upon him with affection.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the words *sarva-bhūta-mano-’bhijña* indicate that since Lord Kṛṣṇa knows the minds of everyone, He could tell at once that His friend Sudāmā had brought some flat rice for Him and was ashamed to present it. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī’s further explanation of this verse, Lord Kṛṣṇa smiled at this moment, thinking “Yes, I am going to make you show what you brought for Me.” His smile then turned to laughter as He thought, “How long are you going to keep this precious gift hidden in your cloth?”

Kṛṣṇa glanced toward the bundle hidden inside His friend’s garment, telling Sudāmā by His loving glance, “The veins showing through your emaciated skin and your ragged clothes astonish everyone present, but these symptoms of poverty will last only until tomorrow morning.”

Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is Bhagavān, the supreme, independent Lord, He is always pleased to reciprocate with those who are *priya,* His cherished servants. As the indulgent patron of the *brāhmaṇa* class, He especially enjoys favoring *brāhmaṇas* who are additionally qualified by unconditional devotion to Him.

पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति ।

### Verse text

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ  
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam  
aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*patram* — a leaf; *puṣpam* — a flower; *phalam* — a fruit; *toyam* — water; *yaḥ* — whoever; *me* — unto Me; *bhaktyā* — with devotion; *prayacchati* — offers; *tat* — that; *aham* — I; *bhakti*-*upahṛtam* — offered in devotion; *aśnāmi* — accept; *prayata*-*ātmanaḥ* — from one in pure consciousness.

### Translation

**If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, I will accept it.**

### Purport

These famous words are also spoken by the Lord in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26); the translation and word meanings here are taken from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s *Bhagavad-gītā* *As It Is.*

In the context of the current episode of Sudāmā’s visit to Dvārakā, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has kindly continued his explanation of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statements: This verse is a reply to Sudāmā’s anxiety that his bringing such an unfit offering was ill-considered. The use of the words *bhaktyā prayacchati* and *bhakty-upahṛtam* may seem redundant, since they both mean “offered with devotion,” but *bhaktyā* can indicate how the Lord reciprocates the devotional mood of whoever offers Him something with love. In other words, Lord Kṛṣṇa here declares that His reciprocation in a pure loving exchange is not dependent on the external quality of what is offered. Kṛṣṇa says, “Something may or may not be impressive and pleasing in its own right, but when My devotee offers it to Me in devotion, with the expectation that I will enjoy it, it gives Me great pleasure; in this regard I make no discrimination.” The verb *aśnāmi,* “I eat,” implies that Lord Kṛṣṇa eats even a flower, which is supposed to be smelled, bewildered as He is by the ecstatic love He feels for His devotee.

Someone might then question the Lord, “So, will You refuse an offering made to You by a devotee of some other deity?” The Lord answers, “Yes, I will refuse to eat it.” This the Lord states by the phrase *prayatātmanaḥ,* implying “Only by devotional service to Me can one become pure in heart.”

### Verse text

*ity ukto ’pi dviyas tasmai  
vrīḍitaḥ pataye śriyaḥ  
pṛthuka-prasṛtiṁ rājan  
na prāyacchad avāṅ-mukhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*iti* — thus; *uktaḥ* — addressed; *api* — although; *dvijaḥ* — the *brāhmaṇa*; *tasmai* — to Him; *vrīḍitaḥ* — embarrassed; *pataye* — to the husband; *śriyaḥ* — of the goddess of fortune; *pṛthuka* — of flat rice; *prasṛtim* — the palmfuls; *rājan* — O King (Parīkṣit); *na* *prāyacchat* — did not offer; *avāk* — bowed down; *mukhaḥ* — whose head.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Even after being addressed in this way, O King, the brāhmaṇa felt too embarrassed to offer his palmfuls of flat rice to the husband of the goddess of fortune. He simply kept his head bowed in shame.**

### Purport

According to Ācārya Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the description here of Kṛṣṇa as “the husband of the goddess of fortune” implies that Sudāmā questioned himself, “How can the Lord of Śrī eat this hard, stale rice?” By bowing his head, the *brāhmaṇa* revealed his meditation: “My dear master, please do not make me ashamed. Even if You request it from me repeatedly, I will not give this to You. I have made up my mind.” But the Lord countered with His own thought: “The intention you had fixed in your mind while coming here must not be frustrated, for you are My devotee.”

### Translation

**Being the direct witness in the hearts of all living beings, Lord Kṛṣṇa fully understood why Sudāmā had come to see Him. Thus He thought, “In the past My friend has never worshiped Me out of a desire for material opulence, but now he comes to Me to satisfy his chaste and devoted wife. I will give him riches that even the immortal demigods cannot obtain.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that the Lord momentarily wondered, “How has it come about, despite My omniscience, that this devotee of Mine has fallen into such poverty?” Then, quickly understanding the situation, He spoke to Himself the words related in this verse.

But someone may point out that Sudāmā should not have been so poverty-stricken, since appropriate enjoyment comes as a by-product of service to God even for a devotee who has no ulterior motives. This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.22):

*ananyāś cintayanto māṁ  
ye janāḥ paryupāsate  
teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ  
yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham*

“But those who always worship Me with exclusive devotion, meditating on My transcendental form — to them I carry what they lack, and I preserve what they have.”

In response to this point, a distinction must be made between two kinds of renounced devotees: one kind is inimical to sense gratification, and the other is indifferent to it. The Supreme Lord does not force sense gratification upon the devotee who is extremely averse to worldly enjoyments. This is seen among such great renouncers as Jaḍa Bharata. On the other hand, the Lord may give limitless wealth and power to a devotee who is neither repelled nor attracted by material things, such as Prahlāda Mahārāja. Up to this point in his life, Sudāmā Brāhmaṇa was totally averse to sense gratification, but now, out of compassion for his faithful wife — and also because he hankered to have Kṛṣṇa’s audience — he went to beg from the Lord.

As watering the root of a tree immediately distributes water to every part of the tree, so an offering made to Kṛṣṇa, or any action done for Kṛṣṇa, is to be considered the highest welfare work for everyone, because the benefit of such an offering is distributed throughout the creation. Love for Kṛṣṇa becomes distributed to all living entities.”

### Translation

**After saying this, the Supreme Lord ate one palmful and was about to eat a second when the devoted goddess Rukmiṇī took hold of His hand.**

### Purport

Queen Rukmiṇī took hold of Kṛṣṇa’s hand to prevent Him from eating any more of the flat rice. According to Śrīpāda Śrīdhara Svāmī, with this gesture she meant to tell the Lord, “This much of Your grace is sufficient to assure anyone vast riches, which are merely the play of my glance. But please do not force me to surrender myself to this *brāhmaṇa,* as will happen if You eat one more handful.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that by taking hold of the Lord’s hand Rukmiṇī implied, “If You eat all of this wonderful treat Your friend brought from his house, what will I have left for my friends, co-wives, servants and myself? There will not be enough left to distribute even one grain to each of us.” And to her maidservant companions she said by her gesture, “This hard rice will upset my Lord’s tender stomach.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda comments that “when food is offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa with love and devotion and He is pleased and accepts it from the devotee, Rukmiṇīdevī, the goddess of fortune, becomes so greatly obliged to the devotee that she has to go personally to the devotee’s home to turn it into the most opulent home in the world. If one feeds Nārāyaṇa sumptuously, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, automatically becomes a guest in one’s house, which means that one’s home becomes opulent.”

### Translation

**The next day, Sudāmā set off for home while being honored by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the self-satisfied maintainer of the universe. The brāhmaṇa felt greatly delighted, my dear King, as he walked along the road.**

### Purport

We are here reminded that Lord Kṛṣṇa maintains the supply of desirable objects for the whole universe. Therefore it is to be understood that He was about to manifest for Sudāmā opulence greater than Indra’s. Being *sva-sukha,* perfectly complete in His own bliss, the Lord has an unlimited capacity for bestowing gifts.

According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the word *abhivanditaḥ* indicates that Śrī Kṛṣṇa accompanied Sudāmā on the road for a short distance and finally parted with the *brāhmaṇa* after bowing down to him and speaking some respectful words.

### Translation

**Who am I? A sinful, poor friend of a brāhmaṇa. And who is Kṛṣṇa? The Supreme Personality of Godhead, full in six opulences. Nonetheless, He has embraced me with His two arms.**

### Purport

This translation is from Śrīla Prabhupāda’s English rendering of *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 7.143).

Sudāmā was so humble that he considered his poverty to be his own fault, a result of sin. Such a mentality is in accord with the saying, *dāridrya-doṣo guṇa-rāśi-nāśī:* “The discrepancy of being poor ruins heaps of good qualities.”

### Purport

Sudāmā’s statement that Lord Kṛṣṇa bestowed on him “not even a little wealth” may also be taken to mean that instead of giving him wealth that was *abhuri,* “slight,” the Lord in fact gave him the immense treasure of His association. This alternate meaning has been suggested by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Thinking thus to himself, Sudāmā finally came to the place where his home stood. But that place was now crowded on all sides with towering, celestial palaces rivaling the combined brilliance of the sun, fire and the moon. There were splendorous courtyards and gardens, each filled with flocks of cooing birds and beautified by ponds in which kumuda, ambhoja, kahlāra and utpala lotuses grew. Finely attired men and doe-eyed women stood in attendance. Sudāmā wondered, “What is all this? Whose property is it? How has this all come about?”**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī gives the sequence of the *brāhmaṇa’s* thoughts: First, seeing a great, unfamiliar effulgence, he thought, “What is this?” Then, noting the palaces, he asked himself, “Whose place is this?” And recognizing it as his own, he wondered, “How has it become so transformed?”

### Purport

As explained by Ācārya Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the word *pratyagṛhṇan* (“they acknowledged in turn”) indicates that first Sudāmā accepted the servants within his mind, deciding “My Lord must want me to have them,” and in response to the visible change in his attitude, they approached him as their master.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds this insight: The night before, Sudāmā’s poor, emaciated wife had been sleeping in rags under a crumbling roof, but when she woke in the morning she found herself and her house wonderfully changed. Only for a moment was she confused; she then realized that this opulence was the Lord’s gift to her husband, who must be on his way home. Thus she prepared to greet him.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that Sudāmā was simply astonished at the sight of his wife. As he wondered, “Who is this demigod’s wife who has approached such a fallen soul as me?” the maidservants informed him, “This is indeed your wife.” At that very moment Sudāmā’s body became young and beautiful, bedecked in fine clothing and jewelry. The word *prītaḥ* here indicates that these changes gave him considerable pleasure.

The famous “Thousand Names of Viṣṇu” hymn of the *Mahābhārata* immortalizes Sudāmā’s sudden opulence in the following phrase: *śrīdāmā-raṅka-bhaktārtha-bhūmy-ānītendra-vaibhavaḥ.* “Lord Viṣṇu is also known as He who brought Indra’s opulence to this earth for the benefit of His pitiful devotee Śrīdāmā \[Sudāmā\].”

Upon the walls of sparkling crystal glass, inlaid with precious emeralds, shone jeweled lamps, and the women in the palace were all adorned with precious gems. As he viewed this luxurious opulence of all varieties, the brāhmaṇa calmly reasoned to himself about his unexpected prosperity.**

### Translation

**After all, my friend Kṛṣṇa, the most exalted of the Dāśārhas and the enjoyer of unlimited wealth, noticed that I secretly intended to beg from Him. Thus even though He said nothing about it when I stood before Him, He actually bestowed upon me the most abundant riches. In this way He acted just like a merciful rain cloud.**

### Purport

Śrī Kṛṣṇa is *bhūri-bhoja,* the unlimited enjoyer. He did not tell Sudāmā how He was going to fulfill his unspoken request because, according to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, He was thinking at the time, “My dear friend has given Me these grains of rice, which are greater than all the treasures I own. Even though in his own house he had no such gift to bring Me, he took the trouble of begging it from a neighbor. Therefore it is only proper that I give him something more valuable than all My possessions. But nothing is equal to or greater than what I possess, so all I can do is give him such meager things as the treasures of Indra, Brahmā and other demigods.” Embarrassed at being unable to properly reciprocate His devotee’s offering, Lord Kṛṣṇa bestowed His favor on the *brāhmaṇa* silently. The Lord acted just like a magnanimous rain cloud which provides the necessities of life for everyone near and far but feels ashamed that its rain is too insignificant a gift to give in return for the abundant offerings that farmers make to it. Out of shame the cloud may wait until nighttime, when the farmers are asleep, before watering their fields.

The chiefs of the Dāśārha clan, with whom Lord Kṛṣṇa is identified in this verse, were especially renowned for their generosity.

### Translation

**To a devotee who lacks spiritual insight, the Supreme Lord will not grant the wonderful opulences of this world — kingly power and material assets. Indeed, in His infinite wisdom the unborn Lord well knows how the intoxication of pride can cause the downfall of the wealthy.**

### Purport

As explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the humble *brāhmaṇa* Sudāmā considered himself unworthy of the Supreme Lord’s most rare and valuable benediction, pure devotional service. He reasoned that if he had any true devotion, the Lord would have granted him perfect, unflinching devotion rather than the material riches and servants he had received. Lord Kṛṣṇa would have protected a more serious devotee by denying him such distractions. The Lord will give a sincere but less intelligent devotee not as much material wealth as he desires, but only what will promote his devotional progress. Sudāmā thought, “A great saint like Prahlāda Mahārāja can avoid becoming contaminated by immeasurable wealth, power and fame, but I must always be wary of temptation in my new situation.”

We may understand that this humble attitude assured Sudāmā Vipra final success in his execution of *bhakti-yoga* by the standard process of hearing and repeating the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

### Purport

Sudāmā’s earthly fortune has been described, and now Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes the treasure the *brāhmaṇa* enjoyed in the next world. Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī mentions that Sudāmā’s last trace of illusion lay in the subtle pride of being a renounced *brāhmaṇa.* This trace was also destroyed by his contemplating the Supreme Lord’s submission to His devotees.

### Purport

In the introduction to the chapter of *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead* that describes this pastime, His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda comments: “Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all living entities, knows everyone’s heart very well. He is especially inclined to the *brāhmaṇa* devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa is also called *brahmaṇya-deva,* which means that He is worshiped by the *brāhmaṇas.* Therefore it is understood that a devotee who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead has already acquired the position of a *brāhmaṇa.* Without becoming a *brāhmaṇa,* one cannot approach the Supreme Brahman, Lord Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is especially concerned with vanquishing the distress of His devotees, and He is the only shelter of pure devotees.”

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Eighty-first Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Lord Blesses Sudāmā Brāhmaṇa.”*
