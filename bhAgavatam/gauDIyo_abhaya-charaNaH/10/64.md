CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR

This chapter describes how Śrī Kṛṣṇa released King Nṛga from a curse and instructed the royal order on the great danger of taking a *brāhmaṇa’s* property.

One day Sāmba and other young boys of the Yādava dynasty went to the forest to play, and after playing for a long time they became very thirsty and began looking for water. Inside a dry well they found an amazing creature: a huge lizard resembling a hill. The boys felt sorry for it and tried to pull it out. But after several attempts with leather thongs and ropes, they saw that they would not be able to rescue the creature, and thus they went to Lord Kṛṣṇa and told Him what had happened. The Lord accompanied them to the well and, extending His left hand, easily lifted the lizard out. By the touch of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s hand the creature transformed at once into a demigod. Then Lord Kṛṣṇa asked, “Who are you, and how did you assume such a lowly form?”

The divine being replied, “My name was King Nṛga, son of Ikṣvāku, and I was famous for giving charity. Indeed, I gave away countless cows to numerous *brāhmaṇas.* But on one occasion a cow belonging to a first-class *brāhmaṇa* wandered into my herd. Unaware of this, I gave this cow in charity to a different *brāhmaṇa.* When the cow’s previous owner saw the second *brāhmaṇa* taking this cow away, the first *brāhmaṇa* claimed the cow as his and began arguing with the second *brāhmaṇa.* After quarreling for some time they approached me, and I implored them to each take one hundred thousand cows in exchange for that one cow, and to please forgive me for the offense I had unknowingly committed. But neither *brāhmaṇa* would accept my proposal, and the matter remained unsettled.

“Shortly thereafter I died and was taken by the Yamadūtas to the court of Yamarāja. Yama asked me which I preferred to do first: suffer the results of my sins or enjoy the results of my pious acts. I decided to suffer my sinful reactions first, and thus I assumed the body of a lizard.”

After King Nṛga had told his story, he offered prayers to Lord Kṛṣṇa and then mounted a celestial airplane, which transported him to heaven.

Lord Kṛṣṇa then instructed His personal associates, as well as the general mass of people, on the dangers of stealing a *brāhmaṇa’s* property. Finally, the Lord returned to His palace.

Please save me from this difficult situation, or I’ll surely fall into a filthy hell.”**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī comments on this verse as follows: “Since King Nṛga openly declared that he had two outstanding qualities — namely devotion to the *brāhmaṇas,* and generosity — it is clear that he possessed these qualities only partially, since someone who is truly pure would not boast about them. It is also clear that King Nṛga considered such piety to be a separate goal, desirable for its own sake. Thus he did not fully appreciate pure devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa had not been the only goal of Nṛga’s life, as He was for Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, even in the stage of regulative practice. Nor do we find that King Nṛga overcame obstacles like those Ambarīṣa did when Durvāsā Muni became angry at him. Still, we can conclude that since Nṛga was able to see the Lord for some reason or another, he must have had the good quality of sincerely desiring the Lord’s association.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda confirms the above analysis in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead:* “On the whole, \[Nṛga\] had not developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person develops love of God, Kṛṣṇa, not love for pious or impious activities; therefore he is not subjected to the results of such action. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā,* a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, does not become subjected to the resultant reactions of fruitive activities.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī offers the following commentary: “When Nṛga mentioned ‘one who hankered to have Your audience,’ he was referring to an incident concerning a certain great devotee King Nṛga had once met. This devotee was very eager to acquire a temple for a most beautiful Deity of the Supreme Lord, and he also wanted copies of such scriptures as the *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Being very generous, Nṛga arranged for these things, and the devotee was so satisfied that he blessed the King: ‘My dear King, may you have the audience of the Supreme Lord.’ From that time on, Nṛga desired to see the Lord.”

### Translation

**O almighty one, how is it that my eyes see You here before me? You are the Supreme Soul, whom the greatest masters of mystic yoga can meditate upon within their pure hearts only by employing the spiritual eye of the Vedas. Then how, O transcendental Lord, are You directly visible to me, since my intelligence has been blinded by the severe tribulations of material life? Only one who has finished his material entanglement in this world should be able to see You.**

### Purport

Even in the body of a lizard, King Nṛga could remember his previous life. And now that he had the opportunity to see the Lord, he could understand that he had received special mercy from the Personality of Godhead.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows on this verse: His faith emboldened upon receiving the Lord’s mercy and thus attaining the status of servitude, King Nṛga properly glorifies the Lord by chanting His names and then asks the Lord’s permission to take his leave. The spirit of his prayer is as follows: “You are Devadeva, God even of the gods, and Jagannātha, the master of the universe, so please be my master. O Govinda, please make me Your property with the same merciful glance You use to enchant the cows. You can do this because You are Puruṣottama, the supreme form of Godhead. O Nārāyaṇa, since You are the foundation of the living entities, please be my support, even though I am a bad living entity. O Hṛṣīkeśa, please make my senses Your own. O Puṇyaśloka, now You have become famous as the deliverer of Nṛga. O Acyuta, please never be lost to my mind. O Avyaya, You will never diminish in my mind.” Thus the great *Bhāgavatam* commentator Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains the purport of these verses.

### Translation

**I offer my repeated obeisances unto You, Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva. You are the source of all beings, the Supreme Absolute Truth, the possessor of unlimited potencies, the master of all spiritual disciplines.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī comments that King Nṛga here offers his obeisances to Brahman — that is, the Absolute Truth — who is unchanged in spite of performing activities. Since ancient times, Western philosophers have puzzled over the question of how God can be unchanging and yet perform activities. Śrīdhara Svāmī states that this doubt is answered here by the term *ananta-śaktaye,* which describes the Lord as “the possessor of unlimited potency.” Thus through the Lord’s infinite potencies He can perform innumerable activities without changing His essential nature.

The King further offers his obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the possessor of the form of eternal bliss and the supreme goal of life. The holy name of Kṛṣṇa is analyzed in a verse from the *Mahābhārata* (*Udyoga-parva* 71.4), which is quoted in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 9.30):

*kṛṣir bhū-vācakaḥ śabdo  
ṇaś ca nirvṛti-vācakaḥ  
tayor aikyaṁ paraṁ brahma  
kṛṣṇa ity abhidhīyate*

“The word *kṛṣ* is the attractive feature of the Lord’s existence, and *na* means ‘spiritual pleasure.’ When the verb *kṛṣ* is added to *na,* it becomes *kṛṣṇa,* which indicates the Absolute Truth.”

King Nṛga offers the above prayers as he is about to leave the personal association of the Supreme Lord.
