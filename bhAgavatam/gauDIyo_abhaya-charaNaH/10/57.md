CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN

This chapter describes how Lord Kṛṣṇa, after the murder of Satrājit, killed Śatadhanvā and had Akrūra bring the Syamantaka jewel back to Dvārakā.

When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa heard that the Pāṇḍavas had supposedly been burned to death in the palace of lac, He went to Hastināpura with Lord Baladeva to maintain the principles of worldly protocol, even though, being omniscient, He knew the report was false. With Kṛṣṇa out of Dvārakā, Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā incited Śatadhanvā to steal the Syamantaka jewel from Satrājit. Bewildered by their words, the sinful Śatadhanvā murdered King Satrājit in his sleep and stole the gem. Queen Satyabhāmā was overcome with grief at the death of her father, and she rushed to Hastināpura to report the sorrowful news to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Together with Lord Baladeva, Kṛṣṇa then returned to Dvārakā to kill Śatadhanvā.

Śatadhanvā went to Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā to beg for help, but when they refused he left the jewel with Akrūra and fled for his life. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma pursued him, and Lord Kṛṣṇa beheaded him with His sharp-edged disc. When the Lord could not find the Syamantaka jewel on Śatadhanvā’s person, Baladeva told Him that Śatadhanvā must have left it in someone’s care. Baladeva further suggested that Kṛṣṇa return to Dvārakā to find the jewel while He, Baladeva, would take the opportunity to visit the King of Videha. Thus Lord Balarāma traveled to Mithilā and remained there for a few years, during which He taught King Duryodhana the art of fighting with a club.

Lord Kṛṣṇa returned to Dvārakā and had the funeral rites performed for Satrājit. When Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā heard how Śatadhanvā had met his death, they fled Dvārakā. Soon many kinds of disturbances — mental, physical and so on — began to afflict Dvārakā, and the citizens concluded that the cause of these troubles must be Akrūra’s exile. The city elders explained, “Once there was a drought in Benares, and the king of the region gave his daughter in marriage to Akrūra’s father, who was visiting Benares at the time. As a result of this gift, the drought ended.” The elders, thinking Akrūra had the same power as his father, declared that Akrūra should be brought back.

Lord Kṛṣṇa knew that Akrūra’s exile was not the main cause of the disturbances. Still, He had Akrūra brought back to Dvārakā, and after properly honoring him with worship and greeting him with sweet words, Kṛṣṇa told him, “I know Śatadhanvā left the jewel in your care. Since Satrājit had no sons, his daughter’s offspring are the just claimants to whatever property he has left behind. Nonetheless, it would be best for you to keep the troublesome jewel in your care. Just let Me show it once to My relatives.” Akrūra presented Kṛṣṇa with the jewel, which shone as brilliantly as the sun, and after the Lord had shown it to His family members He returned it to Akrūra.

*śrī*-*bādarāyaṇiḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the son of Badarāyaṇa, said; *vijñāta* — aware; *arthaḥ* — of the facts; *api* — although; *govindaḥ* — Lord Kṛṣṇa; *dagdhān* — burned to death; *ākarṇya* — hearing; *pāṇḍavān* — the sons of Pāṇḍu; *kuntīm* — their mother, Kuntī; *ca* — and; *kulya* — family obligations; *karaṇe* — to carry out; *saha*-*rāmaḥ* — together with Lord Balarāma; *yayau* — went; *kurūn* — to the kingdom of the Kurus.

### Purport

The Lord was quite aware that the Pāṇḍavas had escaped the assassination plot of Duryodhana, although the world heard the false news that the Pāṇḍavas and their mother had perished in the fire.

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that those who were involved in the assassination attempt were of course not at all sorry to hear of the Pāṇḍavas’ death. The persons specifically mentioned here, however — Bhīṣma, Kṛpa, Vidura, Gāndhārī and Droṇa — were actually unhappy to hear of the supposed tragedy.

*labdhvaitad antaraṁ rājan

### Purport

Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā reasoned that since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma were absent from Dvārakā, Satrājit could be killed and the jewel stolen. Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions that these two must have flattered Śatadhanvā telling him, “You are much braver than we are; so you kill him.”

योऽस्मभ्यं सम्प्रतिश्रुत्य कन्यारत्नं विगर्ह्य न- ।  
कृष्णायादान्न सत्राजित् कस्माद् भ्रातरमन्वियात् ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*yo ’smabhyaṁ sampratiśrutya  
kanyā-ratnaṁ vigarhya naḥ  
kṛṣṇāyādān na satrājit  
kasmād bhrātaram anviyāt*

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* — who; *asmabhyam* — to each of us; *sampratiśrutya* — promising; *kanyā* — his daughter; *ratnam* — jewellike; *vigarhya* — contemptuously neglecting; *naḥ* — us; *kṛṣṇāya* — to Kṛṣṇa; *adāt* — gave; *na* — not; *satrājit* — Satrājit; *kasmāt* — why; *bhrātaram* — his brother; *anviyāt* — should follow (in death).

### Translation

**“Satrājit promised his jewellike daughter to us but then gave her to Kṛṣṇa instead, contemptuously neglecting us. So why should Satrājit not follow his brother’s path?”**

### Purport

Since Satrājit’s brother, Prasena, had been violently killed, the implication of “following his brother’s path” is obvious. What we have here is an assassination plot.

It is well known that both Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā are exalted, pure devotees of the Supreme Lord, so their unusual behavior requires some explanation. The *ācāryas* provide it as follows: Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states that Akrūra, although a first-class, pure devotee of the Lord, was a victim of the anger directed against him by the residents of Gokula because he took Lord Kṛṣṇa away from Vṛndāvana. The *gosvāmī* further states that Kṛtavarmā had associated with Kaṁsa — both of them being members of the Bhoja dynasty — and thus Kṛtavarmā was now suffering from this undesirable association.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī offers an alternative explanation: Both Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā were furious with Satrājit because he had insulted Lord Kṛṣṇa and spread false rumors about Him in Dvārakā. Under normal circumstances Akrūra and Kṛtavarmā would have been most pleased that Lord Kṛṣṇa married the beautiful Satyabhāmā. Being pure devotees, they could not actually be unhappy about this match, nor could they become jealous rivals of the Lord. Therefore they had an ulterior motive in behaving like His rivals.

### Translation

**His mind thus influenced by their advice, wicked Śatadhanvā murdered Satrājit in his sleep simply out of greed. In this way the sinful Śatadhanvā shortened his own life span.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the word *asattamaḥ* indicates that Śatadhanvā was basically evil-minded and a firm hater of Satrājit.

### Verse text

*ya idaṁ līlayā viśvaṁ  
sṛjaty avati hanti ca  
ceṣṭāṁ viśva-sṛjo yasya

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* — who; *idam* — this; *līlayā* — as play; *viśvam* — universe; *sṛjati* — creates; *avati* — maintains; *hanti* — destroys; *ca* — and; *ceṣṭām* — purpose; *viśva*-*sṛjaḥ* — the (secondary) creators of the universe (headed by Lord Brahmā); *yasya* — whose; *na* *viduḥ* — do not know; *mohitāḥ* — bewildered; *ajayā* — by His eternal deluding potency.

### Translation

**“It is the Supreme Lord who creates, maintains and destroys this universe simply as His pastime. The cosmic creators cannot even understand His purpose, bewildered as they are by His illusory Māyā.**

### Purport

The use of the singular *yaḥ,* “He who,” indicates that the frequent references to “the two Lords, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma,” do not compromise the firm principle of monotheism expressed in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* As explained in many Vedic literatures, the one Supreme Lord expands Himself into innumerable forms, yet He remains the one and almighty God. For example, we have this statement in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33): *advaitam acyutam anādir ananta-rūpam.* “The one Supreme Lord is infallible and beginningless, and He expands Himself into innumerable manifest forms.” Out of regard for the spirit of the Lord’s pastimes, in which He expands Himself and appears as His own older brother, Balarāma, the *Bhāgavatam* here refers to “the two Lords.” But the “bottom line” is that there is one Supreme Godhead, one Absolute Truth, who appears in His original form as Kṛṣṇa.

### Translation

**His appeal thus rejected by Akrūra also, Śatadhanvā placed the precious jewel in Akrūra’s care and fled on a horse that could travel one hundred yojanas \[eight hundred miles\].**

### Purport

The term *nyasya,* “leaving in the care of,” implies Śatadhanvā now believed the jewel was his; thus he was leaving it in the care of a friend. In blunt terms, this is a thief’s mentality.

### Verse text

*akrūre proṣite ’riṣṭāny  
āsan vai dvārakaukasām  
śārīrā mānasās tāpā  
muhur daivika-bhautikāḥ*

### Synonyms

*akrūre* — Akrūra; *proṣite* — being in exile; *ariṣṭāni* — ill omens; *āsan* — arose; *vai* — indeed; *dvārakā*-*okasām* — for the residents of Dvārakā; *śārīrāḥ* — caused by the body; *mānasaḥ* — and by the mind; *tāpāḥ* — distresses; *muhuḥ* — repeated; *daivika* — caused by higher powers; *bhautikāḥ* — caused by other creatures.

### Translation

**In Akrūra’s absence ill omens arose in Dvārakā, and the citizens began to suffer continually from physical and mental distresses, as well as from disturbances caused by higher powers and by creatures of the earth.**

### Purport

The word *daivika* here refers to disturbances caused by supernatural beings. These disturbances often manifest as natural calamities like earthquakes, tidal waves or extreme weather. Nowadays materialistic people attribute these disturbances to earthly causes, not realizing that they constitute punishment at the hands of superior beings. The word *bhautikāḥ* refers to trouble caused by fellow creatures of the earth, such as human beings, animals and insects.

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, Akrūra took the Syamantaka jewel and went to reside in the city of Benares, where he became known as Dānapati, “the master of charity.” There he executed fire sacrifices on gold altars with elaborate assemblies of qualified priests.

Some residents of Dvārakā felt that the unusual calamities were due to Akrūra’s absence, forgetting (as described in the next verse) that the Supreme Lord’s personal presence in Dvārakā precluded that possibility. Because when the Lord comes to earth His pastimes resemble those of human beings, the principle of “familiarity breeds contempt” comes into play. It appears that during the lives of many saintly persons and incarnations of God there always exists a class of people who fail to appreciate, or who only occasionally appreciate, the position of the great souls among them. On the other hand, the fortunate and enlightened souls who recognize the true position of the Lord and His associates are supremely blessed.

### Translation

**Some men proposed \[that the troubles were due to Akrūra’s absence\], but they had forgotten the glories of the Supreme Lord, which they themselves had so often described. Indeed, how can calamities occur in a place where the Personality of Godhead, the residence of all the sages, resides?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī provides the following insight on this verse: In Benares Akrūra became famous for performing sacrifices on golden altars and for his abundant charity to the *brāhmaṇas.* When the citizens of Dvārakā heard about this, some of them gossiped that Kṛṣṇa, considering Akrūra a rival, had sent him into exile. To dispel this new and incredible stain on His reputation, Lord Kṛṣṇa created various calamities in Dvārakā, thus inducing the citizens to call for Akrūra’s return, which the Lord then ordered.

*deve* — when the demigod, Lord Indra; *avarṣati* — had not been supplying rain; *kāśī*-*īśaḥ* — the King of Benares; *śvaphalkāya* — to Śvaphalka (Akrūra’s father); *āgatāya* — who had come; *vai* — certainly; *sva* — his own; *sutām* — daughter; *gāndinīm* — Gāndinī; *prādāt* — gave; *tataḥ* — then; *avarṣat* — it rained; *sma* — indeed; *kāśiṣu* — in the kingdom of Kāśī.

### Translation

**\[The elders said:\] Previously, when Lord Indra had withheld rain from Kāsī \[Benares\], the king of that city gave his daughter Gāndinī to Śvaphalka, who was then visiting him. It soon rained in the kingdom of Kāśī.**

### Purport

Śvaphalka was Akrūra’s father, and the citizens felt that the son must have the same power as the father. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that because of Akrūra’s relationship with his maternal grandfather, the King of Kāśī, in a time of difficulty Akrūra went to that city.

### Translation

**Hearing these words from the elders, Lord Janārdana, though aware that the absence of Akrūra was not the only cause of the evil omens, had him summoned back to Dvārakā and spoke to him.**

### Purport

Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller, it was obviously by His will that certain troubles appeared in the city of Dvārakā. Superficially these evils may have been caused by Akrūra’s absence, and also by the absence of the auspicious Syamantaka jewel. But we should recall that Dvārakā is the eternal abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa; it is a city of divine bliss because the Lord resides there. Still, to execute His pastimes as a prince of this world, Lord Kṛṣṇa did the needful and summoned Akrūra.

**Lord Kṛṣṇa honored Akrūra, greeted him confidentially and spoke pleasant words with him. Then the Lord, who was fully aware of Akrūra’s heart by virtue of His being the knower of everything, smiled and addressed him: “O master of charity, surely the opulent Syamantaka jewel was left in your care by Śatadhanvā and is still with you. Indeed, We have known this all along.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa’s treatment of Akrūra here confirms that he is actually a great devotee of the Lord.

### Translation

**“Since Satrājit had no sons, his daughter’s sons should receive his inheritance. They should pay for memorial offerings of water and piṇḍa, clear their grandfather’s outstanding debts and keep the remainder of the inheritance for themselves.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī quotes the following *smṛti* injunction regarding inheritance: *patnī duhitaraś caiva pitaro bhrātaras tathā*/*tat-sutā gotra-jā bandhuḥ śiṣyāḥ sa-brahmacāriṇaḥ.* “The inheritance goes first to the wife, then \[if the wife has passed away\] to the daughters, then to the parents, then to the brothers, then to the brothers’ sons, then to family members of the same *gotra* as the deceased, and then to his disciples, including *brahmacārīs.”*

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds that since Satrājit had no sons, since his wives were killed together with him, and since his daughter Satyabhāmā was not interested in the Syamantaka jewel, which constituted the inheritance, it rightfully belonged to her sons.

In *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,* Śrīla Prabhupāda explains: “Lord Kṛṣṇa indicated by this statement that Satyabhāmā was already pregnant and that her son would be the real claimant of the jewel and would certainly take the jewel from Akrūra.”

### Purport

Although technically Satyabhāmā’s sons had a right to the jewel, Lord Kṛṣṇa decided to leave the jewel in the care of Akrūra, who was using the jewel’s wealth to continually perform religious sacrifices. Indeed, Akrūra’s ability to perform such rituals on altars of gold was an indication of the jewel’s potency.

For the second time, doubts about the Lord’s reputation occasioned by the Syamantaka jewel are dispelled by the jewel itself. Indeed, for the second time the Lord brought the jewel to Dvārakā to establish His integrity there. This amazing series of incidents demonstrates that even when Lord Kṛṣṇa descends to this world there is a tendency for His “peers” to criticize Him. The whole material world is infected by the faultfinding propensity, and in this chapter the Supreme Lord demonstrates the nature of this undesirable quality.
