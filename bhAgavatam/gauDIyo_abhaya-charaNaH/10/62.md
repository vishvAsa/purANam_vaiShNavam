CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO

This chapter recounts the meeting of Aniruddha and Ūṣā, and also Aniruddha’s battle with Bāṇāsura.

Of the one hundred sons of King Bali, the oldest was Bāṇāsura. He was a great devotee of Lord Śiva, who favored Bāṇa so much that even demigods like Indra would serve him. Bāṇāsura once satisfied Śiva by playing musical instruments with his one thousand hands while Śiva danced his *tāṇḍava-nṛtya.* In response, Śiva offered Bāṇa whatever benediction he chose, and Bāṇa asked Śiva to become the guardian of his city.

One day when Bāṇa was feeling an urge to do battle, he told Lord Śiva: “Except for you, in the whole world there is no warrior strong enough to fight me. Therefore these thousand arms you’ve given me are merely a heavy burden.” Angered by these words, Lord Śiva replied, “Your pride will be crushed in battle when you meet my equal. Indeed, your chariot flag will fall to the ground, broken.”

Bāṇāsura’s daughter, Ūṣā, once had an encounter with a lover in her sleep. Several nights in a row this occurred, until one night she failed to see Him in her dreams. She suddenly awoke, speaking aloud to Him in a state of agitation, but when she noticed her maidservants around her, she felt embarrassed. Ūṣā’s companion Citralekhā asked her who she had been addressing, and Ūṣā told her everything. Hearing of Ūṣā’s dreamlover, Citralekhā tried to relieve her friend’s distress by drawing pictures of Gandharvas and other celestial personalities, as well as various men of the Vṛṣṇi dynasty. Citralekhā asked Ūṣā to pick out the man she had seen in her dreams, and Ūṣā pointed to the picture of Aniruddha. Citralekhā, who had mystic powers, knew at once that the young man her friend had pointed out was Lord Kṛṣṇa’s grandson Aniruddha. Then, using her mystic powers, Citralekhā flew through the sky to Dvārakā, found Aniruddha and brought Him back with her to Śoṇitapura, Bāṇāsura’s capital. There she presented Him to Ūṣā.

Having obtained the man of her desires, Ūṣā began serving Him very affectionately within her private quarters, which were supposed to be strictly off limits to men. After some time the female guards of the inner palace noticed symptoms of sexual activity on Ūṣā’s person, and they went to Bāṇāsura to inform him. Greatly disturbed, Bāṇāsura rushed to his daughter’s apartments with many armed guards and, to his great surprise, saw Aniruddha there. As the guards attacked Him, Aniruddha took up His club and succeeded in killing a few before the powerful Bāṇa could capture Him with his mystic *nāga-pāśa* ropes, filling Ūṣā with lamentation.

Bāṇāsura, born from Bali’s semen, became a great devotee of Lord Śiva. His behavior was always respectable, and he was generous, intelligent, truthful and firm in his vows. The beautiful city of Śoṇitapura was under his dominion. Because Lord Śiva had favored him, the very demigods waited on Bāṇāsura like menial servants. Once, when Śiva was dancing his tāṇḍava-nṛtya, Bāṇa especially satisfied the lord by playing a musical accompaniment with his one thousand arms.**

इत्युक्त- कुमतिर्हृष्ट- स्वगृहं प्राविशन्नृप ।  
प्रतीक्षन् गिरिशादेशं स्ववीर्यनशनं कुधी- ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*ity uktaḥ kumatir hṛṣṭaḥ  
sva-gṛhaṁ prāviśan nṛpa  
pratīkṣan giriśādeśaṁ  
sva-vīrya-naśanam kudhīḥ*

### Synonyms

*iti* — thus; *uktaḥ* — spoken to; *ku*-*matiḥ* — foolish; *hṛṣṭaḥ* — delighted; *sva* — his own; *gṛham* — home; *prāviśat* — entered; *nṛpa* — O King (Parīkṣit); *pratīkṣan* — waiting for; *giriśa* — of Lord Śiva; *ādeśam* — prediction; *sva*-*vīrya* — of his prowess; *naśanam* — the destruction; *ku*-*dhīḥ* — unintelligent.

### Translation

**Thus advised, unintelligent Bāṇāsura was delighted. The fool then went home, O King, to wait for that which Lord Giriśa had predicted: the destruction of his prowess.**

### Purport

Here Bāṇāsura is described as *ku-dhī* (“having bad intelligence”) and *ku-mati* (“foolish”) because he completely misunderstood the actual situation. This demon was so arrogant that he was convinced no one could defeat him. He was delighted to hear that someone as powerful as Lord Śiva would come to fight with him and satisfy his itching for battle. Even though Śiva had said that this person would break Bāṇa’s flag and destroy his prowess, the demon was too foolish to take this statement seriously and eagerly awaited the fight.

At the present moment materialistic people are delighted by the many unprecedented facilities for sense gratification. Although it is clear that death, both individual and collective, is quickly approaching them, modern sense gratifiers are oblivious to their inevitable destruction. As stated in the *Bhāgavatam* (2.1.4), *paśyann api na paśyati:* Even though their imminent destruction is apparent, they are too blind to see it, being intoxicated by sex enjoyment and family attachment. Similarly, Bāṇāsura was intoxicated with his material prowess and could not believe that he was about to be cut down to size.

### Translation

**In a dream Bāṇa’s daughter, the maiden Ūṣā, had an amorous encounter with the son of Pradyumna, though she had never before seen or heard of her lover.**

### Purport

The incidents now described will lead up to the fight predicted by Lord Śiva. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura quotes the following verses from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa,* which explain Ūṣā’s dream:

*ūṣā bāṇa-sutā vipra  
pārvatīm śambhunā saha  
krīḍantīm upalakṣyoccaiḥ  
spṛhāṁ cakre tad-āśrayām*

“O *brāhmaṇa,* when Ūṣā, the daughter of Bāṇa, happened to see Pārvatī playing with her husband, Lord Śambhu, Ūṣā intensely desired to experience the same feelings.”

*tataḥ sakala-citta-jña  
gaurī tām aha bhāvinīm  
alam atyartha-tāpena  
bhartrā tvam api raṁsyase*

“At that time Goddess Gaurī \[Pārvatī\], who knows everyone’s heart, told the sensitive young girl, ‘Don’t be so disturbed! You will have a chance to enjoy with your own husband.’”

*ity uktā sā tadā cakre  
kadeti matim ātmanaḥ  
ko vā bhartā mamety enāṁ  
punar apy āha pārvatī*

“Hearing this, Ūṣā thought to herself, ‘But when? And who will my husband be?’ In response, Pārvatī addressed her once more.”

*vaiśākha-śukla-dvādaśyāṁ  
svapne yo ’bhibhavaṁ tava  
kariṣyati sa te bhartā  
rāja-putri bhaviṣyati*

“‘The man who approaches you in your dream on the twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaiśākha will become your husband, O princess.’”

### Translation

**O King, among the humans, Citralekhā drew pictures of the Vṛṣṇis, including Śūrasena, Ānakadundubhi, Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa. When Ūṣā saw the picture of Pradyumna she became bashful, and when she saw Aniruddha’s picture she bent her head down in embarrassment. Smiling, she exclaimed, “He’s the one! It’s Him!”**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives this further insight: When Ūṣā saw the picture of Pradyumna, she became bashful because she thought, “This is my father-in-law.” Then she saw the picture of her lover, Aniruddha, and cried out in joy.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows on this verse: “It is stated here that Citralekhā resorted to mystic power (*yogam āsthitā*). As explained in the *Hari-vaṁśa* and other literatures, she needed to employ her powers because when she arrived at Dvārakā she found herself unable to enter Lord Kṛṣṇa’s city. At that time Śrī Nārada Muni instructed her in the mystic art of entering. Some authorities also say that Citralekhā is herself an expansion of Yoga-māyā.”

### Translation

**The female guards eventually noticed unmistakable symptoms of romantic involvement in Ūṣā, who, having broken her maiden vow, was being enjoyed by the Yadu hero and showing signs of conjugal happiness. The guards went to Bāṇāsura and told him, “O King, we have detected in your daughter the kind of improper behavior that spoils the reputation of a young girl’s family.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has defined the word *bhaṭāḥ* as “female guards,” whereas Jīva Gosvāmī defines it as “eunuchs and others.” Grammatically, the word can function both ways.

The guards feared that if Bāṇāsura found out about Ūṣā’s activities from some other source, he would severely punish them, and thus they personally informed him that his young daughter was no longer innocent.

### Translation

**“We have been carefully watching over her, never leaving our posts, O master, so we cannot understand how this maiden, whom no man can even see, has been corrupted within the palace.”**

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain that the word *anapāyibhiḥ* can mean either “never going away” or “never deluded.” Also, if we take the alternate reading *duṣpreṣyāyāḥ* instead of *duṣprekṣyāyāḥ,* the guards refer to Ūṣā as “she whose wicked girlfriend has been sent on a mission.”

As He sat opposite His most auspicious lover, playing with her at dice, there hung between His arms a garland of spring jasmines that had been smeared with kuṅkuma powder from her breasts when He had embraced her. Bāṇāsura was astonished to see all this.**

### Purport

Bāṇāsura was amazed at Aniruddha’s boldness: the prince was calmly sitting in the young girl’s quarters, playing with Bāṇa’s supposedly unmarried daughter! In the context of the strict Vedic culture, this was an unbelievable thing to witness.

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain that Bāṇāsura could not actually capture the powerful grandson of Lord Kṛṣṇa. However, the Lord’s *līla-śakti,* or pastime potency, allowed this to happen so that the events described in the next chapter could take place.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Tenth Canto, Sixty-second Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Meeting of Ūṣā and Aniruddha.”*
