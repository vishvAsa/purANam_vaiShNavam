CHAPTER THIRTY

This chapter describes how the *gopīs,* tormented through the long night by separation from Kṛṣṇa, wandered like madwomen from forest to forest in search of Him.

When Śrī Kṛṣṇa suddenly disappeared from the arena of the *rāsa* dance, the *gopīs,* their minds fully absorbed in thoughts of Him, began looking for Him in the various forests. From all the moving and nonmoving creatures they asked for news of Kṛṣṇa’s whereabouts. Finally they became so distraught that they began imitating His pastimes.

Later, while wandering in a corner of the forest, the *gopīs* saw Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s footprints, which appeared mixed with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s. Seeing these footprints perturbed them greatly, and they declared that surely Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī must have worshiped Kṛṣṇa with unusual excellence, since She had been privileged to associate with Him in seclusion. Further along the path the *gopīs* came to a place where they could no longer see Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s footprints; they then concluded that Kṛṣṇa must have taken Rādhārāṇī onto His shoulders. In another place they noticed that Kṛṣṇa’s footprints were showing only the toes, and thus the *gopīs* concluded He had been picking flowers with which to decorate His beloved. In yet another spot the *gopīs* saw signs that led them to imagine that Śrī Kṛṣṇa had been tying the locks of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s hair. All these thoughts brought pain to the *gopīs’* minds.

Because of the special attention She received from Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Rādhā began to consider Herself the most fortunate of women. She told Him that She could walk no further and that He would have to carry Her on His shoulders. But just then Lord Kṛṣṇa disappeared from Her sight. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, extremely troubled, then began looking everywhere for Him, and when She finally met Her *gopī* girlfriends She related to them what had happened. All the *gopīs* then went out to look for Kṛṣṇa in the forest, going as far as the moonlight reached. But in the end they were unsuccessful, so they went back to the shore of the Yamunā and simply sang Kṛṣṇa’s glories in utter helplessness.

### Translation

**As the cowherd women remembered Lord Kṛṣṇa, their hearts were overwhelmed by His movements and loving smiles, His playful glances and enchanting talks, and by the many other pastimes He would enjoy with them. Thus absorbed in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of Ramā, the gopīs began acting out His various transcendental pastimes.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura describes the following charming exchange between Kṛṣṇa and the *gopīs:*

“Kṛṣṇa said to a *gopī,* ‘My dear land lily, are you going to offer your honey to this very thirsty honeybee or not?’

“The *gopī* replied, ‘My dear bee, the husband of the lilies is the sun, not the bee, so why are You claiming that my honey belongs to You?’

“But My dear lily, the very nature of you lilies is that you don’t give your honey to your husband, the sun, but rather to your paramour, the bee.’ The *gopī,* defeated by the words of Kṛṣṇa, laughed and then gave Him her lips as honey to drink.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī also describes the following conversation:

“Kṛṣṇa said to a *gopī,* ‘Ah, I can understand that as you approached this *nīpa* tree standing here, you were bitten by an audacious snake. Its venom has already reached your chest, but since you are a respectable maiden you haven’t asked Me to cure you. Still I’ve come, being merciful by nature. Now, while I massage your body with My hands, I’ll chant a *mantra* to counteract the serpent’s poison.’

“The *gopī* said, ‘But, my dear snake charmer, no snake has bitten me. Go massage the body of some girl who actually has suffered a snakebite.’

“‘Come now, My dear respectable girl, from your trembling voice I can tell that you are experiencing a feverish reaction to poisoning. Knowing this, if I don’t take care of you I’ll be guilty of killing an innocent woman. So let Me treat you.’

“With this, Kṛṣṇa applied His fingernails to the *gopī’s* chest.”

### Translation

**Because the beloved gopīs were absorbed in thoughts of their beloved Kṛṣṇa, their bodies imitated His way of moving and smiling, His way of beholding them, His speech and His other distinctive features. Deeply immersed in thinking of Him and maddened by remembering His pastimes, they declared to one another, “I am Kṛṣṇa!”**

### Purport

Spontaneously, the *gopīs* began moving like Kṛṣṇa: they smiled as He would smile, glanced boldly as He would and spoke as He would. The *gopīs* were completely absorbed in the existence of Kṛṣṇa and mad with love at their sudden separation from Him, and thus their dedication to Him attained absolute perfection.

### Translation

**Singing loudly of Kṛṣṇa, they searched for Him throughout the Vṛndāvana forest like a band of madwomen. They even asked the trees about Him, who as the Supersoul is present inside and outside of all created things, just like the sky.**

### Purport

Lost in the madness of love for Kṛṣṇa, the *gopīs* inquired about Him from even the trees in Vṛndāvana. Of course, there is no actual separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa, since He is the all-pervading Supersoul.

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain here that the word *caraṇa* is a term of respect, as in the expression *evaṁ vadanty ācārya-caraṇāḥ.* The bees humming around the garland worn by Śrī Govinda were attracted by the fragrance of the *tulasī* *mañjarīs* offered to Him. The *gopīs* felt that the trees had not replied because they were male, but that *tulasī,* being female, would sympathize with their plight.

### Purport

When even *tulasī* herself did not answer the *gopīs,* they approached the fragrant jasmine flowers. The *gopīs,* seeing the jasmine vines humbly bowing down, assumed that these plants must have seen Lord Kṛṣṇa and were therefore showing humility in their ecstasy.

### Translation

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the *cūta* is a mango creeper, whereas the *āmra* is a mango tree. He goes on to explain that the *nīpa,* though not a very prominent tree, bears large flowers, and that the *gopīs’* desperation to find Kṛṣṇa is clearly shown by the fact that they approached the insignificant *arka* plant.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī gives the following information about Vṛndāvana’s trees: “The *nīpa* is ‘the dust *kadamba,*’ and it has large flowers. The *kadamba* proper has smaller flowers and a very pleasant fragrance. The *kovidāra* is a particular kind of *kañcanāra* \[mountain ebony tree\]. Even though the *arka* plant is very insignificant, it always grows near Lord Gopīśvara \[the Śiva deity in Vṛndāvana forest\] because it is dear to him.”

### Synonyms

### Translation

**O mother earth, what austerity did you perform to attain the touch of Lord Keśava’s lotus feet, which has brought you such great joy that your bodily hairs are standing on end? You appear very beautiful in this condition. Was it during the Lord’s current appearance that you acquired this ecstatic symptom, or was it perhaps much earlier, when He stepped upon you in His form of the dwarf Vāmanadeva, or even earlier, when He embraced you in His form of the boar Varāhadeva?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains the thoughts of the *gopīs* as follows: “‘Perhaps the trees and plants \[mentioned in the previous verses\] did not hear our question because they were in trance, meditating on Lord Viṣṇu. Or perhaps, since they will not tell us where Kṛṣṇa has gone, they are hardhearted even though they live in a holy place. Anyway, what is the use of unnecessarily criticizing the residents of a holy place? We cannot tell if they really know where Kṛṣṇa has gone. So let us find someone who definitely knows where He is.’ Thus the *gopīs* concluded that since Lord Kṛṣṇa had to be *somewhere* on the earth, the earth herself must know His whereabouts.

“Then the *gopīs* thought, ‘Since Kṛṣṇa always walks on the earth, she is never separated from Him and thus cannot understand how much His parents, girlfriends and servants suffer in His absence. Let us ask her what austerities she has performed to gain the great fortune of being constantly touched by the feet of Lord Keśava.’”

### Translation

**O friend, wife of the deer, has Lord Acyuta been here with His beloved, bringing great joy to your eyes? Indeed, blowing this way is the fragrance of His garland of kunda flowers, which was smeared with the kuṅkuma from the breasts of His girlfriend when He embraced Her.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī provides the following charming commentary on this verse:

“The *gopīs* spoke to a doe, ‘O friend, wife of the deer, from the bliss in your clear eyes we can tell that Śrī Kṛṣṇa has expanded your joy with the beauty of His limbs, His face and so forth. You are eager to realize the ecstasy of seeing Kṛṣṇa, and thus your eyes are following Him. In fact, He is never lost to you.’

“Then the *gopīs,* seeing the doe continue to walk in her natural way, exclaimed, ‘Oh, are you telling us that you have seen Kṛṣṇa? Look! As this deer walks she constantly turns her head back to us, as if to say, “I will show Him to you; just follow me and I will show you Kṛṣṇa.” In this merciless Vṛndāvana, she is the only merciful person.’

“As the *gopīs* follow the doe they happen to lose sight of her, and they cry out, ‘Oh, why can’t we see the deer who is showing us the way to Kṛṣṇa?’

“One *gopī* suggests that Kṛṣṇa must be somewhere in the vicinity and that the deer, being afraid of Him, must have hidden herself to avoid the possible mistake of revealing His presence. Conjecturing in this way, the *gopīs* detect a fragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declare with great joy, ‘Yes! Yes! This is it! By Kṛṣṇa’s physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the *kuṅkuma* powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.’ Thus the *gopīs* smelled the aroma of the two lovers’ bodies, of Kṛṣṇa’s jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover.”

### Synonyms

*bāhum* — His arm; *priyā* — of His beloved; *aṁse* — on the shoulder; *upadhāya* — placing; *gṛhīta* — holding; *padmaḥ* — a lotus; *rāma*-*anujaḥ* — Kṛṣṇa, the younger brother of Balarāma; *tulasikā* — swarming around the *tulasī* *mañjarīs* (which are ornamenting His garland); *ali*-*kulaiḥ* — by the many bees; *mada* — with intoxication; *andhaiḥ* — who are blind; *anvīyamānaḥ* — being followed; *iha* — here; *vaḥ* — your; *taravaḥ* — O trees; *praṇāmam* — the bowing down; *kim* *vā* — whether; *abhinandati* — has acknowledged; *caran* — while walking by; *praṇaya* — imbued with love; *avalokaiḥ* — with His glances.

### Translation

**O trees, we see that you are bowing down. When the younger brother of Rāma walked by here, followed by intoxicated bees swarming around the tulasī mañjarīs decorating His garland, did He acknowledge your obeisances with His affectionate glances? He must have been resting His arm on the shoulder of His beloved and carrying a lotus flower in His free hand.**

### Purport

The *gopīs* saw that the trees, bent over with abundant fruits and flowers, were offering obeisances to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The *gopīs* supposed Kṛṣṇa must have recently passed that way, since the trees were still bowing down. Because Śrī Kṛṣṇa had left the *gopīs* to go with His favorite consort, they were jealous and thus imagined that He had become fatigued from His loving affairs and was resting His left arm on the soft shoulder of His beloved. The *gopīs* further imagined that Kṛṣṇa must have been carrying a blue lotus in His right hand to drive away the bees eagerly trying to attack His beloved’s face after smelling its aroma. The scene was so beautiful, the *gopīs* imagined, that the maddened bees had left the *tulasī* garden to follow the two lovers.

### Translation

**Let us ask these creepers about Kṛṣṇa. Even though they are embracing the arms of their husband, this tree, they certainly must have been touched by Kṛṣṇa’s fingernails, since out of joy they are manifesting eruptions on their skin.**

### Purport

The *gopīs* reasoned that the creepers would not show signs of rapture merely by physical contact with their husband, a tree. Thus the *gopīs* concluded that although the creepers were embracing the strong limbs of their husband, they must have been touched by Lord Kṛṣṇa as He moved through the forest.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, in his commentary on this verse, gives the following scriptural information about the symbolic markings on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa:

“In the following verses the *Skanda Purāṇa* states the particular places on His feet where Kṛṣṇa carries the mark of the flag and also other marks, and the reasons for these marks:

*dakṣiṇasya padāṅguṣṭha-  
mūle cakraṁ bibharty ajaḥ  
tatra bhakta-janasyāri-  
ṣaḍ-varga-cchedanāya saḥ*

‘At the base of the large toe on His right foot, the unborn Lord carries the mark of a disc, which cuts down the six \[mental\] enemies of His devotees.’

*madhyamāṅguli-mūle ca  
dhatte kamalam acyutaḥ  
dhyātṛ-citta-dvirephāṇāṁ  
lobhanāyāti-śobhanām*

‘At the bottom of the middle toe of that same foot Lord Acyuta has a lotus flower, which increases the greed for Him in the minds of the beelike devotees who meditate on His feet.’

*kaniṣṭha-mūlato vajraṁ  
bhakta-pāpādri-bhedanam  
pārṣṇi-madhye ’ṅkuśaṁ bhakta  
cittebha-vaśa-kāriṇam*

‘At the base of His small toe is a thunderbolt, which smashes the mountains of His devotees’ reactions to past sins, and in the middle of His heel is the mark of an elephant goad, which brings the elephants of His devotees’ minds under control.’

*bhoga-sampan-mayaṁ dhatte  
yavam aṅguṣṭha-parvaṇi*

‘The joint of His right large toe bears the mark of a barleycorn, representing all kinds of enjoyable opulences.’

“The *Skanda Purāṇa* also states:

*vajraṁ vai dakṣiṇe pārśve  
aṅkuśo vai tad-agrataḥ*

‘A thunderbolt is found on the right side of His right foot, and an elephant goad below that.’

“The *ācāryas* of the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya* explain that since the particular feet under discussion are Lord Kṛṣṇa’s, we should know that the thunderbolt is at the base of His small toe and the elephant goad below the thunderbolt. An elephant goad on the heel belongs rather to Lord Nārāyaṇa and other *viṣṇu-tattva* expansions.

“Thus the *Skanda Purāṇa* describes six marks on Kṛṣṇa’s right foot — the disc, flag, lotus, thunderbolt, elephant goad and barleycorn. And the *Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī* mentions even more marks — a vertical line beginning at the middle of His foot and continuing as far as the juncture between His big toe and second toe; an umbrella below the disc; at the base of the middle of His foot, a group of four *svastikas* in the four cardinal directions; at the four points where each *svastika* meets the next, four rose apples; and in the middle of the *svastikas,* an octagon. This makes eleven marks on Kṛṣṇa’s right foot.”

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī describes the marks on Kṛṣṇa’s left foot as follows: “At the base of the large toe is a conchshell with its mouth facing the toe. At the base of the middle toe are two concentric circles, representing the inner and outer sky. Below this mark is Cupid’s unstrung bow, at the base of the bow is a triangle, and surrounding the triangle is a group of four waterpots. At the base of the triangle is a half-moon with two more triangles touching its points, and below the half-moon is a fish.

“All together, then, there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.”

### Translation

**Certainly this particular gopī has perfectly worshiped the all-powerful Personality of Godhead, Govinda, since He was so pleased with Her that He abandoned the rest of us and brought Her to a secluded place.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the word *ārādhitaḥ* refers to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. He comments, “The sage Śukadeva Gosvāmī has tried with all endeavor to keep Her name hidden, but now it automatically shines forth from the moon of his mouth. That he has spoken Her name is indeed Her mercy, and thus the word *ārādhitaḥ* is like the rumbling of a kettledrum sounded to announce Her great good fortune.”

Although the *gopīs* spoke as if jealous of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, they were actually ecstatic to see that She had captured Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes the following detailed description of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s footprints, as given by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his *Śrī Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi:* “At the base of the large toe of Her left foot is the mark of a barleycorn, below that mark is a disc, below the disc is an umbrella, and below the umbrella is a bracelet. A vertical line extends from the middle of Her foot to the juncture of Her large and second toes. At the base of the middle toe is a lotus, below that is a flag with a banner, and below the flag is a creeper, together with a flower. At the base of Her small toe is an elephant goad, and upon Her heel is a half-moon. Thus there are eleven marks on Her left foot.

“At the base of the large toe of Her right foot is a conchshell, and below that a spear. At the base of the small toe of Her right foot is a sacrificial altar, below that an earring, and below the earring a club. Along the base of the second, third, fourth and small toes is the mark of a mountain, below which is a chariot, and on the heel is a fish.

“Thus all together there are nineteen distinguishing marks on the soles of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s lotus feet.”

*dhanyāḥ* — sanctified; *aho* — ah; *amī* — these; *ālyaḥ* — O *gopīs*; *govinda* — of Govinda; *aṅghri*-*abja* — of the lotuslike feet; *reṇavaḥ* — the particles of dust; *yān* — which; *brahmā* — Lord Brahmā; *īśau* — and Lord Śiva; *ramā* *devī* — Ramādevī, the wife of Lord Viṣṇu; *dadhuḥ* — take; *mūrdhni* — on their heads; *agha* — of their sinful reactions; *nuttaye* — for the dispelling.

### Translation

**O girls! The dust of Govinda’s lotus feet is so sacred that even Brahmā, Śiva and the goddess Ramā take that dust upon their heads to dispel sinful reactions.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, who quotes from *śāstra,* each day in the late afternoon, as Kṛṣṇa returned from the cow pastures with His cowherd boyfriends, great demigods like Brahmā and Śiva would come down from heaven and take the dust of His feet.

Great personalities like the goddess Ramā (the wife of Viṣṇu), Śiva and Brahmā are not at all sinful. But in the ecstasy of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness they feel themselves fallen and impure. Thus, desiring to purify themselves, they blissfully take the dust of the Lord’s lotus feet on their heads.

**Please observe, my dear gopīs, how in this place lusty Kṛṣṇa’s footprints are pressed more deeply into the ground. Carrying the weight of His beloved must have been difficult for Him. And over here that intelligent boy must have put Her down to gather some flowers.**

### Purport

The word *vadhūm* indicates that even though Śrī Kṛṣṇa was not officially married to Rādhārāṇī, He had in fact made Her His bride in the Vṛndāvana forest.

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the *gopīs* use the word *kāminaḥ* here to indicate the following thoughts: “We actually love Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but still He has rejected us. Therefore His private dealings with Rādhārāṇī prove that this young prince of Vraja has carried Her away because of lust. If He were interested in love, He would have accepted us instead of that cowherd girl Rādhārāṇī.”

These thoughts reveal the mood of the *gopīs* who are rivals of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Of course, the *gopīs* who are Her direct allies were jubilant to see Her good fortune.

### Purport

The *ācāryas* explain that Śrī Kṛṣṇa wanted to decorate Rādhārāṇī’s hair with the forest flowers He had collected. Therefore They sat down together facing the same direction, with Rādhārāṇī between Kṛṣṇa’s knees, and Kṛṣṇa proceeded to arrange Her hair with flowers and make a flower crown for Her, coronating Her as the goddess of the forest. Thus the romantic young boy and girl played and joked together in Vṛndāvana.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] Lord Kṛṣṇa enjoyed with that gopī, although He enjoys only within, being self-satisfied and complete in Himself. Thus by contrast He showed the wretchedness of ordinary lusty men and hardhearted women.**

### Purport

This verse directly refutes the superficial criticism materialistic people sometimes direct against Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. The philosopher Aristotle claimed that ordinary activities are unworthy of God, and with this idea in mind some people declare that since the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa resemble those of ordinary human beings, He cannot be the Absolute Truth.

But in this verse Śukadeva Gosvāmī emphatically points out that Lord Kṛṣṇa acts on the liberated platform of spiritual self-satisfaction. This fact is indicated here by the terms *ātma-rata,* *ātmārāma* and *akhaṇḍita.* It is inconceivable to ordinary people that a handsome young boy and a beautiful young girl enjoying romantic conjugal affairs in the forest moonlight can be engaging in pure activity, free from egoistic desire and lust. Yet while Lord Kṛṣṇa is inconceivable to ordinary persons, those who love Him can easily realize the absolute, pure nature of His activities.

One may argue that “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and that therefore the devotees of Kṛṣṇa are only imagining the Lord’s activities to be pure. This argument ignores many significant facts. For one, the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, of developing love for Kṛṣṇa, demands that a devotee strictly follow four regulative principles: no illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxication and no eating of meat, fish or eggs. When one is freed from material lust and rises to the liberated platform, beyond material desire, one realizes the absolute beauty of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This process is not theoretical: it has been practiced and completed by many thousands of great sages, who have left us their shining example and their brilliant teachings concerning the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Certainly beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, real beauty is perceived by the soul’s eye and not by the lusty eye of the material body. Therefore the Vedic literature repeatedly stresses that only those freed from material desire can see the beauty of Lord Kṛṣṇa with the eye of the pure soul, anointed with love of Godhead. It may finally be noted that upon realizing the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa one becomes free of all tinges of sex desire, a state of mind that can hardly result from meditating upon material sexual affairs.

One final note: The conjugal pastimes of Kṛṣṇa perfectly round out His qualification as the Supreme Absolute Truth. The *Vedānta* states that the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, so certainly the Absolute cannot lack any of the beautiful things of this world. It is only because romantic affairs exist in a pure, spiritual form in the Absolute that they can manifest in a perverted, material form in this world. Thus the apparent beauty of this world is not to be absolutely rejected; rather, beauty should be accepted in its pure, spiritual form.

Since the beginning of time men and women have been inspired to poetic rapture by the art of romance. Unfortunately, romance in this world usually leads to crushing disappointment, brought about by a change of heart or by death. Thus although we may at first find romantic affairs beautiful and enjoyable, they are eventually spoiled by the onslaught of material nature. Still, it is unreasonable to totally reject the concept of romance. Rather, we should accept conjugal attraction in its absolute, perfect, pure form, as it exists within God, without a tinge of material lust or selfishness. That pure conjugal attraction — the supreme beauty and pleasure of the Supreme Truth — is what we are reading about here in the pages of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**As the gopīs wandered about, their minds completely bewildered, they pointed out various signs of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. The particular gopī whom Kṛṣṇa had led into a secluded forest when He had abandoned all the other young girls began to think Herself the best of women. “My beloved has rejected all the other gopīs,” She thought, “even though they are driven by Cupid himself. He has chosen to reciprocate with Me alone.”**

### Purport

Previously all the *gopīs* had become proud of their association with Kṛṣṇa and then suddenly lost His association. Only Rādhārāṇī remained with Him. Now She has also become proud of that association and will suffer a similar fate. The Lord arranges all this to reveal the *gopīs’* unparalleled devotion for Him, a devotion whose intensity fully manifests in moments of separation.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura describes the following moving exchange:

“Rādhā says, ‘My Lord, I am being burned in the great fire of separation from You, and My life air is about to leave My body. Even with the greatest endeavor I cannot maintain My life. But You are the Lord of My life, and so You can quickly save Me simply by glancing upon Me. Please do so immediately. I beg You to save My life, not for My sake but rather for Yours. After giving up all the other *gopīs,* You’ve brought Me so far to a secluded place in the forest just to enjoy special pleasure with Me. If I die You will not be able to find conjugal happiness anywhere else. You will remember Me and thus lament in Your sorrow.’

“Kṛṣṇa replies, ‘So let Me become unhappy. What does that matter to You?’

“‘But You are most dear to Me. I will feel Your unhappiness millions of times more than You. Even if I’ve already died, I still will not be able to tolerate the pain that even one spot on the nails of Your lotus feet may experience. Indeed, to prevent such pain I am ready to throw My life away millions and millions of times. So kindly show Yourself and drive away that unhappiness.’

“‘But if Your life air is on the verge of leaving Your body, what can I do to stop that?’

“‘Simply by the touch of Your arms, which are a medicinal herb with the power to revive the dead, My body will return to its healthy, normal condition, and My life air will automatically come back and remain in My body.’

“‘But You know the forest path Yourself without My help, so why did You order Me, the king’s son and a very young and gentle boy who is to be respected? Why did You command, “Take Me wherever You wish”? Why do You anger Me like this?’

“Rādhā cries out, ‘Please show Yourself to Your wretched maidservant. Be merciful to Me! Be merciful! When I ordered You, I was overcome by sleepiness. I was so tired from playing with You. Therefore please excuse what Your poor servant said. Please don’t be angry. It was only because You treated Me like such a close friend, though I am unworthy, that I spoke like that to You.’

“‘All right, My love, I am very pleased with You, so please come to Me.’

“‘But I’ve been blinded by lamentation. I can’t see where You are. Please tell Me where You are.’”
