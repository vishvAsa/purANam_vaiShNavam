CHAPTER EIGHTY

This chapter relates how Lord Kṛṣṇa worshiped His *brāhmaṇa* friend Sudāmā, who came to His palace seeking charity, and how the two of them discussed the pastimes they had shared while living at the home of their spiritual master, Sāndīpani Muni.

The *brāhmaṇa* Sudāmā, a personal friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s, was completely free of material desires. He maintained himself and his wife with whatever came of its own accord, and thus they were poverty-stricken. One day Sudāmā’s wife, unable to find any food to prepare for her husband, went to him and asked that he visit his friend Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā and beg some charity. Sudāmā was reluctant, but when she persisted he agreed to go, reflecting that an opportunity to see the Lord was extremely auspicious. His wife begged a few handfuls of flattened rice as a gift for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and Sudāmā set off for Dvārakā.

As Sudāmā approached the palace of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s principal wife, Rukmiṇī-devī, the Lord saw him from a distance. Kṛṣṇa immediately rose from His seat on Rukmiṇī’s bed and embraced His friend with great joy. Then He sat Sudāmā down on the bed, washed his feet with His own hands and sprinkled the wash water on His head. After this He presented him with various gifts and worshiped him with incense, lamps and so on. Meanwhile, Rukmiṇī fanned the shabbily dressed *brāhmaṇa* with a yaktail whisk. All of this astonished the residents of the palace.

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa then took the hand of His friend, and the two of them reminisced about the things they had done together long ago, while living in the school of their spiritual master. Sudāmā pointed out that Kṛṣṇa engages in the pastime of acquiring an education only to set an example for human society.

को नु श्रुत्वासकृद् ब्रह्मन्नुत्तम-श्लोकसत्कथा- ।  
विरमेत विशेषज्ञो विषण्ण- काममार्गणै- ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*ko nu śrutvāsakṛd brahmann  
uttamaḥśloka-sat-kathāḥ  
virameta viśeṣa-jño  
viṣaṇṇaḥ kāma-mārgaṇaiḥ*

### Synonyms

*kaḥ* — who; *nu* — indeed; *śrutvā* — having heard; *asakṛt* — repeatedly; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *uttamaḥ*-*śloka* — of Lord Kṛṣṇa; *sat* — transcendental; *kathāḥ* — topics; *virameta* — can desist; *viśeṣa* — the essence (of life); *jñaḥ* — who knows; *viṣaṇṇaḥ* — disgusted; *kāma* — for material desire; *mārgaṇaiḥ* — with seeking.

### Translation

**O brāhmaṇa, how could anyone who knows the essence of life and is disgusted with endeavoring for sense gratification give up the transcendental topics of Lord Uttamaḥśloka after hearing them repeatedly?**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments herein that we see many persons who, even after hearing the topics of the Lord repeatedly, give up their spiritual dedication. The *ācārya* replies that the word *viśeṣa-jña* is therefore significant here. Those who have actually understood the essence of life do not give up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A further qualification is to be *viṣaṇṇaḥ kāma-mārgaṇaiḥ,* disgusted with material sense gratification. These two qualities are complementary. One who has experienced the real taste of Kṛṣṇa consciousness automatically becomes disgusted with the inferior taste of material pleasure. Such a genuine hearer of the topics of Kṛṣṇa cannot give up hearing about the Lord’s fascinating pastimes.

### Translation

**Actual speech is that which describes the qualities of the Lord, real hands are those that work for Him, a true mind is that which always remembers Him dwelling within everything moving and nonmoving, and actual ears are those that listen to sanctifying topics about Him.**

### Purport

While continuing from the previous verse to glorify the sense of hearing dedicated to the Lord, King Parīkṣit mentions the other senses also, so that we gain a complete picture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Here he declares that without any connection to Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, all the organs of the body become useless. A similar statement is made by Śaunaka Ṛṣi in the Second Canto, Third Chapter, verses 20 to 24.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī mentions that the senses should work together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In other words, whatever the eyes or the ears experience, the mind should simply remember Kṛṣṇa, who is within all things.

### Verse text

*nanu brahman bhagavataḥ  
sakhā sākṣāc chriyaḥ patiḥ  
brahmaṇyaś ca śaraṇyaś ca  
bhagavān sātvatarṣabhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*nanu* — indeed; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *bhagavataḥ* — of your exalted self; *sakhā* — the friend; *sākṣāt* — directly; *śriyaḥ* — of the supreme goddess of fortune; *patiḥ* — the husband; *brahmaṇyaḥ* — compassionate to *brāhmaṇas*; *ca* — and; *śaraṇyaḥ* — willing to give shelter; *ca* — and; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Lord; *sātvata* — of the Yādavas; *ṛṣabhaḥ* — the best.

### Translation

**\[Sudāmā’s wife said:\] O brāhmaṇa, isn’t it true that the husband of the goddess of fortune is the personal friend of your exalted self? That greatest of Yādavas, the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, is compassionate to brāhmaṇas and very willing to grant them His shelter.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains in his commentary how the *brāhmaṇa’s* wife anticipated every possible objection her husband might make to her request that he go to Lord Kṛṣṇa to beg charity. If the *brāhmaṇa* might say, “How could the husband of the goddess of fortune befriend a fallen soul like myself?” she replies by saying that Lord Kṛṣṇa is *brahmaṇya,* very favorably disposed toward the *brāhmaṇas.* If Sudāmā might claim to have no real devotion for the Lord, she replies by saying that he is a great and wise personality who would surely obtain the shelter and mercy of the Lord. If the *brāhmaṇa* might object that Lord Kṛṣṇa is equally disposed to all the countless unhappy conditioned souls suffering the fruits of their own *karma,* she replies that Lord Kṛṣṇa is especially the Lord of the devotees, and thus even if He Himself did not grant Sudāmā His mercy, certainly the devotees engaged in serving the Lord would mercifully give him some charity. Since the Lord protects the Sātvatas, the members of the Yadu dynasty, what difficulty would there be for Him to protect a humble *brāhmaṇa* like Sudāmā, and what fault would there be in His doing so?

smarataḥ pāda-kamalam  
ātmānam api yacchati

### Synonyms

*āste* — is present; *adhunā* — now; *dvāravatyām* — at Dvārakā; *bhoja*-*vṛṣṇi*-*andhaka* — of the Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas; *īśvaraḥ* — the Lord; *smarataḥ* — to one who remembers; *pāda*-*kamalam* — His lotus feet; *ātmanām* — Himself; *api* — even; *yacchati* — He gives; *kim* *nu* — what then to speak of; *artha* — economic success; *kāmān* — and sense gratification; *bhajataḥ* — to one who worships Him; *na* — not; *ati* — very much; *abhīṣṭān* — desirable; *jagat* — of the whole universe; *guruḥ* — the spiritual master.

### Translation

**Lord Kṛṣṇa is now the ruler of the Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas and is staying at Dvārakā. Since He gives even His own self to anyone who simply remembers His lotus feet, what doubt is there that He, the spiritual master of the universe, will bestow upon His sincere worshiper prosperity and material enjoyment, which are not even very desirable?**

### Purport

The *brāhmaṇa’s* wife here implies that since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the ruler of the Bhojas, Vṛṣṇis and Andhakas, if these opulent rulers merely acknowledge Sudāmā as a personal friend of Kṛṣṇa’s, they could give him everything he required.

In this connection Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments that since Lord Kṛṣṇa had at this point put aside His weapons, He no longer traveled outside His own capital of Dvārakā. Thus Śrīla Prabhupāda writes in *Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead:* “\[The *brāhmaṇa’s* wife said: \] ‘I have heard that He never leaves His capital city, Dvārakā. He is living there without outside engagements.’”

As mentioned here, material wealth and sense gratification are not very desirable. The reason for this is that in the long run they give no real satisfaction. Still, Sudāmā’s wife thought, even if Sudāmā went to Dvārakā and simply remained silent before the Lord, He would certainly give him abundant wealth, as well as shelter at His lotus feet, which was Sudāmā’s real objective.

### Translation

**\[Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued:\] When his wife thus repeatedly implored him in various ways, the brāhmaṇa thought to himself, “To see Lord Kṛṣṇa is indeed the greatest achievement in life.” Thus he decided to go, but first he told her, “My good wife, if there is anything in the house I can bring as a gift, please give it to me.”**

### Purport

Sudāmā was naturally humble, and thus although at first he was dissatisfied with his wife’s proposal, finally he settled his mind and decided to go. Now the last detail was that he had to take a gift for his friend.

### Translation

**The learned brāhmaṇa, joined by some local brāhmaṇas, passed three guard stations and went through three gateways, and then he walked by the homes of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s faithful devotees, the Andhakas and Vṛṣṇis, which ordinarily no one could do. He then entered one of the opulent palaces belonging to Lord Hari’s sixteen thousand queens, and when he did so he felt as if he were attaining the bliss of liberation.**

### Purport

When the saintly *brāhmaṇa* entered the precincts of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s palaces and then actually entered one of the palaces, he completely forgot everything else, and thus his state of mind is compared to that of one who has just achieved the bliss of spiritual liberation. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes from the *Padma Purāṇa,* *Uttara-khaṇḍa,* wherein we learn that the *brāhmaṇa* actually entered the palace of Rukmiṇī: *sa tu rukmiṇy-antaḥ-pura-dvāri kṣaṇaṁ tūṣṇīṁ sthitaḥ.* “He stood for a moment in silence at the doorway of Queen Rukmiṇī’s palace.”

**Lord Kṛṣṇa seated His friend Sudāmā upon the bed. Then the Lord, who purifies the whole world, personally offered him various tokens of respect and washed his feet, O King, after which He sprinkled the water on His own head. He anointed him with divinely fragrant sandalwood, aguru and kuṅkuma pastes and happily worshiped him with aromatic incense and arrays of lamps. After finally offering him betel nut and the gift of a cow, He welcomed him with pleasing words.**

Leaving the goddess of fortune sitting on her bed, the Lord has embraced this brāhmaṇa as if he were an older brother.**

### Translation

**The Supreme Lord said: My dear brāhmaṇa, you know well the ways of dharma. After you offered the gift of remuneration to our guru and returned home from his school, did you marry a compatible wife or not?**

### Purport

Among civilized human beings, the question of *āśrama,* or spiritual order, is significant. In other words, every human being must execute prescribed duties as a celibate student, a married man or woman, a retired person or a renunciant. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa could see that the *brāhmaṇa* was poorly dressed, He inquired if His friend had been properly married and was executing the duties of household life. Since he was not dressed as a renunciant, he would be without a suitable *āśrama* unless he were properly married.

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa here reveals that in fact He was well aware of His friend’s situation. Sudāmā was actually learned and spiritually advanced, and therefore he was not interested in ordinary sense gratification, as is the common man.

### Translation

**My dear friend, he who gives a person his physical birth is his first spiritual master, and he who initiates him as a twice-born brāhmaṇa and engages him in religious duties is indeed more directly his spiritual master. But the person who bestows transcendental knowledge upon the members of all the spiritual orders of society is one’s ultimate spiritual master. Indeed, he is as good as My own self.**

*nanu* — certainly; *artha* — of their true welfare; *kovidāḥ* — expert knowers; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *varṇāśrama*-*vatām* — among those engaged in the *varṇāśrama* system; *iha* — in this world; *ye* — who; *mayā* — by Me; *guruṇā* — as the spiritual master; *vācā* — through his words; *taranti* — cross beyond; *añjaḥ* — easily; *bhava* — of material life; *arṇavam* — the ocean.

### Translation

**Certainly, O brāhmaṇa, of all the followers of the varṇāśrama system, those who take advantage of the words I speak in My form as the spiritual master and thus easily cross over the ocean of material existence best understand their own true welfare.**

### Purport

One’s father is a natural object of reverence, as is a religious leader who initiates one into sacred ceremonies and instructs one in general wisdom. But ultimately the bona fide spiritual master, learned in the transcendental science and thus able to take one across the ocean of birth and death to the spiritual world — such a *guru* is most deserving of worship and respect, for he is the direct representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated here.

### Translation

**I, the Soul of all beings, am not as satisfied by ritual worship, brahminical initiation, penances or self-discipline as I am by faithful service rendered to one’s spiritual master.**

### Purport

The word *prajāti* here indicates either begetting good children or the second birth obtained by ritual initiation into Vedic culture. Although both of these are praiseworthy, Lord Kṛṣṇa here states that faithful service rendered to a bona fide spiritual master is still higher.

**O brāhmaṇa, do you remember what happened to us while we were living with our spiritual master? Once our guru’s wife sent us to fetch firewood, and after we entered the vast forest, O twice-born one, an unseasonal storm arose, with fierce wind and rain and harsh thunder.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that this storm arose during winter and was therefore unseasonal.

**Constantly besieged by the powerful wind and rain, we lost our way amidst the flooding waters. We simply held each other’s hands and, in great distress, wandered aimlessly about the forest.**

### Purport

Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī points out that the verb *paribabhrima* may be understood to be the prefix *pari* with either the verb *bhṛ* or *bhram.* In the case of *bhram,* it indicates that Kṛṣṇa and Sudāmā wandered all about, and in the case of *bhṛ,* which means “to carry,” it indicates that as the two young boys wandered about, they continued to carry the firewood they had secured for their spiritual master.

### Translation

**This indeed is the duty of all true disciples: to repay the debt to their spiritual master by offering him, with pure hearts, their wealth and even their very lives.**

### Purport

One engages one’s body to realize one’s purposes. The body is also the basis of the material conception of “I,” while one’s fortune is the basis of the conception of “mine.” Thus by offering everything to the spiritual master, one realizes one’s self to be an eternal servant of the Lord. The spiritual master does not exploit the disciple but rather engages him fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the disciple’s eternal benefit.

### Translation

**You boys are first-class brāhmaṇas, and I am satisfied with you. May all your desires be fulfilled, and may the Vedic mantras you have learned never lose their meaning for you, in this world or the next.**

### Purport

Cooked food left sitting for three hours is called *yāta-yāma,* indicating that it has lost its taste, and similarly if a devotee does not remain fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the transcendental knowledge that once inspired him on the spiritual path will lose its “taste,” or meaning, for him. Thus Sāndīpani Muni blesses his disciples that the Vedic *mantras,* which reveal the Absolute Truth, will never lose their meaning for them but will remain ever fresh in their minds.

### Purport

Sudāmā Brāhmaṇa wisely understands his extraordinary good fortune of having lived with Śrī Kṛṣṇa at the residence of their spiritual master. Thus whatever external difficulties they experienced were actually an expression of the Lord’s mercy, to teach the importance of service to the spiritual master.

Śrīla Prabhupāda renders the learned brāhmaṇa’s feelings as follows: “\[Sudāmā said:\] ‘My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are the Supreme Lord and the supreme spiritual master of everyone, and since I was fortunate enough to live with You in the house of our *guru,* I think I have nothing more to do in the matter of prescribed Vedic duties.’”
