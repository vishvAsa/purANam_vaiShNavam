CHAPTER SEVEN

The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced *kālakūṭa* poison. Everyone feared this poison, but Lord Śiva satisfied them by drinking it.

With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vāsuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The *prajāpatis,* seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord Śiva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord Śiva is called Āśutoṣa because he is very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning. The goddess Durgā, Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Śiva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Śiva’s prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement. Then Lord Śiva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.

na gṛhṇīmo vayaṁ puccham  
aher aṅgam amaṅgalam

### Synonyms

*tat* — that arrangement; *na* *aicchan* — not liking; *daitya*-*patayaḥ* — the leaders of the demons; *mahā*-*puruṣa* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *ceṣṭitam* — attempt; *na* — not; *gṛhṇīmaḥ* — shall take; *vayam* — all of us (the Daityas); *puccham* — the tail; *aheḥ* — of the serpent; *aṅgam* — part of the body; *amaṅgalam* — inauspicious, inferior; *svādhyāya* — with Vedic study; *śruta* — and Vedic knowledge; *sampannāḥ* — fully equipped; *prakhyātāḥ* — prominent; *janma*-*karmabhiḥ* — by birth and activities.

### Translation

**The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake. Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious. Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.**

### Purport

The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous. Moreover, Daityas must always do the opposite of the demigods. That is their nature. We have actually seen this in relation to our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words *svādhyāya-śruta-sampannāḥ.* They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious. This difference of opinion will always continue. Indeed, it has existed since days of yore. Millions of years ago, there was the same competition. The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth. If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, “Why should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it?”

In regard to the words *svādhyāya-śruta-sampannāḥ prakhyātā janma-karmabhiḥ,* another question may be raised. If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon. There are many examples in history of men like Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called Rākṣasas, or demons. One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon. That is described by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.15):

*na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ  
prapadyante narādhamāḥ  
māyayāpahṛta-jñānā  
āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ*

“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.” *Āsuraṁ bhāvam* refers to not accepting the existence of God or the transcendental instructions of the Personality of Godhead. *Bhagavad-gītā* clearly consists of transcendental instructions imparted directly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But *asuras,* instead of accepting these instructions directly, make commentaries according to their own whimsical ways and mislead everyone, without profit even for themselves. One should therefore be very careful of demoniac, godless persons. According to the words of Lord Kṛṣṇa, even if a godless demon is very well educated, he must be considered a *mūḍha, narādhama* and *māyayāpahṛta jñāna.*

### Purport

Here is evidence that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller of everything. As we have previously described, there are two classes of men — the demons and the demigods — but neither of them are supremely powerful. Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power. The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler. When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord. *Tat te ’nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam.* Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions. Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental. Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally. It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed. The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain. *Kṣitir iha vipulatare tava tiṣṭhati pṛṣṭhe.* The Lord held the great mountain on His back. *Keśava dhṛta-kūrma-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.* Dangers can be created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they can also be removed by Him. This is known to devotees, but demons cannot understand it.

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always the unlimited. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His body as a tortoise, held on His back the largest of mountains, Mandara-parvata, He did not feel any inconvenience. On the contrary, He apparently felt some itching, and thus the rotation of the mountain was certainly very pleasing.

### Translation

**Thereafter, Lord Viṣṇu entered the demons as the quality of passion, the demigods as the quality of goodness, and Vāsuki as the quality of ignorance to encourage them and increase their various types of strength and energy.**

### Purport

Everyone in this material world is under the different modes of material nature. There were three different parties in the churning of Mandara Mountain — the demigods, who were in the mode of goodness, the demons, who were in the mode of passion, and the snake Vāsuki, who was in the mode of ignorance. Since they were all becoming tired (Vāsuki so much so that he was almost going to die), Lord Viṣṇu, to encourage them to continue the work of churning the ocean, entered into them according to their respective modes of nature — goodness, passion and ignorance.

He wore a garland of flowers, and His eyes were pinkish. With His strong, glorious arms, which award fearlessness throughout the universe, He took hold of Vāsuki and began churning the ocean, using Mandara Mountain as a churning rod. When engaged in this way, the Lord appeared like a beautifully situated mountain named Indranīla.**

### Translation

**The fish, sharks, tortoises and snakes were most agitated and perturbed. The entire ocean became turbulent, and even the large aquatic animals like whales, water elephants, crocodiles and timiṅgila fish \[large whales that can swallow small whales\] came to the surface. While the ocean was being churned in this way, it first produced a fiercely dangerous poison called hālahala.**

### Translation

**O King, when that uncontrollable poison was forcefully spreading up and down in all directions, all the demigods, along with the Lord Himself, approached Lord Śiva \[Sadāśiva\]. Feeling unsheltered and very much afraid, they sought shelter of him.**

### Purport

One may question that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present, why did He accompany all the demigods and people in general to take shelter of Lord Sadāśiva instead of intervening Himself. In this connection Śrīla Madhvācārya warns:

*rudrasya yaśaso ’rthāya  
svayaṁ viṣṇur viṣaṁ vibhuḥ  
na sañjahre samartho ’pi  
vāyuṁ coce praśāntaye*

Lord Viṣṇu was competent to rectify the situation, but in order to give credit to Lord Śiva, who later drank all the poison and kept it in his neck, Lord Viṣṇu did not take action.

**The prajāpatis said: O greatest of all demigods, Mahādeva, Supersoul of all living entities and cause of their happiness and prosperity, we have come to the shelter of your lotus feet. Now please save us from this fiery poison, which is spreading all over the three worlds.**

### Purport

Since Lord Śiva is in charge of annihilation, why should he be approached for protection, which is given by Lord Viṣṇu? Lord Brahmā creates, and Lord Śiva annihilates, but both Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are incarnations of Lord Viṣṇu and are known as *śaktyāveśa-avatāras.* They are endowed with a special power like that of Lord Viṣṇu, who is actually all-pervading in their activities. Therefore whenever prayers for protection are offered to Lord Śiva, actually Lord Viṣṇu is indicated, for otherwise Lord Śiva is meant for destruction. Lord Śiva is one of the *īśvaras,* or the controllers known as *śaktyāveśa-avatāras.* Therefore he can be addressed as having the qualities of Lord Viṣṇu.

*tvam* *ekaḥ* — Your Lordship is indeed; *sarva*-*jagataḥ* — of the three worlds; *īśvaraḥ* — the controller; *bandha*-*mokṣayoḥ* — of both bondage and liberation; *tam* — that controller; *tvām* *arcanti* — worship you; *kuśalāḥ* — persons who want good fortune; *prapanna*-*ārti*-*haram* — who can mitigate all the distresses of a sheltered devotee; *gurum* — you who act as a good advisor to all fallen souls.

### Translation

**O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler. Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation. We therefore worship Your Lordship.**

### Purport

Actually Lord Viṣṇu maintains and accomplishes all good fortune. If one has to take shelter of Lord Viṣṇu, why should the demigods take shelter of Lord Śiva? They did so because Lord Viṣṇu acts through Lord Śiva in the creation of the material world. Lord Śiva acts on behalf of Lord Viṣṇu. When the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.4) that He is the father of all living entities (*ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā*), this refers to actions performed by Lord Viṣṇu through Lord Śiva. Lord Viṣṇu is always unattached to material activities, and when material activities are to be performed, Lord Viṣṇu performs them through Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is therefore worshiped on the level of Lord Viṣṇu. When Lord Viṣṇu is untouched by the external energy He is Lord Viṣṇu, but when He is in touch with the external energy, He appears in His feature as Lord Śiva.

### Translation

**You are the cause of all causes, the self-effulgent, inconceivable, impersonal Brahman, which is originally Parabrahman. You manifest various potencies in this cosmic manifestation.**

### Purport

This prayer is offered to the impersonal Brahman, which consists of the effulgent rays of Parabrahman. Parabrahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān*). When Lord Śiva is worshiped as Parabrahman, the worship is meant for Lord Viṣṇu.

### Translation

**O lord, the five important Vedic mantras are represented by your five faces, from which the thirty-eight most celebrated Vedic mantras have been generated. Your Lordship, being celebrated as Lord Śiva, is self-illuminated. You are directly situated as the supreme truth, known as Paramātmā.**

### Purport

The five *mantras* mentioned in this connection are as follows: (1) *Puruṣa,* (2) *Aghora,* (3) *Sadyojāta,* (4) *Vāmadeva,* and (5) *Īśāna.* These five *mantras* are within the category of thirty-eight special Vedic *mantras* chanted by Lord Śiva, who is therefore celebrated as Śiva or Mahādeva. Another reason why Lord Śiva is called Śiva, which means “all-auspicious,” is that he is self-illuminated, exactly like Lord Viṣṇu, who is the Paramātmā. Because Lord Śiva is directly an incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu, he is situated as Lord Viṣṇu’s direct representative. This fact is corroborated by a Vedic *mantra:* *patiṁ viśvasyātmeśvaraṁ śāśvatam.* *śivam acyutam.* The Supersoul is called by many names, of which Maheśvara, Śiva and Acyuta are especially mentioned.

### Translation

**O Lord Girīśa, since the impersonal Brahman effulgence is transcendental to the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, the various directors of this material world certainly cannot appreciate it or even know where it is. It is not understandable even to Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu or the King of heaven, Mahendra.**

### Purport

The *brahmajyoti* is actually the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.40):

*yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-  
koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam  
tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.” Although the impersonal feature of the Absolute is an expansion of the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He does not need to take care of the impersonalists who enter the *brahmajyoti.* Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4), *mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:* “In My impersonal feature I pervade this entire universe.” Thus the *avyakta-mūrti,* the impersonal feature, is certainly an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s energy. Māyāvādīs, who prefer to merge into this Brahman effulgence, worship Lord Śiva. The *mantras* referred to in text 29 are called *mukhāni pañcopaniṣadas taveśa.* Māyāvādīs take all these *mantras* seriously in worshiping Lord Śiva. These *mantras* are as follows: (1) *tat puruṣāya vidmahe śāntyai,* (2) *mahā-devāya dhīmahi vidyāyai,* (3) *tan no rudraḥ pratiṣṭhāyai,* (4) *pracodayāt dhṛtyai,* (5) *aghorebhyas tamā … ,* (6) *atha ghorebhyo mohā … ,* (7) *aghorebhyo rakṣā … ,* (8) *aghoratarebhyo nidrā … ,* (9) *sarvebhyaḥ sarva-vyādhyai,* (10) *sarva-sarvebhyo mṛtyave,* (11) *namas te ’stu kṣudhā … ,* (12) *rudra-rūpebhyas tṛṣṇā … ,* (13) *vāmadevāya rajā … ,* (14) *jyeṣṭhāya svāhā … ,* (15) *śreṣṭhāya ratyai,* (16) *rudrāya kalyāṇyai,* (17) *kālāya kāmā … ,* (18) *kala-vikaraṇāya sandhinyai,* (19) *bala-vikaraṇāya kriyā … ,* (20) *balāya vṛddhyai,* (21) *balacchāyā … ,* (22) *pramathanāya dhātryai,* (23) *sarva-bhūta-damanāya bhrāmaṇyai,* (24) *manaḥ-śoṣiṇyai,* (25) *unmanāya jvarā … ,* (26) *sadyojātaṁ prapadyāmi siddhyai,* (27) *sadyojātāya vai namaḥ ṛddhyai,* (28) *bhave dityai,* (29) *abhave lakṣmyai,* (30) *nātibhave medhā … ,* (31) *bhajasva māṁ kāntyai,* (32) *bhava svadhā … ,* (33) *udbhavāya prabhā … ,* (34) *īśānaḥ sarva-vidyānāṁ śaśinyai,* (35) *īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām abhaya-dā … ,* (36) *brahmādhipatir brahmaṇodhipatir brahman brahmeṣṭa-dā … ,* (37) *śivo me astu marīcyai,* (38) *sadāśivaḥ jvālinyai.*

The impersonal Brahman is unknown even to the other directors of the material creation, including Lord Brahmā, Lord Indra and even Lord Viṣṇu. This does not mean, however, that Lord Viṣṇu is not omniscient. Lord Viṣṇu is omniscient, but He does not need to understand what is going on in His all-pervading expansion. Therefore in *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says that although everything is an expansion of Him (*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam*), He does not need to take care of everything (*na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*), since there are various directors like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Indra.

### Synonyms

*kāma*-*adhvara* — sacrifices for sense gratification (like Dakṣa-yajña, the sacrifices performed by Dakṣa); *tripura* — the demon named Tripurāsura; *kālagara* — Kālagara; *ādi* — and others; *aneka* — many; *bhūta*-*druhaḥ* — who are meant for giving trouble to the living entities; *kṣapayataḥ* — being engaged in their destruction; *stutaye* — your prayer; *na* — not; *tat* — that; *te* — speaking to you; *yaḥ* *tu* — because; *anta*-*kāle* — at the time of annihilation; *idam* — in this material world; *ātma*-*kṛtam* — done by yourself; *sva*-*netra* — by your eyes; *vahni*-*sphuliṅga*-*śikhayā* — by the sparks of fire; *bhasitam* — burned to ashes; *na* *veda* — I do not know how it is happening.

### Translation

**When annihilation is performed by the flames and sparks emanating from your eyes, the entire creation is burned to ashes. Nonetheless, you do not know how this happens. What then is to be said of your destroying the Dakṣa-yajña, Tripurāsura and the kālakūṭa poison? Such activities cannot be subject matters for prayers offered to you.**

### Purport

Since Lord Śiva considers the great acts he performs to be very unimportant, what was to be said of counteracting the strong poison produced by the churning? The demigods indirectly prayed that Lord Śiva counteract the *kālakūṭa* poison, which was spreading throughout the universe.

*ye* — persons who; *tu* — indeed; *ātma*-*rāma*-*gurubhiḥ* — by those who are self-satisfied and who are considered to be spiritual masters of the world; *hṛdi* — within the heart; *cintita*-*aṅghri*-*dvandvam* — thinking of your two lotus feet; *carantam* — moving; *umayā* — with your consort, Umā; *tapasā* *abhitaptam* — highly advanced through practice of austerity and penance; *katthante* — criticize your acts; *ugra*-*paruṣam* — not a gentle person; *niratam* — always; *śmaśāne* — in the crematorium; *te* — such persons; *nūnam* — indeed; *ūtim* — such activities; *avidan* — not knowing; *tava* — your activities; *hāta*-*lajjāḥ* — shameless.

### Translation

**Exalted, self-satisfied persons who preach to the entire world think of your lotus feet constantly within their hearts. However, when persons who do not know your austerity see you moving with Umā, they misunderstand you to be lusty, or when they see you wandering in the crematorium they mistakenly think that you are ferocious and envious. Certainly they are shameless. They cannot understand your activities.**

### Purport

Lord Śiva is the topmost Vaiṣṇava (*vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ*). It is therefore said, *vaiṣṇavera kriyā-mudrā vijñe nā bujhaya.* Even the most intelligent person cannot understand what a Vaiṣṇava like Lord Śiva is doing or how he is acting. Those who are conquered by lusty desires and anger cannot estimate the glories of Lord Śiva, whose position is always transcendental. In all the activities associated with lusty desires, Lord Śiva is an implement of *ātma-rāma.* Ordinary persons, therefore, should not try to understand Lord Śiva and his activities. One who tries to criticize the activities of Lord Śiva is shameless.

### Translation

**Even personalities like Lord Brahmā and other demigods cannot understand your position, for you are beyond the moving and nonmoving creation. Since no one can understand you in truth, how can one offer you prayers? It is impossible. As far as we are concerned, we are creatures of Lord Brahmā’s creation. Under the circumstances, therefore, we cannot offer you adequate prayers, but as far as our ability allows, we have expressed our feelings.**

### Translation

**O greatest of all rulers, your actual identity is impossible for us to understand. As far as we can see, your presence brings flourishing happiness to everyone. Beyond this, no one can appreciate your activities. We can see this much, and nothing more.**

### Purport

When the demigods offered these prayers to Lord Śiva, their inner purpose was to please him so that he would rectify the disturbing situation created by the *hālahala* poison. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.20), *kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ:* when one worships demigods, this is certainly because of deep-rooted desires he wants fulfilled by the mercy of those demigods. People are generally attached to the worship of demigods for some motive.

### Translation

**People in general, being bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are always engaged in animosity toward one another. But devotees, even at the risk of their own temporary lives, try to save them.**

### Purport

This is the characteristic of a Vaiṣṇava. *Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī:* a Vaiṣṇava is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls unhappy. Otherwise, he would have no business teaching them how to become happy. In materialistic life, people must certainly engage in activities of animosity. Materialistic life is therefore compared to *saṁsāra-dāvānala,* a blazing forest fire that automatically takes place. Lord Śiva and his followers in the *paramparā* system try to save people from this dangerous condition of materialistic life. This is the duty of devotees following the principles of Lord Śiva and belonging to the Rudra *sampradāya.* There are four Vaiṣṇava *sampradāyas,* and the Rudra *sampradāya* is one of them because Lord Śiva (Rudra) is the best of the Vaiṣṇavas (*vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ*). Indeed, as we shall see, Lord Śiva drank all the poison for the benefit of humanity.

Although there was such a great quantity of poison that it spread all over the universe, Lord Śiva had such great power that he reduced the poison to a small quantity so that he could hold it in his palm.

### Translation

**It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s heart.**

### Purport

Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.68-69), *ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati … na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ:* “One who preaches the message of *Bhagavad-gītā* to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship.” There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of *karma* cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of *karma,* that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to *karma* and it reactions. No one can change this. Therefore the *śāstra* says:

*tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido  
na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ*

(*Bhāg.* 1.5.18)

One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of *karma.* What is that? One should endeavor to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If one tries to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham*). Again, as stated here, *tapyante loka-tāpena sādhavaḥ prāyaśo janāḥ.* The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity.

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ  
vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya  
sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.” (Bg. 4.7-8) All the *śāstras* conclude, therefore, that spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world. Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee.
