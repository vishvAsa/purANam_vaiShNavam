CHAPTER FIFTEEN

This chapter describes how Bali, after performing the Viśvajit-yajña, received the benediction of a chariot and various kinds of paraphernalia for war, with which he attacked the King of heaven. All the demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planets and went away, following the instructions of their *guru.*

Mahārāja Parīkṣit wanted to understand how Lord Vāmanadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from Bali Mahārāja, took everything away from him and arrested him. Śukadeva Gosvāmī responded to this inquiry with the following explanation. In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of Śukrācārya he regained his life. Thus he engaged himself in the service of Śukrācārya, his spiritual master. The descendants of Bhṛgu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Viśvajit-yajña. When this *yajña* was performed, from the fire of *yajña* came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows. Mahārāja Prahlāda, Bali Mahārāja’s grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and Śukrācārya gave him a conchshell. Bali Mahārāja, after offering obeisances to Prahlāda, the *brāhmaṇas* and his spiritual master, Śukrācārya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapurī with his soldiers. Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra’s kingdom. When Indra saw Bali Mahārāja’s prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, Bṛhaspati, told him about Bali’s strength, and inquired about his duty. Bṛhaspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with extraordinary power by the *brāhmaṇas,* the demigods could not fight with him. Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, there was no alternative. Under the circumstances, Bṛhaspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible. The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Mahārāja, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of Indra. The descendants of Bhṛgu Muni, being very affectionate to their disciple Bali Mahārāja, engaged him in performing one hundred *aśvamedha-yajñas.* In this way, Bali enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets.

### Translation

**Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, said: O Indra, I know the cause for your enemy’s becoming so powerful. The brāhmaṇa descendants of Bhṛgu Muni, being pleased by Bali Mahārāja, their disciple, endowed him with such extraordinary power.**

### Purport

Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, informed Indra, “Ordinarily, Bali and his forces could not achieve such strength, but it appears that the *brāhmaṇa* descendants of Bhṛgu Muni, being pleased with Bali Mahārāja, endowed them with this spiritual power.” In other words, Bṛhaspati informed Indra that Bali Mahārāja’s prowess was not his own but that of his exalted *guru,* Śukrācārya. We sing in our daily prayers, *yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi.* By the pleasure of the spiritual master, one can get extraordinary power, especially in spiritual advancement. The blessings of the spiritual master are more powerful than one’s personal endeavor for such advancement. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says:

*guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya,  
āra nā kariha mane āśā*

Especially for spiritual advancement, one should carry out the bona fide order of the spiritual master. By the *paramparā* system, one can thus be endowed with the original spiritual power coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ*).

### Translation

**Bali Mahārāja has now become extremely powerful because of the benedictions given him by the brāhmaṇas, but when he later insults the brāhmaṇas, he will be vanquished, along with his friends and assistants.**

### Purport

Bali Mahārāja and Indra were enemies. Therefore, when Bṛhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, predicted that Bali Mahārāja would be vanquished when he insulted the *brāhmaṇas* by whose grace he had become so powerful, Bali Mahārāja’s enemies were naturally anxious to know when that opportune moment would come. To pacify King Indra, Bṛhaspati assured him that the time would certainly come, for Bṛhaspati could see that in the future Bali Mahārāja would defy the orders of Śukrācārya in order to pacify Lord Viṣṇu, Vāmanadeva. Of course, to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can take all risks. To please Vāmanadeva, Bali Mahārāja risked defying the orders of his spiritual master, Śukrācārya. Because of this, he would lose all his property, yet because of devotional service to the Lord, he would get more than he expected, and in the future, in the eighth *manvantara,* he would occupy the throne of Indra again.

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The demigods, being thus advised by Bṛhaspati for their benefit, immediately accepted his words. Assuming forms according to their desire, they left the heavenly kingdom and scattered, without being observed by the demons.**

### Purport

The word *kāma-rūpiṇaḥ* indicates that the demigods, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets, can assume any form they desire. Thus it was not at all difficult for them to remain incognito before the eyes of the demons.

### Translation

**The brāhmaṇa descendants of Bhṛgu, being very pleased with their disciple, who had conquered the entire universe, now engaged him in performing one hundred aśvamedha sacrifices.**

### Purport

We have seen in the dispute between Mahārāja Pṛthu and Indra that when Mahārāja Pṛthu wanted to perform one hundred *aśvamedha-yajñas,* Indra wanted to impede him, for it is because of such great sacrifices that Indra was made King of heaven. Here the *brāhmaṇa* descendants of Bhṛgu decided that although Mahārāja Bali was situated on the throne of Indra, he would not be able to stay there unless he performed such sacrifices. Therefore they advised Mahārāja Bali to perform at least as many *aśvamedha-yajñas* as Indra. The word *ayājayan* indicates that all the *brāhmaṇas* induced Bali Mahārāja to perform such sacrifices.

### Translation

**Because of the favor of the brāhmaṇas, the great soul Bali Mahārāja, thinking himself very satisfied, became very opulent and prosperous and began to enjoy the kingdom.**

### Purport

The *brāhmaṇas* are called *dvija-deva,* and *kṣatriyas* are generally called *nara-deva.* The word *deva* actually refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The *brāhmaṇas* guide human society in becoming happy by satisfying Lord Viṣṇu, and according to their advice, the *kṣatriyas,* who are called *nara-deva,* keep law and order so that other people, namely the *vaiśyas* and *śūdras,* may properly follow regulative principles. In this way, people are gradually elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Bali Mahārāja Conquers the Heavenly Planets.”*
