CHAPTER SIXTEEN

As described in this chapter, because Aditi, the mother of the demigods, was very afflicted, her husband, Kaśyapa Muni, told her how to observe vows in austerities for the benefit of her sons.

Since the demigods were not visible in the heavenly kingdom, their mother, Aditi, because of separation from them, was very much aggrieved. One day after many, many years, the great sage Kaśyapa emerged from a trance of meditation and returned to his *āśrama.* He saw that the *āśrama* was no longer beautiful and that his wife was very morose. Everywhere in the *āśrama,* he saw signs of lamentation. The great sage therefore inquired from his wife about the well-being of the *āśrama* and asked her why she looked so morose. After Aditi informed Kaśyapa Muni about the *āśrama’s* well-being, she told him that she was lamenting for the absence of her sons. She then requested him to tell her how her sons could return and reoccupy their positions. She wanted all good fortune for her sons. Moved by Aditi’s request, Kaśyapa Muni instructed her in the philosophy of self-realization, the difference between matter and spirit, and how to be unaffected by material loss. But when he saw that Aditi was not satisfied even after he had given these instructions, he advised her to worship Vāsudeva, Janārdana. He assured her that only Lord Vāsudeva could satisfy her and fulfill all her desires. When Aditi then expressed her desire to worship Lord Vāsudeva, Prajāpati Kaśyapa told her about a process of worship known as *payo-vrata,* which is executed in twelve days. Lord Brahmā had instructed him how to satisfy Lord Kṛṣṇa by this process, and thus he advised his wife to observe this vow and its regulative principles.

Kaśyapa Muni wondered whether the regulative principles, which are meant for the well-being of everyone, had been disobeyed. He accordingly continued his inquiries for seven verses.

अपि वाकुशलं किञ्चिद् गृहेषु गृहमेधिनि ।

### Verse text

*api vākuśalaṁ kiñcid  
gṛheṣu gṛha-medhini  
dharmasyārthasya kāmasya  
yatra yogo hy ayoginām*

### Synonyms

*api* — I am wondering; *vā* — either; *akuśalam* — inauspiciousness; *kiñcit* — some; *gṛheṣu* — at home; *gṛha*-*medhini* — O my wife, who are attached to household life; *dharmasya* — of the principles of religion; *arthasya* — of the economic condition; *kāmasya* — of satisfaction of desires; *yatra* — at home; *yogaḥ* — the result of meditation; *hi* — indeed; *ayoginām* — even of those who are not transcendentalists.

### Translation

**O my wife, who are very much attached to household life, if the principles of religion, economic development and satisfaction of the senses are properly followed in household life, one’s activities are as good as those of a transcendentalist. I wonder whether there have been any discrepancies in following these principles.**

### Purport

In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Kaśyapa Muni, as *gṛha-medhini,* which means “one who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification.” Generally, those who are in household life pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results. Such *gṛhamedhīs* have only one aim in life — sense gratification. Therefore it is said, *yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham:* the householder’s life is based on sense gratification, and therefore the happiness derived from it is very meager. Nonetheless, the Vedic process is so comprehensive that even in householder life one can adjust his activities according to the regulative principles of *dharma, artha, kāma* and *mokṣa.* One’s aim should be to achieve liberation, but because one cannot at once give up sense gratification, in the *śāstras* there are injunctions prescribing how to follow the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification. As explained in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.9), *dharmasya hy āpavargyasya nārtho ’rthāyopakalpate:* “All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be performed for material gain.” Those who are in household life should not think that religion is meant to improve the process of the householder’s sense gratification. Household life is also meant for advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material clutches. One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life (*tattva jijñāsā*). Then household life is as good as the life of a *yogi.* Kaśyapa Muni therefore inquired from his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being properly followed in terms of the śāstric injunctions. As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the *śāstra,* the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion.

gṛhād apūjitā yātāḥ  
pratyutthānena vā kvacit*

### Synonyms

*api* — whether; *vā* — either; *atithayaḥ* — guests who come without an invitation; *abhyetya* — coming to the home; *kuṭumba*-*āsaktayā* — who were too attached to the family members; *tvayā* — by you; *gṛhāt* — from the house; *apūjitāḥ* — without being properly welcomed; *yātāḥ* — went away; *pratyutthānena* — by standing up; *vā* — either; *kvacit* — sometimes.

### Translation

**I wonder whether because of being too attached to the members of your family, you failed to properly receive uninvited guests, who therefore were not welcomed and went away.**

### Purport

It is the duty of a householder to receive guests, even if a guest be an enemy. When a guest comes to one’s home, one should properly receive him by standing up and offering him a seat. It is enjoined, *gṛhe śatrum api prāptaṁ viśvastam akutobhayam:* if even an enemy comes to one’s home, one should receive him in such a way that the guest will forget that his host is an enemy. According to one’s position, one should properly receive anyone who comes to one’s home. At least a seat and a glass of water should be offered, so that the guest will not be displeased. Kaśyapa Muni inquired from Aditi whether disrespect had been shown to such guests, or *atithis.* The word *atithi* refers to one who comes without an invitation.

*gṛheṣu yeṣv atithayo  
nārcitāḥ salilair api

### Synonyms

*gṛheṣu* — at home; *yeṣu* — which; *atithayaḥ* — uninvited guests; *na* — not; *arcitāḥ* — welcomed; *salilaiḥ* *api* — even by offering a glass of water; *yadi* — if; *niryānti* — they go away; *te* — such household life; *nūnam* — indeed; *pheru*-*rāja* — of jackals; *gṛha* — the homes; *upamāḥ* — like.

### Translation

**Homes from which guests go away without having been received even with an offering of a little water are like those holes in the field which are the homes of jackals.**

### Purport

In a field there may be holes made by snakes and mice, but when there are very big holes, it may be supposed that jackals live there. Certainly no one goes to take shelter in such homes. Thus the homes of human beings where *atithis,* uninvited guests, are not properly received are like the homes of jackals.

*yat-pūjayā kāma-dughān  
yāti lokān gṛhānvitaḥ  
brāhmaṇo ’gniś ca vai viṣṇoḥ

### Synonyms

*yat*-*pūjayā* — by worshiping the fire and *brāhmaṇas*; *kāma*-*dughān* — which fulfill one’s desires; *yāti* — one goes; *lokān* — to the destination of the higher planetary system; *gṛha*-*anvitaḥ* — a person attached to household life; *brāhmaṇaḥ* — the *brāhmaṇas*; *agniḥ* *ca* — and the fire; *vai* — indeed; *viṣṇoḥ* — of Lord Viṣṇu; *sarva*-*deva*-*ātmanaḥ* — the soul of all the demigods; *mukham* — the mouth.

### Translation

**By worshiping the fire and the brāhmaṇas, a householder can achieve the desired goal of residing in the higher planets, for the sacrificial fire and the brāhmaṇas are to be considered the mouth of Lord Viṣṇu, who is the Supersoul of all the demigods.**

### Purport

According to the Vedic system, a fire sacrifice is held in order to offer oblations of ghee, grains, fruits, flowers and so on, so that Lord Viṣṇu may eat and be satisfied. The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.26):

*patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ  
yo me bhaktyā prayacchati  
tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam  
aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ*

“If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.” Therefore, all these items may be offered in the sacrificial fire, and Lord Viṣṇu will be satisfied. Similarly, *brāhmaṇa-bhojana,* feeding of the *brāhmaṇas,* is also recommended, for when the *brāhmaṇas* eat sumptuous remnants of food after *yajña,* this is another way that Lord Viṣṇu Himself eats. Therefore the Vedic principles recommend that in every festival or ceremony one offer oblations to the fire and give sumptuous food for the *brāhmaṇas* to eat. By such activities, a householder may be elevated to the heavenly planets and similar places in the higher planetary systems.

śrī-aditir uvāca  
*bhadraṁ dvija-gavāṁ brahman

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*aditiḥ* *uvāca* — Śrīmatī Aditi said; *bhadram* — all auspiciousness; *dvija*-*gavām* — of the *brāhmaṇas* and the cows; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *dharmasya* *asya* — of the religious principles mentioned in *śāstra*; *janasya* — of the people in general; *ca* — and; *tri*-*vargasya* — of the three processes of elevation (*dharma, artha* and *kāma*); *param* — the supreme; *kṣetram* — field; *gṛhamedhin* — O my husband, who are attached to household life; *gṛhāḥ* — your home; *ime* — all these things.

### Translation

**Aditi said: O my respected brāhmaṇa husband, all is well with the brāhmaṇas, the cows, religion and the welfare of other people. O master of the house, the three principles of dharma, artha and kāma flourish in household life, which is consequently full of good fortune.**

### Purport

In household life one can develop the three principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification according to the regulations given in the *śāstras,* but to attain liberation one must give up household life and place himself in the transcendental renounced order. Kaśyapa Muni was not in the renounced order of life. Therefore he is addressed here once as *brahman* and another time as *gṛhamedhin.* Aditi, his wife, assured him that as far as household life was concerned, everything was going nicely, and the *brāhmaṇas* and cows were being honored and protected. In other words, there were no disturbances; household life was duly progressing.

### Synonyms

*tava* — your; *eva* — indeed; *mārīca* — O son of Marīci; *manaḥ*-*śarīra*-*jāḥ* — born either of your body or of your mind (all the demons and demigods); *prajāḥ* — born of you; *imāḥ* — all of them; *sattva*-*rajaḥ*-*tamaḥ*-*juṣaḥ* — infected with *sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* or *tamo-guṇa*; *samaḥ* — equal; *bhavān* — your good self; *tāsu* — to every one of them; *asura*-*ādiṣu* — beginning with the *asuras*; *prabho* — O my lord; *tathā* *api* — still; *bhaktam* — unto the devotees; *bhajate* — takes care of; *mahā*-*īśvaraḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller.

### Translation

But although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, is equal toward all living entities, He is especially favorable to the devotees.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29) the Lord says:

*samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu  
na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ  
ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā  
mayi te teṣu cāpy aham*

Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward those who engage in His devotional service. The Lord says, *kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati:* “My dear son of Kuntī, please declare that My devotee will never be vanquished.” Elsewhere, Kṛṣṇa also says:

*ye yathā māṁ prapadyante  
tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham  
mama vartmānuvartante  
manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ*

(Bg. 4.11)

Actually, everyone is trying to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in various ways, but according to their methods of approach, the Supreme Lord endows them with different benedictions. Thus Aditi appealed to her husband by saying that since even the supreme controller favors His devotees and since Indra, Kaśyapa’s devoted son, was in difficulty, Kaśyapa should bestow his favor upon Indra.

### Verse text

*kva deho bhautiko ’nātmā  
kva cātmā prakṛteḥ paraḥ  
kasya ke pati-putrādyā  
moha eva hi kāraṇam*

### Synonyms

*kva* — where is; *dehaḥ* — this material body; *bhautikaḥ* — made of five elements; *anātmā* — not the spirit soul; *kva* — where is; *ca* — also; *ātmā* — the spirit soul; *prakṛteḥ* — to the material world; *paraḥ* — transcendental; *kasya* — of whom; *ke* — who is; *pati* — husband; *putra*-*ādyāḥ* — or son and so on; *mohaḥ* — illusion; *eva* — indeed; *hi* — certainly; *kāraṇam* — cause.

### Translation

**Kaśyapa Muni continued: What is this material body, made of five elements? It is different from the spirit soul. Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body is made. But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son. These illusory relationships are caused by misunderstanding.**

### Purport

The spirit soul (*ātmā* or *jīva*) is certainly different from the body, which is a combination of five material elements. This is a simple fact, but it is not understood unless one is spiritually educated. Kaśyapa Muni met his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, but the same misconception extends throughout the entire universe and is also here on earth. There are different grades of living entities, but all of them are more or less under the impression of the bodily conception of life. In other words, all living entities in this material world are more or less devoid of spiritual education. The Vedic civilization, however, is based on spiritual education, and spiritual education is the special basis on which *Bhagavad-gītā* was spoken to Arjuna. In the beginning of *Bhagavad-gītā,* Kṛṣṇa instructed Arjuna to understand that the spirit soul is different from the body.

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe  
kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir  
dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13) Unfortunately, this spiritual education is completely absent from modern human civilization. No one understands his real self-interest, which lies with the spirit soul, not with the material body. Education means spiritual education. To work hard in the bodily conception of life, without spiritual education, is to live like an animal. *Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate vid-bhujāṁ ye* (*Bhāg.* 5.5.1). People are working so hard simply for bodily comforts, without education regarding the spirit soul. Thus they are living in a very risky civilization, for it is a fact that the spirit soul has to transmigrate from one body to another (*tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ*). Without spiritual education, people are kept in dark ignorance and do not know what will happen to them after the annihilation of the present body. They are working blindly, and blind leaders are directing them. *Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te ’pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ* (*Bhāg.* 7.5.31). A foolish person does not know that he is completely under the bondage of material nature and that after death material nature will impose upon him a certain type of body, which he will have to accept. He does not know that although in his present body he may be a very important man, he may next get the body of an animal or tree because of his ignorant activities in the modes of material nature. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to give the true light of spiritual existence to all living entities. This movement is not very difficult to understand, and people must take advantage of it, for it will save them from the risky life of irresponsibility.

उपतिष्ठस्व पुरुषं भगवन्तं जनार्दनम् ।  
सर्वभूतगुहावासं वासुदेवं जगद्गुरुम् ॥ २० ॥

### Verse text

*upatiṣṭhasva puruṣaṁ  
bhagavantaṁ janārdanam  
sarva-bhūta-guhā-vāsaṁ  
vāsudevaṁ jagad-gurum*

### Synonyms

*upatiṣṭhasva* — just try to worship; *puruṣam* — the Supreme Person; *bhagavantam* — the Personality of Godhead; *janārdanam* — who can kill all the enemies; *sarva*-*bhūta*-*guhā*-*vāsam* — living within the core of the heart of everyone; *vāsudevam* — Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, who is all-pervading and is the son of Vasudeva; *jagat*-*gurum* — the spiritual master and teacher of the whole world.

### Translation

**My dear Aditi, engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the master of everything, who can subdue everyone’s enemies, and who sits within everyone’s heart. Only that Supreme Person — Kṛṣṇa, or Vāsudeva — can bestow all auspicious benedictions upon everyone, for He is the spiritual master of the universe.**

### Purport

With these words, Kaśyapa Muni tried to pacify his wife. Aditi made her appeal to her material husband. Of course, that is nice, but actually a material relative cannot do anything good for anyone. If anything good can be done, it is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. Therefore, Kaśyapa Muni advised his wife, Aditi, to begin worshiping Lord Vāsudeva, who is situated in everyone’s heart. He is the friend of everyone and is known as Janārdana because He can kill all enemies. There are three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — and above material nature, transcendental to material nature, is another existence, which is called *śuddha-sattva.* In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered the best, but because of material contamination, even the mode of goodness is sometimes overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance. But when one transcends the competition between these modes and engages himself in devotional service, he rises above the three modes of material nature. In that transcendental position, one is situated in pure consciousness. *Sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vasudeva-śabditam* (*Bhāg.* 4.3.23). Above material nature is the position called *vasudeva,* or freedom from material contamination. Only in that position can one perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. Thus the *vasudeva* condition fulfills a spiritual necessity. *Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.* When one realizes Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes most exalted.

Paramātmā (Vāsudeva) is situated in everyone’s heart, as confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā.* The Lord says:

*teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ  
bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam  
dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ  
yena mām upayānti te*

“To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.” (Bg. 10.10)

*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati*

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna.” (Bg. 18.61)

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ  
sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

“The sage who knows Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.” (Bg. 5.29)

Whenever one is perplexed, let him take shelter of the lotus feet of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, who will give the devotee intelligence to help him surpass all difficulties and return home, back to Godhead. Kaśyapa Muni advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, so that all her problems would be very easily solved. Thus Kaśyapa Muni was an ideal spiritual master. He was not so foolish that he would present himself as an exalted personality, as good as God. He was actually a bona fide *guru* because he advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Vāsudeva. One who trains his subordinate or disciple to worship Vāsudeva is the truly bona fide spiritual master. The word *jagad-gurum* is very important in this regard. Kaśyapa Muni did not falsely declare himself to be *jagad-guru,* although he actually was *jagad-guru* because he advocated the cause of Vāsudeva. Actually, Vāsudeva is *jagad-guru,* as clearly stated here (*vāsudevaṁ jagad-gurum*). One who teaches the instructions of Vāsudeva, *Bhagavad-gītā,* is as good as *vāsudevaṁ jagad-gurum.* But when one who does not teach this instruction — as it is — declares himself *jagad-guru,* he simply cheats the public. Kṛṣṇa is *jagad-guru,* and one who teaches the instruction of Kṛṣṇa as it is, on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, may be accepted as *jagad-guru.* One who manufactures his own theories cannot be accepted; he becomes *jagad-guru* falsely.

### Verse text

*sa vidhāsyati te kāmān  
harir dīnānukampanaḥ

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — he (Vāsudeva); *vidhāsyati* — will undoubtedly fulfill; *te* — your; *kāmān* — desires; *hariḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *dīna* — unto the poor; *anukampanaḥ* — very merciful; *amoghā* — infallible; *bhagavat*-*bhaktiḥ* — devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *na* — not; *itarā* — anything but *bhagavad-bhakti*; *iti* — thus; *matiḥ* — opinion; *mama* — my.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is very merciful to the poor, will fulfill all of your desires, for devotional service unto Him is infallible. Any method other than devotional service is useless. That is my opinion.**

### Purport

There are three kinds of men, who are called *akāma, mokṣa-kāma* and *sarva-kāma.* One who tries to get liberation from this material world is called *mokṣa-kāma,* one who wants to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent is called *sarva-kāma,* and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material desires is called *akāma.* A *bhakta* has no desire. *Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam*. He is purified and free from material desires. The *mokṣa-kāmī* wants to achieve liberation by merging into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is not yet pure. And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the *karmīs,* who have so many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the *śāstra* says:

*akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā  
mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ  
tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena  
yajeta puruṣaṁ param*

“Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.” (*Bhāg.* 2.3.10)

Kaśyapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a *karmī, jñānī, yogī* or *bhakta,* should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of Vāsudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled. Kṛṣṇa is *dīna-anukampana:* He is very merciful to everyone. Therefore if one wants to fulfill his material desires, Kṛṣṇa helps him. Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed devotional service. It is said in *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Madhya* 22.38-39):

*kṛṣṇa kahe, — ‘āmā bhaje, māge viṣaya-sukha  
amṛta chāḍi’ viṣa māge — ei baḍa mūrkha  
āmi — vijña, ei mūrkhe ‘viṣaya’ kene diba?  
sva-caraṇāmṛta diyā ‘viṣaya’ bhulāiba*

“Kṛṣṇa says, ‘If one engages in My transcendental loving service but at the same time wants the opulence of material enjoyment, he is very, very foolish. Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up ambrosia to drink poison. Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.’” If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely desires to engage at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and take away all his material desires and possessions. This is the Lord’s special favor to devotees. Otherwise, if one takes to Kṛṣṇa’s devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from all material desires, as Dhruva Mahārāja did, but this may take some time. However, if a very sincere devotee wants only Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet, Kṛṣṇa directly gives him the position of *śuddha-bhakti,* unalloyed devotional service.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*aditiḥ* *uvāca* — Śrīmatī Aditi began to pray; *kena* — by which; *aham* — I; *vidhinā* — by regulative principles; *brahman* — O *brāhmaṇa*; *upasthāsye* — can please; *jagat*-*patim* — the Lord of the universe, Jagannātha; *yathā* — by which; *me* — my; *satya*-*saṅkalpaḥ* — desire may actually be fulfilled; *vidadhyāt* — may fulfill; *saḥ* — He (the Supreme Lord); *manoratham* — ambitions or desires.

### Translation

**Śrīmatī Aditi said: O brāhmaṇa, tell me the regulative principles by which I may worship the supreme master of the world so that He will be pleased with me and fulfill all my desires.**

### Purport

It is said, “Man proposes, God disposes.” Thus a person may desire many things, but unless these desires are fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be fulfilled. Fulfillment of desire is called *satya-saṅkalpa.* Here the word *satya-saṅkalpa* is very important. Aditi placed herself at the mercy of her husband so that he would give her directions by which to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that all her desires would be fulfilled. A disciple must first decide that he should worship the Supreme Lord, and then the spiritual master will give the disciple correct directions. One cannot dictate to the spiritual master, just as a patient cannot demand that his physician prescribe a certain type of medicine. Here is the beginning of worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.16):

*catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ  
janāḥ sukṛtino ’rjuna  
ārto jijñāsur arthārthī  
jñānī ca bharatarṣabha*

“O best among the Bhāratas, four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me — the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.” Aditi was *ārta,* a person in distress. She was very much aggrieved because her sons, the demigods, were bereft of everything. Thus she wanted to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead under the direction of her husband, Kaśyapa Muni.

### Translation

**O best of the brāhmaṇas, kindly instruct me in the perfect method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service, by which the Lord may very soon be pleased with me and save me, along with my sons, from this most dangerous condition.**

### Purport

Sometimes less intelligent men ask whether one has to approach a *guru* to be instructed in devotional service for spiritual advancement. The answer is given here — indeed, not only here, but also in *Bhagavad-gītā,* where Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as his *guru* (*śiṣyas te ’haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam*). The *Vedas* also instruct, *tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa guruṁ evābhigacchet:* one must accept a *guru* for proper direction if one is seriously inclined toward advancement in spiritual life. The Lord says that one must worship the *ācārya,* who is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyāt*). One should definitely understand this. In *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* it is said that the *guru* is the manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, according to all the evidence given by the *śāstra* and by the practical behavior of devotees, one must accept a *guru.* Aditi accepted her husband as her *guru,* so that he would direct her how to advance in spiritual consciousness, devotional service, by worshiping the Supreme Lord.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*kaśyapaḥ* *uvāca* — Kaśyapa Muni said; *etat* — this; *me* — by me; *bhagavān* — the most powerful; *pṛṣṭaḥ* — when he was requested; *prajā*-*kāmasya* — desiring offspring; *padma*-*jaḥ* — Lord Brahmā, who was born of a lotus flower; *yat* — whatever; *āha* — he said; *te* — unto you; *pravakṣyāmi* — I shall explain; *vratam* — in the form of worship; *keśava*-*toṣaṇam* — by which Keśava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is satisfied.

### Translation

**Śrī Kaśyapa Muni said: When I desired offspring, I placed inquiries before Lord Brahmā, who is born from a lotus flower. Now I shall explain to you the same process Lord Brahmā instructed me, by which Keśava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is satisfied.**

### Purport

Here the process of devotional service is further explained. Kaśyapa Muni wanted to instruct Aditi in the same process recommended to him by Brahmā for satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is valuable. The *guru* does not manufacture a new process to instruct the disciple. The disciple receives from the *guru* an authorized process received by the *guru* from his *guru.* This is called the system of disciplic succession (*evaṁ paramparā-prāptaṁ imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ*). This is the bona fide Vedic system of receiving the process of devotional service, by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased. Therefore, to approach a bona fide *guru,* or spiritual master, is essential. The bona fide spiritual master is he who has received the mercy of his *guru,* who in turn is bona fide because he has received the mercy of his *guru.* This is called the *paramparā* system. Unless one follows this *paramparā* system, the *mantra* one receives will be chanted for no purpose. Nowadays there are so many rascal *gurus* who manufacture their *mantras* as a process for material advancement, not spiritual advancement. Still, the *mantra* cannot be successful if it is manufactured. *Mantras* and the process of devotional service have special power, provided they are received from the authorized person.

### Translation

**In the bright fortnight of the month of Phālguna \[February and March\], for twelve days ending with Dvādaśī, one should observe the vow of subsisting only on milk and should worship the lotus-eyed Supreme Personality of Godhead with all devotion.**

### Purport

Worshiping the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu with devotion means following *arcana-mārga.*

*śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ  
smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam  
arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ  
sakhyam ātma-nivedanam*

One should install the Deity of Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa and worship Him nicely by dressing Him, decorating Him with flower garlands, and offering Him all kinds of fruits, flowers and cooked food, nicely prepared with ghee, sugar and grains. One should also offer a flame, incense and so on, while ringing a bell, as prescribed. This is called worship of the Lord. Here it is recommended that one observe the vow of subsisting only by drinking milk. This is called *payo-vrata.* As we generally perform devotional service on Ekādaśī by not eating grains, it is generally recommended that on Dvādaśī one not consume anything but milk. *Payo-vrata* and *arcana* devotional service to the Supreme Lord should be performed with a pure devotional attitude (*bhaktyā*). Without *bhakti,* one cannot worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ.* If one wants to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be directly connected with Him, knowing what He wants to eat and how He is satisfied, one must take to the process of *bhakti.* As recommended here also, *bhaktyā paramayānvitaḥ:* one should be surcharged with unalloyed devotional service.

These are the subject matter of *sāṅkhya-yoga,* which was inaugurated by Lord Kapiladeva. This *sāṅkhya-yoga* was again propounded by another Kapila, but he was an atheist, and his system is not accepted as bona fide.

*dakṣiṇāṁ gurave dadyād  
ṛtvigbhyaś ca yathārhataḥ  
annādyenāśva-pākāṁś ca

### Synonyms

*dakṣiṇām* — some contribution of money or gold; *gurave* — unto the spiritual master; *dadyāt* — one should give; *ṛtvigbhyaḥ* *ca* — and to the priests engaged by the spiritual master; *yathā*-*arhataḥ* — as far as possible; *anna*-*adyena* — by distributing *prasāda*; *āśva*-*pākān* — even to the *caṇḍālas,* persons habituated to eating the flesh of dogs; *ca* — also; *prīṇayet* — one should please; *samupāgatān* — because they have assembled there for the ceremony.

### Translation

**One should satisfy the spiritual master and assistant priests by giving them cloth, ornaments, cows and also some monetary contribution. And by distributing prasāda one should satisfy everyone assembled, including even the lowest of men, the caṇḍālas \[eaters of dog flesh\].**

### Purport

In the Vedic system, *prasāda* is distributed, as recommended here, without discrimination as to who may take the *prasāda.* Regardless of whether one be a *brāhmaṇa, śūdra, vaiśya, kṣatriya,* or even the lowest of men, a *caṇḍāla,* he should be welcome to accept *prasāda.* However, when the *caṇḍālas,* the lower class or poorer class, are taking *prasāda,* this does not mean that they have become Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu. Nārāyaṇa is situated in everyone’s heart, but this does not mean Nārāyaṇa is a *caṇḍāla* or poor man. The Māyāvāda philosophy of accepting a poor man as Nārāyaṇa is the most envious and atheistic movement in Vedic culture. This mentality should be completely given up. Everyone should be given the opportunity to take *prasāda,* but this does not mean that everyone has the right to become Nārāyaṇa.

### Purport

*Ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param.* This is a statement made by Lord Śiva to Pārvatī. Worshiping Lord Viṣṇu is the supreme process of worship. And how Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in this *payo-vrata* ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Viṣṇu by *varṇāśrama-dharma.* The Vedic principles of four *varṇas* and four *āśramas* are meant for worship of Viṣṇu (*viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam*). The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also *viṣṇu-ārādhanam,* or worship of Lord Viṣṇu, according to the age. The *payo-vrata* method of *viṣṇu-ārādhanam* was enunciated long, long ago by Kaśyapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this Age of Kali, the process accepted by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Viṣṇu temples (temples of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Jagannātha, Balarāma, Sītā-Rāma, Gaura-Nitāi and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Viṣṇu and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the *payo-vrata* ceremony recommended here. The *payo-vrata* ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing *kīrtana,* chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* offering palatable food to Lord Viṣṇu and distributing this food to Vaiṣṇavas and others. These are authorized activities, and if the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the *payo-vrata* ceremony. Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing *yajña,* giving in charity, observing *vratas,* and undergoing austerities, is included in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Viṣṇu. *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ:* in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* One should follow this process conscientiously.

### Translation

**This is the best process for pleasing the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as Adhokṣaja. It is the best of all regulative principles, the best austerity, the best process of giving charity, and the best process of sacrifice.**

### Purport

The Supreme Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya  
mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo  
mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Unless one pleases the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to His demand, no good result will come from any of his actions.

*dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ  
viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ  
notpādayed yadi ratiṁ  
śrama eva hi kevalam*

“The occupational activities a man performs according to his own position are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Personality of Godhead.” (*Bhāg.* 1.2.8) If one is not interested in satisfying Lord Viṣṇu, Vāsudeva, all his so-called auspicious activities are fruitless. *Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ:* because he is bewildered, he is baffled in his hopes, baffled in his activities, and baffled in his knowledge. In this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī remarks, *napuṁsakam anapuṁsakenety-ādinaikatvam.* One cannot equate the potent and the impotent. Among modern Māyāvādīs it has become fashionable to say that whatever one does or whatever path one follows is all right. But these are all foolish statements. Here it is forcefully affirmed that this is the only method for success in life. *Īśvara-tarpaṇaṁ vinā sarvam eva viphalam.* Unless Lord Viṣṇu is satisfied, all of one’s pious activities, ritualistic ceremonies and *yajñas* are simply for show and have no value. Unfortunately, foolish people do not know the secret of success. *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.* They do not know that real self-interest ends in pleasing Lord Viṣṇu.
