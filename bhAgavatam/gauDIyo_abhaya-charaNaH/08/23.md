CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE

This chapter describes how Bali Mahārāja, along with his grandfather Prahlāda Mahārāja, entered the planet Sutala and how the Supreme Personality of Godhead allowed Indra to reenter the heavenly planet.

The great soul Bali Mahārāja experienced that the highest gain in life is to attain devotional service under the shelter of the Lord’s lotus feet in full surrender. Being fixed in this conclusion, his heart full of ecstatic devotion and his eyes full of tears, he offered obeisances to the Personality of Godhead and then, with his associates, entered the planet known as Sutala. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfied the desire of Aditi and reinstalled Lord Indra. Prahlāda Mahārāja, being aware of Bali’s release from arrest, then described the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world. Prahlāda Mahārāja praised the Supreme Lord for creating the material world, for being equal to everyone and for being extremely liberal to the devotees, just like a desire tree. Indeed, Prahlāda Mahārāja said that the Lord is kind not only to His devotees but also to the demons. In this way he described the unlimited causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, with folded hands, he offered his respectful obeisances unto the Lord, and after circumambulating the Lord he also entered the planet Sutala in accordance with the Lord’s order. The Lord then ordered Śukrācārya to describe Bali Mahārāja’s faults and discrepancies in executing the sacrificial ceremony. Śukrācārya became free from fruitive actions by chanting the holy name of the Lord, and he explained how chanting can diminish all the faults of the conditioned soul. He then completed Bali Mahārāja’s sacrificial ceremony. All the great saintly persons accepted Lord Vāmanadeva as the benefactor of Lord Indra because He had returned Indra to his heavenly planet. They accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the maintainer of all the affairs of the universe. Being very happy, Indra, along with his associates, placed Vāmanadeva before him and reentered the heavenly planet in their airplane. Having seen the wonderful activities of Lord Viṣṇu in the sacrificial arena of Bali Mahārāja, all the demigods, saintly persons, Pitās, Bhūtas and Siddhas glorified the Lord again and again. The chapter concludes by saying that the most auspicious function of the conditioned soul is to chant and hear about the glorious activities of Lord Viṣṇu.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*baliḥ* *uvāca* — Bali Mahārāja said; *aho* — alas; *praṇāmāya* — to offer my respectful obeisances; *kṛtaḥ* — I did; *samudyamaḥ* — only an endeavor; *prapanna*-*bhakta*-*artha*-*vidhau* — in the regulative principles observed by pure devotees; *samāhitaḥ* — is capable; *yat* — that; *loka*-*pālaiḥ* — by the leaders of various planets; *tvat*-*anugrahaḥ* — Your causeless mercy; *amaraiḥ* — by the demigods; *alabdha*-*pūrvaḥ* — not achieved previously; *apasade* — unto a fallen person like me; *asure* — belonging to the *asura* community; *arpitaḥ* — endowed.

### Translation

**Bali Mahārāja said: What a wonderful effect there is in even attempting to offer respectful obeisances to You! I merely endeavored to offer You obeisances, but nonetheless the attempt was as successful as those of pure devotees. The causeless mercy You have shown to me, a fallen demon, was never achieved even by the demigods or the leaders of the various planets.**

### Purport

When Vāmanadeva appeared before Bali Mahārāja, Bali Mahārāja immediately wanted to offer Him respectful obeisances, but he was unable to do so because of the presence of Śukrācārya and other demoniac associates. The Lord is so merciful, however, that although Bali Mahārāja did not actually offer obeisances but only endeavored to do so within his mind, the Supreme Personality of Godhead blessed him with more mercy than even the demigods could ever expect. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.40), *svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt:* “Even a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as *bhāva-grāhī janārdana* because He takes only the essence of a devotee’s attitude. If a devotee sincerely surrenders, the Lord, as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, immediately understands this. Thus even though, externally, a devotee may not render full service, if he is internally sincere and serious the Lord welcomes his service nonetheless. Thus the Lord is known as *bhāva-grāhī janārdana* because He takes the essence of one’s devotional mentality.

### Translation

**Prahlāda Mahārāja said: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are universally worshiped; even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva worship Your lotus feet. Yet although You are such a great personality, You have kindly promised to protect us, the demons. I think that such kindness has never been achieved even by Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva or the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, what to speak of other demigods or common people.**

### Purport

The word *durga-pāla* is significant. The word *durga* means “that which does not go very easily.” Generally *durga* refers to a fort, which one cannot very easily enter. Another meaning of *durga* is “difficulty.” Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead promised to protect Bali Mahārāja and his associates from all dangers, He is addressed here as *durga-pāla,* the Lord who gives protection from all miserable conditions.

### Synonyms

*citram* — very wonderful; *tava* *īhitam* — all Your activities; *aho* — alas; *amita* — unlimited; *yoga*-*māyā* — of Your spiritual potency; *līlā* — by the pastimes; *visṛṣṭa*-*bhuvanasya* — of Your Lordship, by whom all the universes have been created; *viśāradasya* — of Your Lordship, who are expert in all respects; *sarva*-*ātmanaḥ* — of Your Lordship, who pervade all; *sama*-*dṛśaḥ* — and who are equal toward all; *aviṣamaḥ* — without differentiation; *svabhāvaḥ* — that is Your characteristic; *bhakta*-*priyaḥ* — under the circumstances You become favorable to the devotees; *yat* — because; *asi* — You are; *kalpataru*-*svabhāvaḥ* — having the characteristic of a desire tree.

### Translation

**O my Lord, Your pastimes are all wonderfully performed by Your inconceivable spiritual energy; and by her perverted reflection, the material energy, You have created all the universes. As the Supersoul of all living entities, You are aware of everything, and therefore You are certainly equal toward everyone. Nonetheless, You favor Your devotees. This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one’s desire.**

### Purport

The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29):

*samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu  
na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ  
ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā  
mayi te teṣu cāpy aham*

“I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly equal toward all living entities, but a devotee who fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord is different from a nondevotee. In other words, everyone can take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord to enjoy equal benedictions from the Lord, but nondevotees do not do so, and therefore they suffer the consequences created by the material energy. We can understand this fact by a simple example. The king or government is equal to all citizens. Therefore, if a citizen capable of receiving special favors from the government is offered such favors, this does not mean that the government is partial. One who knows how to receive favors from the authority can receive them, but one who does not neglects these favors and does not receive them. There are two classes of men — the demons and the demigods. The demigods are fully aware of the Supreme Lord’s position, and therefore they are obedient to Him, but even if demons know about the supremacy of the Lord they purposely defy His authority. Therefore, the Lord makes distinctions according to the mentality of the living being, but otherwise He is equal to everyone. Like a desire tree, the Lord fulfills the desires of one who takes shelter of Him, but one who does not take such shelter is distinct from the surrendered soul. One who takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is favored by the Lord, regardless of whether such a person is a demon or a demigod.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead assured Prahlāda Mahārāja: You shall be able to see Me there in My usual feature with conchshell, disc, club and lotus in My hand. Because of your transcendental bliss due to always personally seeing Me, you will have no further bondage to fruitive activities.**

### Purport

*Karma-bandha,* the bondage of fruitive activities, entails the repetition of birth and death. One performs fruitive activities in such a way that he creates another body for his next life. As long as one is attached to fruitive activities, he must accept another material body. This repeated acceptance of material bodies is called *saṁsāra-bandhana.* To stop this, a devotee is advised to see the Supreme Lord constantly. The *kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,* or neophyte devotee, is therefore advised to visit the temple every day and see the form of the Lord regularly. Thus the neophyte devotee can be freed from the bondage of fruitive activities.

### Translation

**O best of the brāhmaṇas, Śukrācārya, please describe the fault or discrepancy in your disciple Bali Mahārāja, who engaged in performing sacrifices. This fault will be nullified when judged in the presence of qualified brāhmaṇas.**

### Purport

When Bali Mahārāja and Prahlāda Mahārāja had departed for the planet Sutala, Lord Viṣṇu asked Śukrācārya what the fault was in Bali Mahārāja for which Śukrācārya had cursed him. It might be argued that since Bali Mahārāja had now left the scene, how could his faults be judged? In reply to this, Lord Viṣṇu informed Śukrācārya that there was no need for Bali Mahārāja’s presence, for his faults and discrepancies could be nullified if judged before the *brāhmaṇas.* As will be seen in the next verse, Bali Mahārāja had no faults; Śukrācārya had unnecessarily cursed him. Nonetheless, this was better for Bali Mahārāja. Being cursed by Śukrācārya, Bali Mahārāja was deprived of all his possessions, with the result that the Supreme Personality of Godhead favored him for his strong faith in devotional service. Of course, a devotee is not required to engage in fruitive activities. As stated in the *śāstra, sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā* (*Bhāg.* 4.31.14). By worshiping Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one satisfies everyone. Because Bali Mahārāja had satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there were no discrepancies in his performance of sacrifices.

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29) the Lord says, *bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram:* the Lord, the supreme proprietor, is the actual person to be satisfied by the performance of *yajñas.* The *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (3.8.9) says:

*varṇāśramācāravatā  
puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān  
viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā  
nanyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam*

All the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices are performed for the purpose of satisfying Lord Viṣṇu, the *yajña-puruṣa.* The divisions of society — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* — are all meant to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. To act according to this principle of the *varṇāśrama* institution is called *varṇāśramācaraṇa.* In *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.13), Sūta Gosvāmī says:

*ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā  
varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ  
svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya  
saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam*

“O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging his prescribed duties according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the Personality of Godhead.” Everything is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, since Bali Mahārāja had satisfied the Lord, he had no faults, and Śukrācārya admitted that cursing him was not good.

मन्त्रतस्तन्त्रतश्छिद्रं देशकालार्हवस्तुत- ।  
सर्वं करोति निश्छिद्रमनुसङ्कीर्तनं तव ॥ १६ ॥

### Verse text

*mantratas tantrataś chidraṁ  
deśa-kālārha-vastutaḥ  
sarvaṁ karoti niśchidram  
anusaṅkīrtanaṁ tava*

### Synonyms

*mantrataḥ* — in pronouncing the Vedic *mantras* improperly; *tantrataḥ* — in insufficient knowledge for following regulative principles; *chidram* — discrepancy; *deśa* — in the matter of country; *kāla* — and time; *arha* — and recipient; *vastutaḥ* — and paraphernalia; *sarvam* — all these; *karoti* — makes; *niśchidram* — without discrepancy; *anusaṅkīrtanam* — constantly chanting the holy name; *tava* — of Your Lordship.

### Translation

**There may be discrepancies in pronouncing the mantras and observing the regulative principles, and, moreover, there may be discrepancies in regard to time, place, person and paraphernalia. But when Your Lordship’s holy name is chanted, everything becomes faultless.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended:

*harer nāma harer nāma  
harer nāmaiva kevalam  
kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva  
nāsty eva gatir anyathā*

“In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.” (*Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa* 38.126) In this Age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices perfectly. Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic *mantras* with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the paraphernalia for Vedic performances. Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is *saṅkīrtana,* constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord. *Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ* (*Bhāg.* 11.5.29). Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord’s holy name and thus perform sacrifice perfectly. I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing *yajñas* and spending hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances. This is a lesson for those who unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices. We should take the advice of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu (*yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ*). Although Śukrācārya was a strict *brāhmaṇa* addicted to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, *niśchidram anusaṅkīrtanaṁ tava:* “My Lord, constant chanting of the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect.” In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot be performed as perfectly as before. Therefore Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has recommended that although one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we therefore give special stress to the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* in all activities.

### Translation

**One who is subject to death cannot measure the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Trivikrama, Lord Viṣṇu, any more than he can count the number of atoms on the entire planet earth. No one, whether born already or destined to take birth, is able to do this. This has been sung by the great sage Vasiṣṭha.**

### Purport

Vasiṣṭha Muni has given a *mantra* about Lord Viṣṇu: *na te viṣṇor jāyamāno na jāto mahimnaḥ pāram anantam āpa.* No one can estimate the extent of the uncommonly glorious activities of Lord Viṣṇu. Unfortunately, there are so-called scientists who are subject to death at every moment but are trying to understand by speculation the wonderful creation of the cosmos. This is a foolish attempt. Long, long ago, Vasiṣṭha Muni said that no one in the past could measure the glories of the Lord and that no one can do so in the future. One must simply be satisfied with seeing the glorious activities of the Supreme Lord’s creation. The Lord therefore says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.42), *viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthito jagat:* “With a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire universe.” The material world consists of innumerable universes, each one full of innumerable planets, which are all considered to be products of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s material energy. Yet this is only one fourth of God’s creation. The other three fourths of creation constitute the spiritual world. Among the innumerable planets in only one universe, the so-called scientists cannot understand even the moon and Mars, but they try to defy the creation of the Supreme Lord and His uncommon energy. Such men have been described as crazy. *Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma* (*Bhāg.* 5.5.4). Such crazy men unnecessarily waste time, energy and money in attempting to defy the glorious activities of Urukrama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

### Purport

There are three kinds of ceremonies — specifically, ceremonies to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the demigods, those performed for social celebrations like marriages and birthdays, and those meant to please the forefathers, like the *śrāddha* ceremony. In all these ceremonies, large amounts of money are spent for various activities, but here it is suggested that if along with this there is recitation of the wonderful activities of Vāmanadeva, certainly the ceremony will be carried out successfully and will be free of all discrepancies.
