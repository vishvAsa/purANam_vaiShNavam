CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

This chapter describes how Lord Vāmanadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of Mahārāja Bali, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.

Lord Vāmanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus. His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments. Lord Viṣṇu appeared at an auspicious moment on Śravaṇa-dvādaśī when the Abhijit star had arisen. At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the *brāhmaṇas* and even the seasons were happy because of God’s appearance. Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijayā. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a *sac-cid-ānanda* body, appeared as the son of Kaśyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished. After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vāmana). All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Kaśyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vāmana. At the time of Lord Vāmanadeva’s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Bṛhaspati, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahmā, Kuvera, the seven *ṛṣis* and others. Lord Vāmanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the Narmadā River, at the field known as Bhṛgukaccha, where *brāhmaṇas* of the Bhṛgu dynasty were performing *yajñas.* Wearing a belt made of *muñja* straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a *daṇḍa,* an umbrella and a waterpot (*kamaṇḍalu*), Lord Vāmanadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mahārāja Bali. Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord Vāmanadeva. Even Lord Śiva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord Vāmanadeva. Therefore, after washing the Lord’s feet, Bali Mahārāja immediately accepted the water from the Lord’s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then Bali Mahārāja inquired of Lord Vāmanadeva’s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.

prādurbabhūvāmṛta-bhūr adityām  
catur-bhujaḥ śaṅkha-gadābja-cakraḥ  
piśaṅga-vāsā nalināyatekṣaṇaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *ittham* — in this way; *viriñca*-*stuta*-*karma*-*vīryaḥ* — the Personality of Godhead, whose activities and prowess are always praised by Lord Brahmā; *prādurbabhūva* — became manifested; *amṛta*-*bhūḥ* — whose appearance is always deathless; *adityām* — from the womb of Aditi; *catuḥ*-*bhujaḥ* — having four arms; *śaṅkha*-*gadā*-*abja*-*cakraḥ* — decorated with conchshell, club, lotus and disc; *piśaṅga*-*vāsāḥ* — dressed in yellow garments; *nalina*-*āyata*-*īkṣaṇaḥ* — having blooming eyes like the petals of a lotus.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: After Lord Brahmā had thus spoken, glorifying the Supreme Lord’s activities and prowess, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never subject to death like an ordinary living being, appeared from the womb of Aditi. His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.**

### Purport

The word *amṛta-bhūḥ* is significant in this verse. The Lord sometimes appears like an ordinary child taking birth, but this does not mean that He is subject to birth, death or old age. One must be very intelligent to understand the appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord in His incarnations. This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ.* One should try to understand that the Lord’s appearance and disappearance and His activities are all *divyam,* or transcendental. The Lord has nothing to do with material activities. One who understands the appearance, disappearance and activities of the Lord is immediately liberated. After giving up his body, he never again has to accept a material body, but is transferred to the spiritual world (*tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*).

The demigods, the cows, the brāhmaṇas and the hills and mountains were all filled with joy.**

muhūrte ’bhijiti prabhuḥ  
sarve nakṣatra-tārādyāś  
cakrus taj-janma dakṣiṇam*

### Synonyms

*śroṇāyām* — when the moon was situated in the Śravaṇa lunar mansion; *śravaṇa*-*dvādaśyām* — on the twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhādra, the day famous as the Śravaṇa-dvādaśī; *muhūrte* — in the auspicious moment; *abhijiti* — in the first portion of the Śravaṇa lunar mansion known as the Abhijit-nakṣatra and in the Abhijit-muhūrta (occurring at midday); *prabhuḥ* — the Lord; *sarve* — all; *nakṣatra* — stars; *tārā* — planets; *ādyāḥ* — beginning with the sun and followed by the other planets; *cakruḥ* — made; *tat*-*janma* — the birthday of the Lord; *dakṣiṇam* — very munificent.

### Translation

**On the day of Śravaṇa-dvādaśī \[the twelfth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhādra\], when the moon came into the lunar mansion Śravaṇa, at the auspicious moment of Abhijit, the Lord appeared in this universe. Considering the Lord’s appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planets, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, an expert astrologer, explains the word *nakṣatra-tārādyāḥ.* The word *nakṣatra* means “the stars,” the word *tāra* in this context refers to the planets, and *ādyāḥ* means “the first one specifically mentioned.” Among the planets, the first is Sūrya, the sun, not the moon. Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer’s proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted. The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week — Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday — corresponds to the Vedic order of the planets and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version. Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planets and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord.

### Synonyms

*yat* — which; *tat* — that; *vapuḥ* — transcendental body; *bhāti* — manifests; *vibhūṣaṇa* — with regular ornaments; *āyudhaiḥ* — and with weapons; *avyakta* — unmanifested; *cit*-*vyaktam* — spiritually manifested; *adhārayat* — assumed; *hariḥ* — the Lord; *babhūva* — immediately became; *tena* — with that; *eva* — certainly; *saḥ* — He (the Lord); *vāmanaḥ* — dwarf; *vaṭuḥ* — a *brāhmaṇa brahmacārī*; *sampaśyatoḥ* — while both His father and mother were seeing; *divya*-*gatiḥ* — whose movements are wonderful; *yathā* — as; *naṭaḥ* — a theatrical actor.

### Translation

**The Lord appeared in His original form, with ornaments and weapons in His hands. Although this ever-existing form is not visible in the material world, He nonetheless appeared in this form. Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of Vāmana, a brāhmaṇa-dwarf, a brahmacārī, just like a theatrical actor.**

### Purport

The word *naṭaḥ* is significant. An actor changes dress to play different parts, but is always the same man. Similarly, as described in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.33, 39), the Lord assumes many thousands and millions of forms (*advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam*). He is always present with innumerable incarnations (*rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu*). Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another. He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms. When Vāmanadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of Nārāyaṇa, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a *brahmacārī* (*vaṭu*). This means that His body is not material. One who thinks that the Supreme Lord assumes a material body is not intelligent. He has to learn more about the Lord’s position. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9), *janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ.* One has to understand the transcendental appearance of the Lord in His original transcendental body (*sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha*).

**When the great sages saw the Lord as the brahmacārī-dwarf Vāmana, they were certainly very pleased. Thus they placed before them Kaśyapa Muni, the Prajāpati, and performed all the ritualistic ceremonies, such as the birthday ceremony.**

### Purport

According to Vedic civilization, when a child is born in the family of a *brāhmaṇa,* the birthday ceremony, known as *jāta-karma,* is first performed, and then other ceremonies are also gradually performed. But when this *vāmana-rūpa* appeared in the form of a *vaṭu,* or *brahmacārī,* His sacred thread ceremony was also performed immediately.

Thus although the Lord was going to Bali Mahārāja to beg something, He is always complete and has nothing to beg from anyone. Indeed, He is so powerful that in His full opulence He pressed down the surface of the earth at every step.

Being aware of religious principles, Bali Mahārāja knew this. Consequently, following in the footsteps of Lord Śiva, he also placed on his head the water that had washed the Lord’s lotus feet.**

### Purport

Lord Śiva is known as Gaṅgā-dhara, or one who carries the water of the Ganges on his head. On Lord Śiva’s forehead is the emblem of the half-moon, yet to give supreme respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śiva placed the water of the Ganges above this emblem. This example should be followed by everyone, or at least by every devotee, because Lord Śiva is one of the *mahājanas.* Similarly, Mahārāja Bali also later became a *mahājana.* One *mahājana* follows another *mahājana,* and by following the *paramparā* system of *mahājana* activities one can become advanced in spiritual consciousness. The water of the Ganges is sanctified because it emanates from the toe of Lord Viṣṇu. Bali Mahārāja washed the lotus feet of Vāmanadeva, and the water with which he did so became equal to the Ganges. Bali Mahārāja, who perfectly knew all religious principles, therefore took that water on his head, following in the footsteps of Lord Śiva.
