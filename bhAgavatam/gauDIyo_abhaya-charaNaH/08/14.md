CHAPTER FOURTEEN

This chapter describes the duties allotted to Manu by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All the Manus, as well as their sons, the sages, the demigods and the Indras, act under the orders of various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the end of every *catur-yuga,* consisting of Satya-yuga, Dvāpara-yuga, Tretā-yuga and Kali-yuga, the sages, acting under the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, distribute the Vedic knowledge and thus reinstate eternal religious principles. Manu’s duty is to reestablish the system of religion. Manu’s sons execute Manu’s orders, and thus the entire universe is maintained by Manu and his descendants. The Indras are various rulers of the heavenly planets. Assisted by the demigods, they rule the three worlds. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also appears as incarnations in different *yugas.* He appears as Sanaka, Sanātana, Yājñavalkya, Dattātreya and others, and thus He gives instructions in spiritual knowledge, prescribed duties, principles of mystic *yoga,* and so on. As Marīci and others, He creates progeny; as the king, He punishes the miscreants; and in the form of time, He annihilates the creation. One may argue, “If the all-powerful Supreme Personality of Godhead can do anything simply by His will, why has He arranged for so many personalities to manage?” How and why He does this cannot be understood by those who are under the clutches of *māyā.*

चतुर्युगान्ते कालेन ग्रस्ताञ्छ्रुतिगणान्यथा ।  
तपसा ऋषयोऽपश्यन्यतो धर्म- सनातन- ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*catur-yugānte kālena  
grastāñ chruti-gaṇān yathā  
tapasā ṛṣayo ’paśyan  
yato dharmaḥ sanātanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*catuḥ*-*yuga*-*ante* — at the end of every four *yugas* (Satya, Dvāpara, Tretā and Kali); *kālena* — in due course of time; *grastān* — lost; *śruti*-*gaṇān* — the Vedic instruction; *yathā* — as; *tapasā* — by austerity; *ṛṣayaḥ* — great saintly persons; *apaśyan* — by seeing misuse; *yataḥ* — wherefrom; *dharmaḥ* — occupational duties; *sanātanaḥ* — eternal.

### Translation

**At the end of every four yugas, the great saintly persons, upon seeing that the eternal occupational duties of mankind have been misused, reestablish the principles of religion.**

### Purport

In this verse, the words *dharmaḥ* and *sanātanaḥ* are very important. *Sanātana* means “eternal,” and *dharma* means “occupational duties.” From Satya-yuga to Kali-yuga, the principles of religion and occupational duty gradually deteriorate. In Satya-yuga, the religious principles are observed in full, without deviation. In Tretā-yuga, however, these principles are somewhat neglected, and only three fourths of the religious duties continue. In Dvāpara-yuga only half of the religious principles continue, and in Kali-yuga only one fourth of the religious principles, which gradually disappear. At the end of Kali-yuga, the principles of religion, or the occupational duties of humanity, are almost lost. Indeed, in this Kali-yuga we have passed through only five thousand years, yet the decline of *sanātana-dharma* is very prominent. The duty of saintly persons, therefore, is to take up seriously the cause of *sanātana-dharma* and try to reestablish it for the benefit of the entire human society. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has been started according to this principle. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51):

*kaler doṣa-nidhe rājan  
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ  
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya  
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet*

The entire Kali-yuga is full of faults. It is like an unlimited ocean of faults. But the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very authorized. Therefore, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who five hundred years ago inaugurated the movement of *saṅkīrtana, kṛṣṇa-kīrtana,* we are trying to introduce this movement, according to superior orders, all over the world. Now, if the inaugurators of this movement strictly follow the regulative principles and spread this movement for the benefit of all human society, they will certainly usher in a new way of life by reestablishing *sanātana-dharma,* the eternal occupational duties of humanity. The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Kṛṣṇa. *Jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya-kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa.’* This is the purport of *sanātana-dharma.* *Sanātana* means *nitya,* or “eternal,” and *kṛṣṇa-dāsa* means “servant of Kṛṣṇa.” The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is the sum and substance of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

ततो धर्मं चतुष्पादं मनवो हरिणोदिता- ।  
युक्ता- सञ्चारयन्त्यद्धा स्वे स्वे काले महीं नृप ॥ ५ ॥

### Verse text

*tato dharmaṁ catuṣpādaṁ  
manavo hariṇoditāḥ  
yuktāḥ sañcārayanty addhā  
sve sve kāle mahīṁ nṛpa*

### Synonyms

*tataḥ* — thereafter (at the end of Kali-yuga); *dharmam* — the religious principle; *catuḥ*-*pādam* — in four parts; *manavaḥ* — all the Manus; *hariṇā* — by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *uditāḥ* — being instructed; *yuktāḥ* — being engaged; *sañcārayanti* — reestablish; *addhā* — directly; *sve* *sve* — in their own; *kāle* — time; *mahīm* — within this world; *nṛpa* — O King.

### Translation

**Thereafter, O King, the Manus, being fully engaged according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, directly reestablish the principles of occupational duty in its full four parts.**

### Purport

*Dharma,* or occupational duty, can be established in its full four parts as explained in *Bhagavad-gītā.* In *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.1) the Lord says:

*imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ  
proktavān aham avyayam  
vivasvān manave prāha  
manur ikṣvākave ’bravīt*

“I instructed this imperishable science of *yoga* to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku.” This is the process of disciplic succession. Following the same process, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching the principles of *Bhagavad-gītā* as it is, without deviation, all over the world. If the fortunate people of this time accept the instructions of Lord Kṛṣṇa, they will certainly be happy in Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mission. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted everyone, at least in India, to become a preacher of this mission. In other words, one should become a *guru* and preach the Lord’s instructions all over the world for the peace and prosperity of humanity.

पालयन्ति प्रजापाला यावदन्तं विभागश- ।  
यज्ञभागभुजो देवा ये च तत्रान्विताश्च तै- ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*pālayanti prajā-pālā  
yāvad antaṁ vibhāgaśaḥ  
yajña-bhāga-bhujo devā  
ye ca tatrānvitāś ca taiḥ*

### Synonyms

*pālayanti* — execute the order; *prajā*-*pālāḥ* — the rulers of the world, namely the sons and grandsons of Manu; *yāvat* *antam* — unto the end of Manu’s reign; *vibhāgaśaḥ* — in divisions; *yajña*-*bhāga*-*bhujaḥ* — the enjoyers of the result of *yajñas*; *devāḥ* — the demigods; *ye* — others; *ca* — also; *tatra* *anvitāḥ* — engaged in that business; *ca* — also; *taiḥ* — by them.

### Translation

**To enjoy the results of sacrifices \[yajñas\], the rulers of the world, namely the sons and grandsons of Manu, discharge the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead until the end of Manu’s reign. The demigods also share the results of these sacrifices.**

### Purport

As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.2):

*evaṁ paramparā-prāptam  
imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ*

“This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.” This *paramparā* system extends from Manu to Ikṣvāku and from Ikṣvāku to his sons and grandsons. The rulers of the world in the line of hierarchy execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the *paramparā* system. Anyone interested in peaceful life must participate in this *paramparā* system and perform *yajñas.* As Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas in the *paramparā* system of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we must perform *saṅkīrtana-yajña* all over the world (*yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ*). Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this Age of Kali, and He will be easily satisfied if the *saṅkīrtana* movement is spread vigorously all over the world. This will also make people happy without a doubt.

ज्ञानं चानुयुगं ब्रूते हरि- सिद्धस्वरूपधृक् ।  
ऋषिरूपधर- कर्म योगं योगेशरूपधृक् ॥ ८ ॥

### Verse text

*jñānaṁ cānuyugaṁ brūte  
hariḥ siddha-svarūpa-dhṛk  
ṛṣi-rūpa-dharaḥ karma  
yogaṁ yogeśa-rūpa-dhṛk*

### Synonyms

*jñānam* — transcendental knowledge; *ca* — and; *anuyugam* — according to the age; *brūte* — explains; *hariḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *siddha*-*svarūpa*-*dhṛk* — assuming the form of liberated persons like Sanaka and Sanātana; *ṛṣi*-*rūpa*-*dharaḥ* — assuming the form of great saintly persons like Yājñavalkya; *karma* — *karma*; *yogam* — the mystic *yoga* system; *yoga*-*īśa*-*rūpa*-*dhṛk* — by assuming the form of a great *yogī* like Dattātreya.

### Translation

**In every yuga, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, assumes the form of Siddhas such as Sanaka to preach transcendental knowledge, He assumes the form of great saintly persons such as Yājñavalkya to teach the way of karma, and He assumes the form of great yogīs such as Dattātreya to teach the system of mystic yoga.**

### Purport

For the benefit of all human society, not only does the Lord assume the form of Manu as an incarnation to rule the universe properly, but He also assumes the forms of a teacher, *yogī, jñānī* and so on, for the benefit of human society. The duty of human society, therefore, is to accept the path of action enunciated by the Supreme Lord. In the present age, the sum and substance of all Vedic knowledge is to be found in *Bhagavad-gītā,* which is personally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the same Supreme Godhead, assuming the form of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, expands the teachings of *Bhagavad-gītā* all over the world. In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is so kind and merciful to human society that He is always anxious to take the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead.

### Translation

**In the form of Prajāpati Marīci, the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates progeny; becoming the king, He kills the thieves and rogues; and in the form of time, He annihilates everything.

### Translation

**People in general are bewildered by the illusory energy, and therefore they try to find the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through various types of research and philosophical speculation. Nonetheless, they are unable to see the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

Whatever actions and reactions take place for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world are actually brought about by the one Supreme Person. There are many varieties of philosophers trying to search for the ultimate cause under different names and forms, but they are unable to find the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who explains in *Bhagavad-gītā* that He is the origin of everything and the cause of all causes (*ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ*). This inability is due to the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord. Devotees, therefore, accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is and remain happy simply by chanting the glories of the Lord.
