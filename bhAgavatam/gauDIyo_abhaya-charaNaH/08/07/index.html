  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER SEVEN
The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced kālakūṭa poison. Everyone feared this poison, but Lord Śiva satisfied them by drinking it.
With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vāsuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The prajāpatis, seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord Śiva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord Śiva is called Āśutoṣa because he is very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning. The goddess Durgā, Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Śiva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Śiva’s prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement. Then Lord Śiva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.">

  <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
<p>The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced <em>kālakūṭa</em> poison. Everyone feared this poison, but Lord Śiva satisfied them by drinking it.</p>
<p>With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vāsuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The <em>prajāpatis,</em> seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord Śiva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord Śiva is called Āśutoṣa because he is very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning. The goddess Durgā, Bhavānī, the wife of Lord Śiva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Śiva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Śiva’s prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement. Then Lord Śiva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.</p>

<h3 id="translation-2">Translation</h3>
<p><strong>The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake. Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious. Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purport">Purport</h3>
<p>The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous. Moreover, Daityas must always do the opposite of the demigods. That is their nature. We have actually seen this in relation to our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words <em>svādhyāya-śruta-sampannāḥ.</em> They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious. This difference of opinion will always continue. Indeed, it has existed since days of yore. Millions of years ago, there was the same competition. The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth. The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth. If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, “Why should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it?”</p>
<p>In regard to the words <em>svādhyāya-śruta-sampannāḥ prakhyātā janma-karmabhiḥ,</em> another question may be raised. If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon. There are many examples in history of men like Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa and Kaṁsa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called Rākṣasas, or demons. One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon. That is described by the Lord Himself in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (7.15):</p>
<p><em>na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br>
prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br>
māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br>
āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ</em></p>
<p>“Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.” <em>Āsuraṁ bhāvam</em> refers to not accepting the existence of God or the transcendental instructions of the Personality of Godhead. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> clearly consists of transcendental instructions imparted directly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But <em>asuras,</em> instead of accepting these instructions directly, make commentaries according to their own whimsical ways and mislead everyone, without profit even for themselves. One should therefore be very careful of demoniac, godless persons. According to the words of Lord Kṛṣṇa, even if a godless demon is very well educated, he must be considered a <em>mūḍha, narādhama</em> and <em>māyayāpahṛta jñāna.</em></p>

<p>Here is evidence that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller of everything. As we have previously described, there are two classes of men — the demons and the demigods — but neither of them are supremely powerful. Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power. The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler. When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord. <em>Tat te ’nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam.</em> Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions. Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental. Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally. It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed. The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain. <em>Kṣitir iha vipulatare tava tiṣṭhati pṛṣṭhe.</em> The Lord held the great mountain on His back. <em>Keśava dhṛta-kūrma-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</em> Dangers can be created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they can also be removed by Him. This is known to devotees, but demons cannot understand it.</p>

<p>One may question that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead was personally present, why did He accompany all the demigods and people in general to take shelter of Lord Sadāśiva instead of intervening Himself. In this connection Śrīla Madhvācārya warns:</p>

<p>Since Lord Śiva is in charge of annihilation, why should he be approached for protection, which is given by Lord Viṣṇu? Lord Brahmā creates, and Lord Śiva annihilates, but both Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are incarnations of Lord Viṣṇu and are known as <em>śaktyāveśa-avatāras.</em> They are endowed with a special power like that of Lord Viṣṇu, who is actually all-pervading in their activities. Therefore whenever prayers for protection are offered to Lord Śiva, actually Lord Viṣṇu is indicated, for otherwise Lord Śiva is meant for destruction. Lord Śiva is one of the <em>īśvaras,</em> or the controllers known as <em>śaktyāveśa-avatāras.</em> Therefore he can be addressed as having the qualities of Lord Viṣṇu.</p>

<p>Actually Lord Viṣṇu maintains and accomplishes all good fortune. If one has to take shelter of Lord Viṣṇu, why should the demigods take shelter of Lord Śiva? They did so because Lord Viṣṇu acts through Lord Śiva in the creation of the material world. Lord Śiva acts on behalf of Lord Viṣṇu. When the Lord says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (14.4) that He is the father of all living entities (<em>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</em>), this refers to actions performed by Lord Viṣṇu through Lord Śiva. Lord Viṣṇu is always unattached to material activities, and when material activities are to be performed, Lord Viṣṇu performs them through Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is therefore worshiped on the level of Lord Viṣṇu. When Lord Viṣṇu is untouched by the external energy He is Lord Viṣṇu, but when He is in touch with the external energy, He appears in His feature as Lord Śiva.</p>

<p>The <em>brahmajyoti</em> is actually the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in <em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> (5.40):</p>

<p>“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.” Although the impersonal feature of the Absolute is an expansion of the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He does not need to take care of the impersonalists who enter the <em>brahmajyoti.</em> Kṛṣṇa says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (9.4), <em>mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:</em> “In My impersonal feature I pervade this entire universe.” Thus the <em>avyakta-mūrti,</em> the impersonal feature, is certainly an expansion of Kṛṣṇa’s energy. Māyāvādīs, who prefer to merge into this Brahman effulgence, worship Lord Śiva. The <em>mantras</em> referred to in text 29 are called <em>mukhāni pañcopaniṣadas taveśa.</em> Māyāvādīs take all these <em>mantras</em> seriously in worshiping Lord Śiva. These <em>mantras</em> are as follows: (1) <em>tat puruṣāya vidmahe śāntyai,</em> (2) <em>mahā-devāya dhīmahi vidyāyai,</em> (3) <em>tan no rudraḥ pratiṣṭhāyai,</em> (4) <em>pracodayāt dhṛtyai,</em> (5) <em>aghorebhyas tamā … ,</em> (6) <em>atha ghorebhyo mohā … ,</em> (7) <em>aghorebhyo rakṣā … ,</em> (8) <em>aghoratarebhyo nidrā … ,</em> (9) <em>sarvebhyaḥ sarva-vyādhyai,</em> (10) <em>sarva-sarvebhyo mṛtyave,</em> (11) <em>namas te ’stu kṣudhā … ,</em> (12) <em>rudra-rūpebhyas tṛṣṇā … ,</em> (13) <em>vāmadevāya rajā … ,</em> (14) <em>jyeṣṭhāya svāhā … ,</em> (15) <em>śreṣṭhāya ratyai,</em> (16) <em>rudrāya kalyāṇyai,</em> (17) <em>kālāya kāmā … ,</em> (18) <em>kala-vikaraṇāya sandhinyai,</em> (19) <em>bala-vikaraṇāya kriyā … ,</em> (20) <em>balāya vṛddhyai,</em> (21) <em>balacchāyā … ,</em> (22) <em>pramathanāya dhātryai,</em> (23) <em>sarva-bhūta-damanāya bhrāmaṇyai,</em> (24) <em>manaḥ-śoṣiṇyai,</em> (25) <em>unmanāya jvarā … ,</em> (26) <em>sadyojātaṁ prapadyāmi siddhyai,</em> (27) <em>sadyojātāya vai namaḥ ṛddhyai,</em> (28) <em>bhave dityai,</em> (29) <em>abhave lakṣmyai,</em> (30) <em>nātibhave medhā … ,</em> (31) <em>bhajasva māṁ kāntyai,</em> (32) <em>bhava svadhā … ,</em> (33) <em>udbhavāya prabhā … ,</em> (34) <em>īśānaḥ sarva-vidyānāṁ śaśinyai,</em> (35) <em>īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām abhaya-dā … ,</em> (36) <em>brahmādhipatir brahmaṇodhipatir brahman brahmeṣṭa-dā … ,</em> (37) <em>śivo me astu marīcyai,</em> (38) <em>sadāśivaḥ jvālinyai.</em></p>
<p>The impersonal Brahman is unknown even to the other directors of the material creation, including Lord Brahmā, Lord Indra and even Lord Viṣṇu. This does not mean, however, that Lord Viṣṇu is not omniscient. Lord Viṣṇu is omniscient, but He does not need to understand what is going on in His all-pervading expansion. Therefore in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> the Lord says that although everything is an expansion of Him (<em>mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam</em>), He does not need to take care of everything (<em>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ</em>), since there are various directors like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and Indra.</p>

<p><strong>It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s heart.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purport-18">Purport</h3>
<p>Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (18.68-69), <em>ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati … na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ:</em> “One who preaches the message of <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship.” There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of <em>karma</em> cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of <em>karma,</em> that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to <em>karma</em> and it reactions. No one can change this. Therefore the <em>śāstra</em> says:</p>
<p><em>tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br>
na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ</em></p>
<p>(<em>Bhāg.</em> 1.5.18)</p>
<p>One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of <em>karma.</em> What is that? One should endeavor to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If one tries to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (<em>teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham</em>). Again, as stated here, <em>tapyante loka-tāpena sādhavaḥ prāyaśo janāḥ.</em> The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity.</p>
<p><em>yadā yadā hi dharmasya<br>
glānir bhavati bhārata<br>
abhyutthānam adharmasya<br>
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham</em></p>
<p><em>paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ<br>
vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām<br>
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya<br>
sambhavāmi yuge yuge</em></p>
<p>“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.” (Bg. 4.7-8) All the <em>śāstras</em> conclude, therefore, that spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world. Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee.</p>
