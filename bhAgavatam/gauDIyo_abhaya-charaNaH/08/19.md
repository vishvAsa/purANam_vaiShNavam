CHAPTER NINETEEN

This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Lord Vāmanadeva asked for three paces of land in charity, how Bali Mahārāja agreed to His proposal, and how Śukrācārya forbade Bali Mahārāja to fulfill Lord Vāmanadeva’s request.

When Bali Mahārāja, thinking Vāmanadeva to be the son of a *brāhmaṇa,* told Him to ask for anything He liked, Lord Vāmanadeva praised Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa for their heroic activities, and after thus praising the family in which Bali Mahārāja had been born, He begged the King for three paces of land. Bali Mahārāja agreed to give this land in charity, since this was very insignificant, but Śukrācārya, who could understand that Vāmanadeva was Viṣṇu, the friend of the demigods, forbade Bali Mahārāja to give this land. Śukrācārya advised Bali Mahārāja to withdraw his promise. He explained that in subduing others, in joking, in responding to danger, in acting for the welfare of others, and so on, one could refuse to fulfill one’s promise, and there would be no fault. By this philosophy, Śukrācārya tried to dissuade Bali Mahārāja from giving land to Lord Vāmanadeva.

*iti vairocaner vākyaṁ  
dharma-yuktaṁ sa sūnṛtam  
niśamya bhagavān prītaḥ

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *iti* — thus; *vairocaneḥ* — of the son of Virocana; *vākyam* — the words; *dharma*-*yuktam* — in terms of religious principles; *saḥ* — He; *sū*-*nṛtam* — very pleasing; *niśamya* — hearing; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *prītaḥ* — completely pleased; *pratinandya* — congratulating him; *idam* — the following words; *abravīt* — said.

kulocitaṁ dharma-yutaṁ yaśas-karam  
yasya pramāṇaṁ bhṛgavaḥ sāmparāye  
pitāmahaḥ kula-vṛddhaḥ praśāntaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *vacaḥ* — words; *tava* — your; *etat* — this kind of; *jana*-*deva* — O King of the people; *sū*-*nṛtam* — very true; *kula*-*ucitam* — exactly befitting your dynasty; *dharma*-*yutam* — completely in accord with the principles of religion; *yaśaḥ*-*karam* — fit for spreading your reputation; *yasya* — of whom; *pramāṇam* — the evidence; *bhṛgavaḥ* — the *brāhmaṇas* of the Bhṛgu dynasty; *sāmparāye* — in the next world; *pitāmahaḥ* — your grandfather; *kula*-*vṛddhaḥ* — the oldest in the family; *praśāntaḥ* — very peaceful (Prahlāda Mahārāja).

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O King, you are indeed exalted because your present advisors are the brāhmaṇas who are descendants of Bhṛgu and because your instructor for your future life is your grandfather, the peaceful and venerable Prahlāda Mahārāja. Your statements are very true, and they completely agree with religious etiquette. They are in keeping with the behavior of your family, and they enhance your reputation.**

### Purport

Prahlāda Mahārāja is a vivid example of a pure devotee. Someone might argue that since Prahlāda Mahārāja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Mahārāja, how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word *praśāntaḥ.* A devotee is always sober. He is never disturbed by any conditions. Even if a devotee remains in *gṛhastha* life and does not renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be *praśānta,* sober, because of his pure devotion to the Lord. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said:

*kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya  
yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei ‘guru’ haya*

“Whether one is a *brāhmaṇa,* a *sannyāsī* or a *śūdra* — regardless of what he is — he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Kṛṣṇa.” (Cc. *Madhya* 8.128) Anyone completely aware of the science of Kṛṣṇa, regardless of his status in life, is a *guru.* Thus Prahlāda Mahārāja is a *guru* in all circumstances.

Here His Lordship Vāmanadeva also teaches *sannyāsīs* and *brahmacārīs* that one should not ask more than necessary. He wanted only three paces of land, although Bali Mahārāja wanted to give Him anything He wanted.

parāṅmukhā ye tv amanasvino nṛpa  
yuṣmat-kule yad yaśasāmalena

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *santi* — there are; *tīrthe* — in holy places (where charity is given); *yudhi* — in the battlefield; *ca* — also; *arthinā* — by a *brāhmaṇa* or a *kṣatriya*; *arthitāḥ* — who have been asked; *parāṅmukhāḥ* — who refused their prayers; *ye* — such persons; *tu* — indeed; *amanasvinaḥ* — such low-minded, low-grade kings; *nṛpa* — O King (Bali Mahārāja); *yuṣmat*-*kule* — in your dynasty; *yat* — therein; *yaśasā* *amalena* — by impeccable reputation; *prahrādaḥ* — Prahlāda Mahārāja; *udbhāti* — arises; *yathā* — as; *uḍupaḥ* — the moon; *khe* — in the sky.

### Translation

**O King Bali, never in your dynasty has the low-minded king been born who upon being requested has refused charity to brāhmaṇas in holy places or a fight to kṣatriyas on a battlefield. And your dynasty is even more glorious due to the presence of Prahlāda Mahārāja, who is like the beautiful moon in the sky.**

### Purport

The symptoms of a *kṣatriya* are given in *Bhagavad-gītā.* One of the qualifications is the willingness to give charity (*dāna*). A *kṣatriya* does not refuse to give charity when requested by a *brāhmaṇa,* nor can he refuse to fight another *kṣatriya.* A king who does refuse is called low-minded. In the dynasty of Bali Mahārāja there were no such low-minded kings.

### Translation

*evaṁ sa niścitya ripoḥ śarīram  
ādhāvato nirviviśe ’surendra  
śvāsānilāntarhita-sūkṣma-dehas  
tat-prāṇa-randhreṇa vivigna-cetāḥ*

### Synonyms

*evam* — in this way; *saḥ* — He (Lord Viṣṇu); *niścitya* — deciding; *ripoḥ* — of the enemy; *śarīram* — the body; *ādhāvataḥ* — who was running after Him with great force; *nirviviśe* — entered; *asura*-*indra* — O King of the demons (Mahārāja Bali); *śvāsa*-*anila* — through the breathing; *antarhita* — invisible; *sūkṣma*-*dehaḥ* — in his finer body; *tat*-*prāṇa*-*randhreṇa* — through the hole of the nostril; *vivigna*-*cetāḥ* — being very anxious.

### Translation

**Lord Vāmanadeva continued: O King of the demons, after Lord Viṣṇu made this decision, He entered the body of His enemy Hiraṇyakaśipu, who was running after Him with great force. In a subtle body inconceivable to Hiraṇyakaśipu, Lord Viṣṇu, who was in great anxiety, entered Hiraṇyakaśipu’s nostril along with his breath.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is already in the core of everyone’s heart. *īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati* (Bg. 18.61). Logically, therefore, it was not at all difficult for Lord Viṣṇu to enter Hiraṇyakaśipu’s body. The word *vivigna-cetāḥ,* “very anxious,” is significant. It is not that Lord Viṣṇu was afraid of Hiraṇyakaśipu; rather, because of compassion, Lord Viṣṇu was in anxiety about how to act for his welfare.

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — that Hiraṇyakaśipu; *tat*-*niketam* — the residence of Lord Viṣṇu; *parimṛśya* — searching; *śūnyam* — vacant; *apaśyamānaḥ* — not seeing Lord Viṣṇu; *kupitaḥ* — being very angry; *nanāda* — cried very loudly; *kṣmām* — on the surface of the earth; *dyām* — in outer space; *diśaḥ* — in all directions; *kham* — in the sky; *vivarān* — in all the caves; *samudrān* — all the oceans; *viṣṇum* — Lord Viṣṇu; *vicinvan* — searching for; *na* — not; *dadarśa* — did see; *vīraḥ* — although he was very powerful.

### Translation

**Upon seeing that the residence of Lord Viṣṇu was vacant, Hiraṇyakaśipu began searching for Lord Viṣṇu everywhere. Angry at not seeing Him, Hiraṇyakaśipu screamed loudly and searched the entire universe, including the surface of the earth, the higher planetary systems, all directions and all the caves and oceans. But Hiraṇyakaśipu, the greatest hero, did not see Viṣṇu anywhere.**

### Verse text

*apaśyann iti hovāca  
mayānviṣṭam idaṁ jagat  
bhrātṛ-hā me gato nūnaṁ  
yato nāvartate pumān*

### Synonyms

*apaśyan* — not seeing Him; *iti* — in this way; *ha* *uvāca* — uttered; *mayā* — by me; *anviṣṭam* — has been sought; *idam* — the whole; *jagat* — universe; *bhrātṛ*-*hā* — Lord Viṣṇu, who killed the brother; *me* — my; *gataḥ* — must have gone; *nūnam* — indeed; *yataḥ* — from where; *na* — not; *āvartate* — comes back; *pumān* — a person.

### Translation

**Unable to see Him, Hiraṇyakaśipu said, “I have searched the entire universe, but I could not find Viṣṇu, who has killed my brother. Therefore, He must certainly have gone to that place from which no one returns. \[In other words, He must now be dead.\]”**

### Purport

Atheists generally follow the Bauddha philosophical conclusion that at death everything is finished. Hiraṇyakaśipu, being an atheist, thought this way. Because Lord Viṣṇu was not visible to him, he thought that the Lord was dead. Even today, many people follow the philosophy that God is dead. But God is never dead. Even the living entity, who is part of God, never dies. *Na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit:* “For the soul there is never birth or death.” This is the statement of *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.20). Even the ordinary living entity never takes birth or dies. What then is to be said of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the chief of all living entities? He certainly never takes birth or dies. *Ajo ’pi sann avyayātmā* (Bg. 4.6). Both the Lord and the living entity exist as unborn and inexhaustible personalities. Thus Hiraṇyakaśipu’s conclusion that Viṣṇu was dead was wrong.

As indicated by the words *yato nāvartate pumān,* there is certainly a spiritual kingdom, and if the living entity goes there, he never returns to this material world. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9): *tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna.* Materially speaking, every living entity dies; death is inevitable. But those who are *karmīs, jñānīs* and *yogīs* return to this material world after death, whereas *bhaktas* do not. Of course, if a *bhakta* is not completely perfect he takes birth in the material world again, but in a very exalted position, either in a rich family or a family of the purest *brāhmaṇas* (*śucīnām śrīmatāṁ gehe*), just to finish his development in spiritual consciousness. Those who have completed the course of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are free from material desire return to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (*yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama*). Here the same fact is stated: *yato nāvartate pumān.* Any person who goes back home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material world.

### Synonyms

*vaira*-*anubandhaḥ* — enmity; *etāvān* — so great; *āmṛtyoḥ* — up to the point of death; *iha* — in this; *dehinām* — of persons too involved in the bodily concept of life; *ajñāna*-*prabhavaḥ* — because of the great influence of ignorance; *manyuḥ* — anger; *aham*-*māna* — by egotism; *upabṛṁhitaḥ* — expanded.

### Translation

**Hiraṇyakaśipu’s anger against Lord Viṣṇu persisted until his death. Other people in the bodily concept of life maintain anger only because of false ego and the great influence of ignorance.**

### Purport

Generally speaking, even though the conditioned soul is angry, his anger is not perpetual but temporary. It is due to the influence of ignorance. Hiraṇyakaśipu, however, maintained his enmity and his anger against Lord Viṣṇu until the point of death. He never forgot his vengeful attitude toward Viṣṇu for having killed his brother, Hiraṇyākṣa. Others in the bodily concept of life are angry at their enemies but not at Lord Viṣṇu. Hiraṇyakaśipu, however, was everlastingly angry. He was angry not only because of false prestige but also because of continuous enmity toward Viṣṇu.

### Translation

**Your father, Virocana, the son of Mahārāja Prahlāda, was very affectionate toward brāhmaṇas. Although he knew very well that it was the demigods who had come to him in the dress of brāhmaṇas, at their request he delivered to them the duration of his life.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Virocana, Bali’s father, was so pleased with the *brāhmaṇa* community that even though he knew that those approaching him for charity were the demigods in the dress of *brāhmaṇas,* he nonetheless agreed to give it.

### Translation

**O King of the Daityas, from Your Majesty, who come from such a noble family and who are able to give charity munificently, I ask only three paces of land, to the measurement of My steps.**

### Purport

Lord Vāmanadeva wanted three paces of land according to the measurement of His footsteps. He did not want more than necessary. But although He pretended to be an ordinary human child, He actually wanted the land comprising the upper, middle and lower planetary systems. This was just to show the prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*nānyat te kāmaye rājan

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *anyat* — anything else; *te* — from you; *kāmaye* — I beg; *rājan* — O King; *vadānyāt* — who are so munificent; *jagat*-*īśvarāt* — who are the king of the entire universe; *na* — not; *enaḥ* — distress; *prāpnoti* — gets; *vai* — indeed; *vidvān* — one who is learned; *yāvat*-*artha* — as much as one needs; *pratigrahaḥ* — taking charity from others.

### Translation

**O King, controller of the entire universe, although you are very munificent and are able to give Me as much land as I want, I do not want anything from you that is unnecessary. If a learned brāhmaṇa takes charity from others only according to his needs, he does not become entangled in sinful activities.**

### Purport

A *brāhmaṇa* or *sannyāsī* is qualified to ask charity from others, but if he takes more than necessary he is punishable. No one can use more of the Supreme Lord’s property than necessary. Lord Vāmanadeva indirectly indicated to Bali Mahārāja that he was occupying more land than he needed. In the material world, all distresses are due to extravagance. One acquires money extravagantly and also spends it extravagantly. Such activities are sinful. All property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all living beings, who are sons of the Supreme Lord, have the right to use the Supreme Father’s property, but one cannot take more than necessary. This principle should especially be followed by *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs* who live at the cost of others. Thus Vāmanadeva was an ideal beggar, for He asked only three paces of land. Of course, there is a difference between His footsteps and those of an ordinary human being. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His inconceivable prowess, can occupy the entire universe, including the upper, lower and middle planetary systems, by the unlimited measurement of His footsteps.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*baliḥ* *uvāca* — Bali Mahārāja said; *aho* — alas; *brāhmaṇa*-*dāyāda* — O son of a *brāhmaṇa*; *vācaḥ* — the words; *te* — of You; *vṛddha*-*sammatāḥ* — are certainly acceptable to learned and elderly persons; *tvam* — You; *bālaḥ* — a boy; *bāliśa*-*matiḥ* — without sufficient knowledge; *sva*-*artham* — self-interest; *prati* — toward; *abudhaḥ* — not knowing sufficiently; *yathā* — as it should have been.

### Translation

**Bali Mahārāja said: O son of a brāhmaṇa, Your instructions are as good as those of learned and elderly persons. Nonetheless, You are a boy, and Your intelligence is insufficient. Thus You are not very prudent in regard to Your self-interest.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being full in Himself, actually has nothing to want for His self-interest. Lord Vāmanadeva, therefore, had not gone to Bali Mahārāja for His own self-interest. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29), *bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram.* The Lord is the proprietor of all planets, in both the material and spiritual worlds. Why should He be in want of land? Bali Mahārāja rightly said that Lord Vāmanadeva was not at all prudent in regard to His own personal interests. Lord Vāmanadeva had approached Bali not for His personal welfare but for the welfare of His devotees. Devotees sacrifice all personal interests to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and similarly the Supreme Lord, although having no personal interests, can do anything for the interests of His devotees. One who is full in himself has no personal interests.

### Translation

**I am able to give You an entire island because I am the proprietor of the three divisions of the universe. You have come to take something from me and have pleased me by Your sweet words, but You are asking only three paces of land. Therefore You are not very intelligent.**

### Purport

According to Vedic understanding, the entire universe is regarded as an ocean of space. In that ocean there are innumerable planets, and each planet is called a *dvīpa,* or island. When approached by Lord Vāmanadeva, Bali Mahārāja was actually in possession of all the *dvīpas,* or islands in space. Bali Mahārāja was very pleased to see the features of Vāmanadeva and was ready to give Him as much land as He could ask, but because Lord Vāmanadeva asked only three paces of land, Bali Mahārāja considered Him not very intelligent.

### Translation

**The Personality of Godhead said: O my dear King, even the entirety of whatever there may be within the three worlds to satisfy one’s senses cannot satisfy a person whose senses are uncontrolled.**

### Purport

The material world is an illusory energy to deviate the living entities from the path of self-realization. Anyone who is in this material world is extremely anxious to get more and more things for sense gratification. Actually, however, the purpose of life is not sense gratification but self-realization. Therefore, those who are too addicted to sense gratification are advised to practice the mystic *yoga* system, or *aṣṭāṅga-yoga* system, consisting of *yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra* and so on. In this way, one can control the senses. The purpose of controlling the senses is to stop one’s implication in the cycle of birth and death. As stated by Ṛṣabhadeva:

*nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma  
yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti  
na sādhu manye yata ātmano ’yam  
asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ*

“When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.” (*Bhāg.* 5.5.4)

Thus according to Ṛṣabhadeva the human beings in this material world are just like madmen engaged in activities which they should not perform but which they do perform only for sense gratification. Such activities are not good because in this way one creates another body for his next life, as punishment for his nefarious activities. And as soon as he gets another material body, he is put into repeated suffering in material existence. Therefore the Vedic culture or brahminical culture teaches one how to be satisfied with possessing the minimum necessities in life.

To teach this highest culture, *varṇāśrama-dharma* is recommended. The aim of the *varṇāśrama* divisions — *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* — is to train one to control the senses and be content with the bare necessities. Here Lord Vāmanadeva, as an ideal *brahmacārī,* refuses Bali Mahārāja’s offer to give Him anything He might want. He says that without contentment one could not be happy even if he possessed the property of the entire world or the entire universe. In human society, therefore, the brahminical culture, *kṣatriya* culture and *vaiśya* culture must be maintained, and people must be taught how to be satisfied with only what they need. In modern civilization there is no such education; everyone tries to possess more and more, and everyone is dissatisfied and unhappy. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore establishing various farms, especially in America, to show how to be happy and content with minimum necessities of life and to save time for self-realization, which one can very easily achieve by chanting the *mahā-mantra* — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

### Translation

**One should be satisfied with whatever he achieves by his previous destiny, for discontent can never bring happiness. A person who is not self-controlled will not be happy even with possessing the three worlds.**

### Purport

If happiness is the ultimate goal of life, one must be satisfied with the position in which he is placed by providence. This instruction is also given by Prahlāda Mahārāja:

*sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā  
deha-yogena dehinām  
sarvatra labhyate daivād  
yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ*

“My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one’s past fruitive activities. Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress.” (*Bhāg.* 7.6.3) This philosophy is perfect in regard to obtaining happiness.

Real happiness is described in *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.21):

*sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad  
buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam  
vetti yatra na caivāyaṁ  
sthitaś calati tattvataḥ*

“In the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth.” One has to perceive happiness by the supersenses. The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements. Every one of us is a spiritual being (*ahaṁ brahmāsmi*), and every one of us is an individual person. Our senses are now covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to be our real senses. The real senses, however, are within the material covering. *Dehino ’smin yathā dehe:* within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses. *Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam:* when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy. Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: *hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.* When the senses are engaged in devotional service to Hṛṣīkeśa, then the senses are completely satisfied. Without this superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will never be possible. One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve satisfaction and contentment.

According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness. Then he will be happy. The purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to spread this understanding. People who do not have scientific spiritual knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are escapists trying to avoid material activities. In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate happiness in life. If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (5.5.1) therefore recommends:

*tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ  
śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam*

One must practice austerity so that his existential position will be purified and he will achieve unlimited blissful life.

**This person falsely appearing as a brahmacārī is actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who has come in this form to take away all your land, wealth, beauty, power, fame and education. After taking everything from you, He will deliver it to Indra, your enemy.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains in this regard that the very word *hariḥ* means “one who takes away.” If one connects himself with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord takes away all his miseries, and in the beginning the Lord also superficially appears to take away all his material possessions, reputation, education and beauty. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.88.8), *yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ.* The Lord said to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, “The first installment of My mercy toward a devotee is that I take away all his possessions, especially his material opulence, his money.” This is the special favor of the Lord toward a sincere devotee. If a sincere devotee wants Kṛṣṇa above everything but at the same time is attached to material possessions, which hinder his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by tactics the Lord takes away all his possessions. Here Śukrācārya says that this dwarf *brahmacārī* would take away everything. Thus he indicates that the Lord will take away all one’s material possessions and also one’s mind. If one delivers his mind to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa (*sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ*), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him. Although Bali Mahārāja was a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him, showed him special favor by appearing as Lord Vāmana to take away all his material possessions, and his mind as well.

### Purport

Bali Mahārāja might argue that he had promised only three steps of land. But Śukrācārya, being a very learned *brāhmaṇa,* immediately understood that this was a plan of Hari, who had falsely appeared there as a *brahmacārī.* The words *mūḍha vartiṣyase katham* reveal that Śukrācārya was a *brāhmaṇa* of the priestly class. Such priestly *brāhmaṇas* are mostly interested in receiving remuneration from their disciples. Therefore when Śukrācārya saw that Bali Mahārāja had risked all of his possessions, he understood that this would cause havoc not only to the King but also to the family of Śukrācārya, who was dependent on Mahārāja Bali’s mercy. This is the difference between a Vaiṣṇava and a *smārta-brāhmaṇa.* A *smārta-brāhmaṇa* is always interested in material profit, whereas a Vaiṣṇava is interested only in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. From the statement of Śukrācārya, it appears that he was in all respects a *smārta-brāhmaṇa* interested only in personal gain.

### Synonyms

*kramataḥ* — gradually; *gām* — the surface of the land; *padā* *ekena* — by one step; *dvitīyena* — by the second step; *divam* — the whole of outer space; *vibhoḥ* — of the universal form; *kham* *ca* — the sky also; *kāyena* — by the expansion of His transcendental body; *mahatā* — by the universal form; *tārtīyasya* — as far as the third step is concerned; *kutaḥ* — where is; *gatiḥ* — to keep His step.

### Translation

**Vāmanadeva will first occupy the three worlds with one step, then He will take His second step and occupy everything in outer space, and then He will expand His universal body to occupy everything. Where will you offer Him the third step?**

### Purport

Śukrācārya wanted to tell Bali Mahārāja how he would be cheated by Lord Vāmana. “You have promised three steps,” he said. “But with only two steps, all your possessions will be finished. How then will you give Him a place for His third step?” Śukrācārya did not know how the Lord protects His devotee. The devotee must risk everything in his possession for the service of the Lord, but he is always protected and never defeated. By materialistic calculations, Śukrācārya thought that Bali Mahārāja would under no circumstances be able to keep his promise to the *brahmacārī,* Lord Vāmanadeva.

### Translation

**Therefore one who is in full knowledge should divide his accumulated wealth in five parts — for religion, for reputation, for opulence, for sense gratification and for the maintenance of his family members. Such a person is happy in this world and in the next.**

### Purport

The *śāstras* enjoin that if one has money one should divide all that he has accumulated into five divisions — one part for religion, one part for reputation, one part for opulence, one part for sense gratification and one part to maintain the members of his family. At the present, however, because people are bereft of all knowledge, they spend all their money for the satisfaction of their family. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī taught us by his own example by using fifty percent of his accumulated wealth for Kṛṣṇa, twenty-five percent for his own self, and twenty-five percent for the members of his family. One’s main purpose should be to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This will include *dharma, artha* and *kāma.* However, because one’s family members expect some profit, one should also satisfy them by giving them a portion of one’s accumulated wealth. This is a śāstric injunction.

सत्यं पुष्पफलं विद्यादात्मवृक्षस्य गीयते ।

### Verse text

*satyaṁ puṣpa-phalaṁ vidyād  
ātma-vṛkṣasya gīyate  
vṛkṣe ’jīvati tan na syād  
anṛtaṁ mūlam ātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*satyam* — the factual truth; *puṣpa*-*phalam* — the flower and the fruit; *vidyāt* — one should understand; *ātma*-*vṛkṣasya* — of the tree of the body; *gīyate* — as described in the *Vedas*; *vṛkṣe* *ajīvati* — if the tree is not living; *tat* — that (*puṣpa-phalam*); *na* — not; *syāt* — is possible; *anṛtam* — untruth; *mūlam* — the root; *ātmanaḥ* — of the body.

### Translation

**The Vedas enjoin that the factual result of the tree of the body is the good fruits and flowers derived from it. But if the bodily tree does not exist, there is no possibility of factual fruits and flowers. Even if the body is based on untruth, there cannot be factual fruits and flowers without the help of the bodily tree.**

### Purport

This *śloka* explains that in relation to the material body even the factual truth cannot exist without a touch of untruth. The Māyāvādīs say, *brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā:* “The spirit soul is truth, and the external energy is untruth.” The Vaiṣṇava philosophers, however, do not agree with the Māyāvāda philosophy. Even if for the sake of argument the material world is accepted as untruth, the living entity entangled in the illusory energy cannot come out of it without the help of the body. Without the help of the body, one cannot follow a system of religion, nor can one speculate on philosophical perfection. Therefore, the flower and fruit (*puṣpa-phalam*) have to be obtained as a result of the body. Without the help of the body, that fruit cannot be gained. The Vaiṣṇava philosophy therefore recommends *yukta-vairāgya.* It is not that all attention should be diverted for the maintenance of the body, but at the same time one’s bodily maintenance should not be neglected. As long as the body exists one can thoroughly study the Vedic instructions, and thus at the end of life one can achieve perfection. This is explained in *Bhagavad-gītā:* *yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram.* Everything is examined at the time of death. Therefore, although the body is temporary, not eternal, one can take from it the best service and make one’s life perfect.

*tad yathā vṛkṣa unmūlaḥ  
śuṣyaty udvartate ’cirāt  
evaṁ naṣṭānṛtaḥ sadya  
ātmā śuṣyen na saṁśayaḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat* — therefore; *yathā* — as; *vṛkṣaḥ* — a tree; *unmūlaḥ* — being uprooted; *śuṣyati* — dries up; *udvartate* — falls down; *acirāt* — very soon; *evam* — in this way; *naṣṭa* — lost; *anṛtaḥ* — the temporary body; *sadyaḥ* — immediately; *ātmā* — the body; *śuṣyet* — dries up; *na* — not; *saṁśayaḥ* — any doubt.

### Translation

**When a tree is uprooted it immediately falls down and begins to dry up. Similarly, if one doesn’t take care of the body, which is supposed to be untruth — in other words, if the untruth is uprooted — the body undoubtedly becomes dry.**

### Purport

In this regard, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says:

*prāpañcikatayā buddhyā  
hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ  
mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo  
vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate*

“One who rejects things without knowledge of their relationship to Kṛṣṇa is incomplete in his renunciation.” (*Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* 1.2.66) When the body is engaged in the service of the Lord, one should not consider the body material. Sometimes the spiritual body of the spiritual master is misunderstood. But Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī instructs, *prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.* The body fully engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service should not be neglected as material. One who does neglect it is false in his renunciation. If the body is not properly maintained, it falls down and dries up like an uprooted tree, from which flowers and fruit can no longer be obtained. The *Vedas* therefore enjoin:

*om iti satyaṁ nety anṛtaṁ tad etat-puṣpaṁ phalaṁ vāco yat satyaṁ saheśvaro yaśasvī kalyāṇa-kīrtir bhavitā; puṣpaṁ hi phalaṁ vācaḥ satyaṁ vadaty athaitan-mūlaṁ vāco yad anṛtaṁ yad yathā vṛkṣa āvirmūlaḥ śuṣyati, sa udvartata evam evānṛtaṁ vadann āvirmūlam ātmanāṁ karoti, sa śuṣyati sa udvartate, tasmād anṛtaṁ na vaded dayeta tv etena.*

The purport is that activities performed with the help of the body for the satisfaction of the Absolute Truth (*oṁ tat sat*) are never temporary, although performed by the temporary body. Indeed, such activities are everlasting. Therefore, the body should be properly cared for. Because the body is temporary, not permanent, one cannot expose the body to being devoured by a tiger or killed by an enemy. All precautions should be taken to protect the body.

### Synonyms

*parāk* — that which separates; *riktam* — that which makes one free from attachment; *apūrṇam* — that which is insufficient; *vā* — either; *akṣaram* — this syllable; *yat* — that; *tat* — which; *om* — *oṁkāra*; *iti* — thus stated; *yat* — which; *kiñcit* — whatever; *om* — this word *om*; *iti* — thus; *brūyāt* — if you say; *tena* — by such an utterance; *ricyeta* — one becomes free; *vai* — indeed; *pumān* — a person; *bhikṣave* — unto a beggar; *sarvam* — everything; *oṁ* *kurvan* — giving charity by uttering the word *om*; *na* — not; *alam* — sufficiently; *kāmena* — for sense gratification; *ca* — also; *ātmane* — for self-realization.

### Translation

**The utterance of the word om signifies separation from one’s monetary assets. In other words, by uttering this word one becomes free from attachment to money because his money is taken away from him. To be without money is not very satisfactory, for in that position one cannot fulfill one’s desires. In other words, by using the word om one becomes poverty-stricken. Especially when one gives charity to a poor man or beggar, one remains unfulfilled in self-realization and in sense gratification.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Bali wanted to give everything to Vāmanadeva, who had appeared as a beggar, but Śukrācārya, being Mahārāja Bali’s familial spiritual master in the line of seminal succession, could not appreciate Mahārāja Bali’s promise. Śukrācārya gave Vedic evidence that one should not give everything to a poor man. Rather, when a poor man comes for charity one should untruthfully say, “Whatever I have I have given you. I have no more.” It is not that one should give everything to him. Actually the word *om* is meant for *oṁ tat sat,* the Absolute Truth. *Oṁkāra* is meant for freedom from all attachment to money because money should be spent for the purpose of the Supreme. The tendency of modern civilization is to give money in charity to the poor. Such charity has no spiritual value because we actually see that although there are so many hospitals and other foundations and institutions for the poor, according to the three modes of material nature a class of poor men is always destined to continue. Even though there are so many charitable institutions, poverty has not been driven from human society. Therefore it is recommended here, *bhikṣave sarvam oṁ kurvan nālaṁ kāmena cātmane.* One should not give everything to the beggars among the poor.

The best solution is that of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This movement is always kind to the poor, not only because it feeds them but also because it gives them enlightenment by teaching them how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. We are therefore opening hundreds and thousands of centers for those who are poor, both in money and in knowledge, to enlighten them in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and reform their character by teaching them how to avoid illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, which are the most sinful activities and which cause people to suffer, life after life. The best way to use money is to open such a center, where all may come live and reform their character. They may live very comfortably, without denial of any of the body’s necessities, but they live under spiritual control, and thus they live happily and save time for advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one has money, it should not be squandered away on nothing. It should be used to push forward the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement so that all of human society will become happy, prosperous and hopeful of being promoted back home, back to Godhead. The Vedic *mantra* in this regard reads as follows:

*parāg vā etad riktam akṣaraṁ yad etad om iti tad yat kiñcid om iti āhātraivāsmai tad ricyate; sa yat sarvam oṁ kuryād ricyād ātmānaṁ sa kāmebhyo nālaṁ syāt.*

*atha* — therefore; *etat* — that; *pūrṇam* — completely; *abhyātmam* — drawing the compassion of others by presenting oneself as always poverty-stricken; *yat* — that; *ca* — also; *na* — not; *iti* — thus; *anṛtam* — false; *vacaḥ* — words; *sarvam* — completely; *na* — not; *iti* — thus; *anṛtam* — falsity; *brūyāt* — who should say; *saḥ* — such a person; *duṣkīrtiḥ* — infamous; *śvasan* — while breathing or while alive; *mṛtaḥ* — is dead or should be killed.

### Translation

**Therefore, the safe course is to say no. Although it is a falsehood, it protects one completely, it draws the compassion of others toward oneself, and it gives one full facility to collect money from others for oneself. Nonetheless, if one always pleads that he has nothing, he is condemned, for he is a dead body while living, or while still breathing he should be killed.**

### Purport

Beggars always present themselves as possessing nothing, and this may be very good for them because in this way they are assured of not losing their money and of always drawing the attention and compassion of others for the sake of collection. But this is also condemned. If one purposely continues this professional begging, he is supposed to be dead while breathing, or, according to another interpretation, such a man of falsity should be killed while still breathing. The Vedic injunction in this regard is as follows: *athaitat pūrṇam abhyātmaṁ yan neti sa yat sarvaṁ neti brūyāt pāpikāsya kīrtir jāyate.* *sainaṁ tatraiva hanyāt.* If one continuously poses himself as possessing nothing and collects money by begging, he should be killed (*sainaṁ tatraiva hanyāt*).
