CHAPTER EIGHT

This chapter describes how the goddess of fortune appeared during the churning of the Ocean of Milk and how she accepted Lord Viṣṇu as her husband. As described later in the chapter, when Dhanvantari appeared with a pot of nectar the demons immediately snatched it from him, but Lord Viṣṇu appeared as the incarnation Mohinī, the most beautiful woman in the world, just to captivate the demons and save the nectar for the demigods.

After Lord Śiva drank all the poison, both the demigods and demons took courage and resumed their activities of churning. Because of this churning, first a *surabhi* cow was produced. Great saintly persons accepted this cow to derive clarified butter from its milk and offer this clarified butter in oblations for great sacrifices. Thereafter, a horse named Uccaiḥśravā was generated. This horse was taken by Bali Mahārāja. Then there appeared Airāvata and other elephants that could go anywhere in any direction, and she-elephants also appeared. The gem known as Kaustubha was also generated, and Lord Viṣṇu took that gem and placed it on His chest. Thereafter, a *pārijāta* flower and the Apsarās, the most beautiful women in the universe, were generated. Then the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, appeared. The demigods, great sages, Gandharvas and others offered her their respectful worship. The goddess of fortune could not find anyone to accept as her husband. At last she selected Lord Viṣṇu to be her master. Lord Viṣṇu gave her a place to stay everlastingly at His chest. Because of this combination of Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa, all who were present, including the demigods and people in general, were very pleased. The demons, however, being neglected by the goddess of fortune, were very depressed. Then Vāruṇī, the goddess of drinking, was generated, and by the order of Lord Viṣṇu the demons accepted her. Then the demons and demigods, with renewed energy, began to churn again. This time a partial incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu called Dhanvantari appeared. He was very beautiful, and he carried a jug containing nectar. The demons immediately snatched the jug from Dhanvantari’s hand and began to run away, and the demigods, being very morose, took shelter of Viṣṇu. After the demons snatched the jug from Dhanvantari, they began to fight among themselves. Lord Viṣṇu solaced the demigods, who therefore did not fight, but remained silent. While the fighting was going on among the demons, the Lord Himself appeared as the incarnation Mohinī, the most beautiful woman in the universe.

### Verse text

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*pīte gare vṛṣāṅkeṇa  
prītās te ’mara-dānavāḥ  
mamanthus tarasā sindhuṁ  
havirdhānī tato ’bhavat*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *pīte* — was drunk; *gare* — when the poison; *vṛṣa*-*aṅkeṇa* — by Lord Śiva, who sits on a bull; *prītāḥ* — being pleased; *te* — all of them; *amara* — the demigods; *dānavāḥ* — and the demons; *mamanthuḥ* — again began to churn; *tarasā* — with great force; *sindhum* — the Ocean of Milk; *havirdhānī* — the *surabhi* cow, who is the source of clarified butter; *tataḥ* — from that churning; *abhavat* — was generated.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Upon Lord Śiva’s drinking the poison, both the demigods and the demons, being very pleased, began to churn the ocean with renewed vigor. As a result of this, there appeared a cow known as surabhi.**

### Purport

The *surabhi* cow is described as *havirdhānī,* the source of butter. Butter, when clarified by melting, produces ghee, or clarified butter, which is inevitably necessary for performing great ritualistic sacrifices. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.5), *yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat:* sacrifice, charity and austerity are essential to keep human society perfect in peace and prosperity. *Yajña,* the performance of sacrifice, is essential; to perform *yajña,* clarified butter is absolutely necessary; and to get clarified butter, milk is necessary. Milk is produced when there are sufficient cows. Therefore in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.44), cow protection is recommended (*kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva jam*).

### Verse text

*tām agni-hotrīm ṛṣayo  
jagṛhur brahma-vādinaḥ  
yajñasya deva-yānasya  
medhyāya haviṣe nṛpa*

### Synonyms

*tām* — that cow; *agni*-*hotrīm* — absolutely necessary for the production of yogurt, milk and ghee to offer as oblations in the fire; *ṛṣayaḥ* — sages who perform such sacrifices; *jagṛhuḥ* — took in charge; *brahma*-*vādinaḥ* — because such sages know the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies; *yajñasya* — of sacrifice; *deva*-*yānasya* — which fulfills the desire to be elevated to the higher planetary systems and to Brahmaloka; *medhyāya* — fit for offering oblations; *haviṣe* — for the sake of pure clarified butter; *nṛpa* — O King.

### Translation

**O King Parīkṣit, great sages who were completely aware of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies took charge of that surabhi cow, which produced all the yogurt, milk and ghee absolutely necessary for offering oblations into the fire. They did this just for the sake of pure ghee, which they wanted for the performance of sacrifices to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems, up to Brahmaloka.**

### Purport

*Surabhi* cows are generally found on the Vaikuṇṭha planets. As described in *Brahma-saṁhitā,* Lord Kṛṣṇa, on His planet, Goloka Vṛndāvana, engages in tending the *surabhi* cows (*surabhīr abhipālayantam*). These cows are the Lord’s pet animals. From the *surabhi* cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires. In other words, the *surabhi* cow can yield milk unlimitedly. Milk is necessary for the performance of *yajña.* Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life. Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the *śāstras,* the *brahmāvādīs* took charge of the *surabhi* cow, in which the demons were not very interested.

### Translation

### Purport

*Śrī* means opulence. Kṛṣṇa is the owner of all opulences.

*bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ  
sarva-loka-maheśvaram  
suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati*

This peace formula for the world is given in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.29). When people know that the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor and the most intimate well-wishing friend of all living entities, peace and prosperity will ensue all over the world. Unfortunately, the conditioned souls, being placed into illusion by the external energy of the Lord, want to fight with one another, and therefore peace is disturbed. The first prerequisite for peace is that all the wealth presented by Śrī, the goddess of fortune, be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone should give up his false proprietorship over worldly possessions and offer everything to Kṛṣṇa. This is the teaching of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

*tasyāṁ cakruḥ spṛhāṁ sarve

### Synonyms

*tasyām* — unto her; *cakruḥ* — did; *spṛhām* — desire; *sarve* — everyone; *sa*-*sura*-*asura*-*mānavāḥ* — the demigods, the demons and the human beings; *rūpa*-*audārya* — by the exquisite beauty and bodily features; *vayaḥ* — youth; *varṇa* — complexion; *mahimā* — glories; *ākṣipta* — agitated; *cetasaḥ* — their minds.

### Translation

**Because of her exquisite beauty, her bodily features, her youth, her complexion and her glories, everyone, including the demigods, the demons and the human beings, desired her. They were attracted because she is the source of all opulences.**

### Purport

Who in this world does not want to possess wealth, beauty and the social respectability that come from these opulences? People generally desire material enjoyment, material opulence and the association of aristocratic family members (*bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānām*). Material enjoyment entails money, beauty and the reputation they bring, which can all be achieved by the mercy of the goddess of fortune. The goddess of fortune, however, never remains alone. As indicated in the previous verse by the word *bhagavat-parā,* she is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is enjoyable only by Him. If one wants the favor of the goddess of fortune, mother Lakṣmī, because she is by nature *bhagavat-parā* one must keep her with Nārāyaṇa. The devotees who always engage in the service of Nārāyaṇa (*nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa*) can easily achieve the favor of the goddess of fortune without a doubt, but materialists who try to get the favor of the goddess of fortune only to possess her for personal enjoyment are frustrated. Theirs is not a good policy. The celebrated demon Rāvaṇa, for example, wanted to deprive Rāmacandra of Lakṣmī, Sītā, and thus be victorious, but the result was just the opposite. Sītā, of course, was taken by force by Lord Rāmacandra, and Rāvaṇa and his entire material empire were vanquished. The goddess of fortune is desirable for everyone, including human beings, but one should understand that the goddess of fortune is the exclusive property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot achieve the mercy of the goddess of fortune unless one prays both to her and to the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead.

*ābhiṣecanikāḥ* — paraphernalia required for installing the Deity; *bhūmiḥ* — the land; *āharat* — collected; *sakala* — all kinds of; *auṣadhīḥ* — drugs and herbs; *gāvaḥ* — the cows; *pañca* — five different varieties of products from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, clarified butter, cow dung and cow urine; *pavitrāṇi* — uncontaminated; *vasantaḥ* — personified springtime; *madhu*-*mādhavau* — flowers and fruits produced during spring, or in the months of Caitra and Vaiśākha.

### Translation

**The land became a person and collected all the drugs and herbs needed for installing the Deity. The cows delivered five products, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, urine and cow dung, and spring personified collected everything produced in spring, during the months of Caitra and Vaiśākha \[April and May\].**

### Purport

*Pañca-gavya,* the five products received from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, cow dung and cow urine, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic directions. Cow urine and cow dung are uncontaminated, and since even the urine and dung of a cow are important, we can just imagine how important this animal is for human civilization. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, directly advocates *go-rakṣya,* the protection of cows. Civilized men who follow the system of *varṇāśrama,* especially those of the *vaiśya* class, who engage in agriculture and trade, must give protection to the cows. Unfortunately, because people in Kali-yuga are *mandāḥ,* all bad, and *sumanda-matayaḥ,* misled by false conceptions of life, they are killing cows in the thousands. Therefore they are unfortunate in spiritual consciousness, and nature disturbs them in so many ways, especially through incurable diseases like cancer and through frequent wars among nations. As long as human society continues to allow cows to be regularly killed in slaughterhouses, there cannot be any question of peace and prosperity.

The goddess of fortune is the most chaste, for she does not know anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

The goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, is described in this verse as *śriyam,* which means that she has six opulences — wealth, strength, influence, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. These opulences are received from the goddess of fortune. Lakṣmī is addressed here as *devī,* the goddess, because in Vaikuṇṭha she supplies all opulences to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, who in this way enjoy natural life in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with His consort, the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand. Mother Lakṣmī is described in this verse as *satī,* the supremely chaste, because she never diverts her attention from the Supreme Personality of Godhead to anyone else.

### Translation

**Thereafter, mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, having been properly celebrated with an auspicious ritualistic ceremony, began moving about, holding in her hand a garland of lotus flowers, which were surrounded by humming bumblebees. Smiling with shyness, her cheeks decorated by her earrings, she looked extremely beautiful.**

### Purport

The goddess of fortune, mother Lakṣmījī, accepted the Ocean of Milk as her father, but she perpetually rests on the bosom of Nārāyaṇa. She offers benedictions even to Lord Brahmā and other living entities in this material world, yet she is transcendental to all material qualities. Although she appeared to have been born of the Ocean of Milk, she immediately resorted to her eternal place on the bosom of Nārāyaṇa.

### Translation

**While walking among the Gandharvas, Yakṣas, asuras, Siddhas, Cāraṇas and denizens of heaven, Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune, was scrutinizingly examining them, but she could not find anyone naturally endowed with all good qualities. None of them was devoid of faults, and therefore she could not take shelter of any of them.**

### Purport

The goddess of fortune, Lakṣmīdevī, having been generated from the Ocean of Milk, was the daughter of the ocean. Thus she was allowed to select her own husband in a *svayaṁvara* ceremony. She examined every one of the candidates, but she could not find anyone suitably qualified to be her shelter. In other words, Nārāyaṇa, the natural husband of Lakṣmī, cannot be superseded by anyone in this material world.

### Synonyms

*nūnam* — certainly; *tapaḥ* — austerity; *yasya* — of someone; *na* — not; *manyu* — anger; *nirjayaḥ* — conquered; *jñānam* — knowledge; *kvacit* — in some saintly person; *tat* — that; *ca* — also; *na* — not; *saṅga*-*varjitam* — without the contamination of association; *kaścit* — someone; *mahān* — a very great exalted person; *tasya* — his; *na* — not; *kāma* — material desires; *nirjayaḥ* — conquered; *saḥ* — such a person; *īśvaraḥ* — controller; *kim* — how can he be; *parataḥ* — of others; *vyapāśrayaḥ* — under the control.

### Translation

**The goddess of fortune, examining the assembly, thought in this way: Someone who has undergone great austerity has not yet conquered anger. Someone possesses knowledge, but he has not conquered material desires. Someone is a very great personality, but he cannot conquer lusty desires. Even a great personality depends on something else. How, then, can he be the supreme controller?**

### Purport

Here is an attempt to find the supreme controller, or *īśvara.* Everyone may be accepted as an *īśvara,* or controller, but still such controllers are controlled by others. For example, one may have undergone severe austerities but still be under the control of anger. By a scrutinizing analysis, we find that everyone is controlled by something else. No one, therefore, can be the true controller but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. This is supported by the *śāstras.* *Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ:* the supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is never controlled by anyone, for He is the controller of everyone (*sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam*).

### Synonyms

*dharmaḥ* — religion; *kvacit* — one may have full knowledge of; *tatra* — therein; *na* — not; *bhūta*-*sauhṛdam* — friendship with other living entities; *tyāgaḥ* — renunciation; *kvacit* — one may possess; *tatra* — therein; *na* — not; *mukti*-*kāraṇam* — the cause of liberation; *vīryam* — power; *na* — not; *puṁsaḥ* — of any person; *asti* — there may be; *aja*-*vega*-*niṣkṛtam* — no release from the power of time; *na* — nor; *hi* — indeed; *dvitīyaḥ* — the second one; *guṇa*-*saṅga*-*varjitaḥ* — completely freed from the contamination of the modes of nature.

### Translation

**Someone may possess full knowledge of religion but still not be kind to all living entities. In someone, whether human or demigod, there may be renunciation, but that is not the cause of liberation. Someone may possess great power and yet be unable to check the power of eternal time. Someone else may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the material modes of nature.**

### Purport

The statement *dharmaḥ kvacit tatra na bhūta-sauhṛdam* is very important in this verse. We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities. Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals. Such religion has no meaning. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.8) says:

*dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ  
viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ  
notpādayed yadi ratiṁ  
śrama eva hi kevalam*

One may be very expert in following the religious principles of his own sect, but if he has no tendency to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his observance of religious principles is simply a waste of time. One must develop a sense of loving Vāsudeva (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ*). The sign of a devotee is that he is a friend to everyone (*suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām*). A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion. This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

We find that there have been many great heroes in history, but they could not escape from the cruel hands of death. Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when Kṛṣṇa comes as death. That is described by Kṛṣṇa Himself: *mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham.* The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero’s so-called power. Even Hiraṇyakaśipu could not be saved when Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared before him as death. One’s material strength is nothing before the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Someone may have longevity but not have auspiciousness or good behavior. Someone may have both auspiciousness and good behavior, but the duration of his life is not fixed. Although such demigods as Lord Śiva have eternal life, they have inauspicious habits like living in crematoriums. And even if others are well qualified in all respects, they are not devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: In this way, after full deliberation, the goddess of fortune accepted Mukunda as her husband because although He is independent and not in want of her, He possesses all transcendental qualities and mystic powers and is therefore the most desirable.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is self-sufficient. Since He is fully independent, He was not in want of the support or association of Lakṣmīdevī. Nonetheless, Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune, accepted Him as her husband.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of the three worlds, and His bosom is the residence of mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, the proprietor of all opulences. The goddess of fortune, by her favorable and merciful glance, can increase the opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants and their directors, the demigods.**

### Purport

According to the desire of Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune, the Supreme Personality of Godhead made His bosom her residence so that by her glance she could favor everyone, including the demigods and ordinary human beings. In other words, since the goddess of fortune stays on the bosom of Nārāyaṇa, she naturally sees any devotee who worships Nārāyaṇa. When the goddess of fortune understands that a devotee is in favor of devotional service to Nārāyaṇa, she is naturally inclined to bless the devotee with all opulences. The *karmīs* try to receive the favor and mercy of Lakṣmī, but because they are not devotees of Nārāyaṇa, their opulence is flickering. The opulence of devotees who are attached to the service of Nārāyaṇa is not like the opulence of *karmīs.* The opulence of devotees is as permanent as the opulence of Nārāyaṇa Himself.

### Translation

**O King, a quarrel then arose among the demons over who would get the nectar first. Each of them said, “You cannot drink it first. I must drink it first. Me first, not you!”**

### Purport

This is the symptom of demons. The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense gratification at once, whereas the devotee’s first concern is to satisfy the Lord. This is the distinction between the nondevotee and the devotee. In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his own senses. Therefore, unless such demons become Kṛṣṇa conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods. The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is always anxious to satisfy their ambitions. While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be successful.

### Translation

**Some of the demons said, “All the demigods have taken part in churning the Ocean of Milk. Now, as everyone has an equal right to partake in any public sacrifice, according to the eternal religious system it is befitting that the demigods now have a share of the nectar.” O King, in this way the weaker demons forbade the stronger demons to take the nectar.**

### Purport

Desiring to take the nectar, those among the demons who were less strong spoke in favor of the demigods. The weaker Daityas naturally pleaded on behalf of the demigods to stop the stronger Daityas from drinking the nectar without sharing it. In this way, disagreement and trouble arose as they forbade one another to drink the nectar.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, who can counteract any unfavorable situation, then assumed the form of an extremely beautiful woman. This incarnation as a woman, Mohinī-mūrti, was most pleasing to the mind. Her complexion resembled in color a newly grown blackish lotus, and every part of Her body was beautifully situated. Her ears were equally decorated with earrings, Her cheeks were very beautiful, Her nose was raised and Her face full of youthful luster. Her large breasts made Her waist seem very thin. Attracted by the aroma of Her face and body, bumblebees hummed around Her, and thus Her eyes were restless. Her hair, which was extremely beautiful, was garlanded with mallikā flowers. Her attractively constructed neck was decorated with a necklace and other ornaments, Her arms were decorated with bangles, Her body was covered with a clean sari, and Her breasts seemed like islands in an ocean of beauty. Her legs were decorated with ankle bells. Because of the movements of Her eyebrows as She smiled with shyness and glanced over the demons, all the demons were saturated with lusty desires, and every one of them desired to possess Her.**

### Purport

Because of the Supreme Lord’s assuming the form of a beautiful woman to arouse the lusty desires of the demons, a description of Her complete beauty is given here.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Churning of the Milk Ocean.”*
