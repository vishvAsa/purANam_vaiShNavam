CHAPTER FIVE

This chapter describes the fifth and sixth Manus, and it also describes the prayers of the demigods and the curse of Durvāsā Muni.

The brother of Tāmasa, the fourth Manu, who has previously been described, was the fifth Manu, Raivata. The sons of Raivata included Arjuna, Bali and Vindhya. During the reign of this Manu, Indra, the King of heaven, was known as Vibhu. Among the demigods were the Bhūtarayas, and among the seven *ṛṣis* were Hiraṇyaromā, Vedaśirā and Ūrdhvabāhu. The *ṛṣi* known as Śubhra, by his wife, Vikuṇṭhā, gave birth to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuṇṭha. This Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested a Vaikuṇṭha planet at the request of Ramādevī. His power and activities are mentioned in the Third Canto.

The sixth Manu was Cākṣuṣa, the son of Cakṣu Manu. Among the sons of the sixth Manu were Pūru, Pūruṣa and Sudyumna. During the reign of this Manu, Mantradruma was Indra, the King of the heavenly planets. Among the demigods were the Āpyas, and among the seven *ṛṣis* were Haviṣmān and Vīraka. The wife of Vairāja, whose name was Devasambhūti, gave birth to Ajita, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This Ajita, taking the shape of a tortoise and holding the mountain known as Mandara on His back, churned the ocean and produced nectar for the demigods.

Mahārāja Parīkṣit was very eager to hear about the churning of the ocean, and therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī began to explain to him how the demigods, having been cursed by Durvāsā Muni, were defeated in battle by the *asuras.* When the demigods were deprived of their heavenly kingdom, they went to the assembly house of Lord Brahmā and informed Lord Brahmā of what had happened. Then Brahmā, along with all the demigods, went to the shore of the Ocean of Milk and offered prayers to Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

As described in the Second Canto, Lord Brahmā saw Vaikuṇṭha before the creation of the universe. Vīrarāghava Ācārya mentions that this Vaikuṇṭha is within the universe.

तस्यानुभाव- कथितो गुणाश्च परमोदया- ।

### Verse text

*tasyānubhāvaḥ kathito  
guṇāś ca paramodayāḥ  
bhaumān reṇūn sa vimame  
yo viṣṇor varṇayed guṇān*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Although the great activities and transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s various incarnations are wonderfully described, sometimes we are unable to understand them. Yet everything is possible for Lord Viṣṇu. If one could count the atoms of the universe, then he could count the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But no one can count the atoms of the universe, nor can anyone count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.**

### Purport

The Lord’s glorious activities referred to in this connection took place after His personal bodyguards Jaya and Vijaya became Daityas, having been cursed by the great sages Sanaka, Sanātana, Sanat-kumāra and Sanandana. Jaya, as Hiraṇyākṣa, had to fight with Varāhadeva, and that same Varāhadeva is mentioned in regard to the Raivata millennium. The fighting, however, took place during the reign of the first Manu, Svāyambhuva. Therefore according to some authorities there are two Varāhas. According to others, however, Varāha appeared during the regime of Svāyambhuva Manu and stayed in the water until that of Raivata Manu. Some may doubt that this could be possible, but the answer is that everything is possible. If one could count the atoms within the universe, one could count the qualities of Lord Viṣṇu. But the atoms of the universe are impossible for anyone to count, and similarly no one can count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: When the asuras, with their serpent weapons, severely attacked the demigods in a fight, many of the demigods fell and lost their lives. Indeed, they could not be revived. At that time, O King, the demigods had been cursed by Durvāsā Muni, the three worlds were poverty-stricken, and therefore ritualistic ceremonies could not be performed. The effects of this were very serious.**

### Purport

It is described that while Durvāsā Muni was passing on the road, he saw Indra on the back of his elephant and was pleased to offer Indra a garland from his own neck. Indra, however, being too puffed up, took the garland, and without respect for Durvāsā Muni, he placed it on the trunk of his carrier elephant. The elephant, being an animal, could not understand the value of the garland, and thus the elephant threw the garland between its legs and smashed it. Seeing this insulting behavior, Durvāsā Muni immediately cursed Indra to be poverty-stricken, bereft of all material opulence. Thus the demigods, afflicted on one side by the fighting demons and on the other by the curse of Durvāsā Muni, lost all the material opulences in the three worlds.

To be extremely opulent in materialistic advancement is sometimes very risky. The materially opulent person does not care about anyone, and thus he commits offenses to great personalities, such as devotees and great saints. This is the way of material opulence. As described by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, *dhana-durmadāndha:* too much wealth makes one blind. This happens even to Indra in his heavenly kingdom, and what to speak of others in this material world? When one is materially opulent, he should learn to be sober and well-behaved toward Vaiṣṇavas and saintly persons; otherwise he will fall down.

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — Lord Brahmā; *vilokya* — looking over; *indra*-*vāyu*-*ādīn* — all the demigods, headed by Lord Indra and Vāyu; *niḥsattvān* — bereft of all spiritual potency; *vigata*-*prabhān* — bereft of all effulgence; *lokān* — all the three worlds; *amaṅgala*-*prāyān* — merged into misfortune; *asurān* — all the demons; *ayathāḥ* — flourishing; *vibhuḥ* — Lord Brahmā, the supreme within this material world; *samāhitena* — by full adjustment; *manasā* — of the mind; *saṁsmaran* — remembering again and again; *puruṣam* — the Supreme Person; *param* — transcendental; *uvāca* — said; *utphulla*-*vadanaḥ* — bright-faced; *devān* — unto the demigods; *saḥ* — he; *bhagavān* — the most powerful; *paraḥ* — of the demigods.

### Translation

**Upon seeing that the demigods were bereft of all influence and strength and that the three worlds were consequently devoid of auspiciousness, and upon seeing that the demigods were in an awkward position whereas all the demons were flourishing, Lord Brahmā, who is above all the demigods and who is most powerful, concentrated his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus being encouraged, he became bright-faced and spoke to the demigods as follows.**

### Purport

After hearing from the demigods the real situation, Lord Brahmā was very much concerned because the demons were unnecessarily so powerful. When demons become powerful, the entire world is placed in an awkward position because demons are simply interested in their own sense gratification and not in the welfare of the world. Demigods or devotees, however, are concerned with the welfare of all living beings. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, for example, left his ministership and went to Vṛndāvana for the benefit of the entire world (*lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau*). This is the nature of a saintly person or demigod. Even impersonalists think of the welfare of all people. Thus Brahmā was very much concerned at seeing the demons in power.

### Translation

**Lord Brahmā said: I, Lord Śiva, all of you demigods, the demons, the living entities born of perspiration, the living beings born of eggs, the trees and plants sprouting from the earth, and the living entities born from embryos — all come from the Supreme Lord, from His incarnation of rajo-guṇa \[Lord Brahmā, the guṇa-avatāra\] and from the great sages \[ṛṣis\] who are part of me. Let us therefore go to the Supreme Lord and take shelter of His lotus feet.**

### Purport

Some creatures are born from embryos, some from perspiration, and some from seeds. In this way, all living entities emanate from the *guṇa-avatāra* of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ultimately, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the shelter of all living entities.

### Translation

**For the Supreme Personality of Godhead there is no one to be killed, no one to be protected, no one to be neglected and no one to be worshiped. Nonetheless, for the sake of creation, maintenance and annihilation according to time, He accepts different forms as incarnations either in the mode of goodness, the mode of passion or the mode of ignorance.**

### Purport

This verse explains that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equal to everyone. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.29):

*samo ’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu  
na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ  
ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā  
mayi te teṣu cāpy aham*

“I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.” Although the Lord is impartial, He gives special attention to His devotees. Therefore the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.8):

*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ  
vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām  
dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya  
sambhavāmi yuge yuge*

“To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear millennium after millennium.” The Lord has nothing to do with anyone’s protection or destruction, but for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world He apparently has to act either in goodness, in passion or in darkness. Actually, however, He is unaffected by these modes of material nature. He is the Supreme Lord of everyone. As a king sometimes punishes or rewards someone to maintain law and order, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although having nothing to do with the activities of this material world, sometimes appears as various incarnations according to the time, place and object.

### Translation

**Now is the time to invoke the mode of goodness of the living entities who have accepted material bodies. The mode of goodness is meant to establish the Supreme Lord’s rule, which will maintain the existence of the creation. Therefore, this is the opportune moment to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because He is naturally very kind and dear to the demigods, He will certainly bestow good fortune upon us.**

### Purport

The material world is conducted by the three modes of nature, namely *sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa.* By *rajo-guṇa* everything material is created, by *sattva-guṇa* everything material is maintained properly, and by *tamo-guṇa,* when the creation is improperly situated, everything is destroyed.

From this verse we can understand the situation of Kali-yuga, through which we are now passing. Just before the beginning of Kali-yuga — or, in other words, at the end of Dvāpara-yuga — Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared and left His instructions in the form of *Bhagavad-gītā,* in which He asked all living entities to surrender unto Him. Since the beginning of Kali-yuga, however, people have practically been unable to surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore, after some five thousand years, Kṛṣṇa came again as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu just to teach the entire world how to surrender unto Him, unto Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus be purified.

Surrendering unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa means achieving complete purification. Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.66):

*sarva-dharmān parityajya  
mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja  
ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo  
mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ*

“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Thus as soon as one surrenders unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, one certainly becomes free from all contamination.

Kali-yuga is full of contamination. This is described in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (12.3.51):

*kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann  
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ  
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya  
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet*

This Age of Kali is full of unlimited faults. Indeed, it is just like an ocean of faults (*doṣa-nidhi*). But there is one chance, one opportunity. *Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:* simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra,* one can be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga and, in his original spiritual body, can return home, back to Godhead. This is the opportunity of Kali-yuga.

When Kṛṣṇa appeared, He gave His orders, and when Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared as a devotee, as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He showed us the path by which to cross the ocean of Kali-yuga. That is the path of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared, He ushered in the era for the *saṅkīrtana* movement. It is also said that for ten thousand years this era will continue. This means that simply by accepting the *saṅkīrtana* movement and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* the fallen souls of this Kali-yuga will be delivered. After the Battle of Kurukṣetra, at which *Bhagavad-gītā* was spoken, Kali-yuga continues for 432,000 years, of which only 5,000 years have passed. Thus there is still a balance of 427,000 years to come. Of these 427,000 years, the 10,000 years of the *saṅkīrtana* movement inaugurated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu 500 years ago provide the opportunity for the fallen souls of Kali-yuga to take to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and thus be delivered from the clutches of material existence and return home, back to Godhead.

Chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* is potent always, but it is especially potent in this Age of Kali. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī, while instructing Mahārāja Parīkṣit, stressed this chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.*

*kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann  
asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ  
kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya  
mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet*

“My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age. It is that simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom.” (*Bhāg.* 12.3.51) Those who have accepted the task of spreading the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness should take this opportunity to deliver people very easily from the clutches of material existence. Our duty, therefore, is to follow the instructions of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and preach the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world very sincerely. This is the best welfare activity for the peace and prosperity of human society.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement consists of spreading *kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana.* *Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam:* “All glories to the Śrī Kṛṣṇa *saṅkīrtana*!” Why is it so glorious? This has also been explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. *Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam:* by the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one’s heart is cleansed. The whole difficulty is that in this Age of Kali there is no *sattva-guṇa* and no clearance of the heart, and therefore people are making the mistake of identifying with their bodies. Even the big philosophers and scientists with whom we deal are practically all under the impression that they are their bodies. The other day we were discussing a prominent philosopher, Thomas Huxley, who was proud of being an Englishman. This means that he was in the bodily conception of life. Everywhere we find this same misunderstanding. As soon as one is in the bodily conception of life, one is nothing but an animal like a cat or a dog (*sa eva go-kharaḥ*). Thus the most dangerous of the dirty things within our hearts is this misidentification of the body as the self. Under the influence of this misunderstanding, one thinks, “I am this body. I am an Englishman. I am an Indian. I am an American. I am Hindu. I am Muslim.” This misconception is the strongest impediment, and it must be removed. That is the instruction of *Bhagavad-gītā* and of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Indeed, *Bhagavad-gītā* begins with this instruction:

*dehino ’smin yathā dehe  
kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā  
tathā dehāntara-prāptir  
dhīras tatra na muhyati*

“As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.” (Bg. 2.13) Although the soul is within the body, nevertheless, because of misunderstanding and animal propensities one accepts the body as the self. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says, *ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.* To cleanse the core of the heart, which is full of misunderstanding, is possible only through *śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana.* The leaders of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should very seriously take this opportunity to be kind to the fallen souls by delivering them from the misunderstanding of materialistic life.

One cannot be happy in any way within this material world. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.16):

*ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ  
punar āvartino ’rjuna*

“From the highest planet in this material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.” Therefore, not to speak of going to the moon, even if one is promoted to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, there cannot be any happiness in this material world. If one actually wants happiness, one must go to the spiritual world. The material world is characterized by a struggle for existence, and survival of the fittest is a well-known principle, but the poor souls of this material world do not know what is survival and who is fit. Survival does not mean that one should die; survival means that one should not die, but should enjoy an everlastingly blissful life of knowledge. This is survival. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to make every person fit for survival. Indeed, it is meant to stop the struggle for existence. The *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and *Bhagavad-gītā* give definite directions on how to stop the struggle for existence and how to survive in eternal life. The *saṅkīrtana* movement, therefore, is a great opportunity. Simply by hearing *Bhagavad-gītā* and chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* one becomes completely purified. Thus the struggle for existence ceases, and one goes back home, back to Godhead.

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*ity ābhāṣya surān vedhāḥ  
saha devair arindama  
ajitasya padaṁ sākṣāj  
jagāma tamasaḥ param*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *iti* — thus; *ābhāṣya* — talking; *surān* — unto the demigods; *vedhāḥ* — Lord Brahmā, who is the head of this universe and who gives everyone good sense in Vedic knowledge; *saha* — with; *devaiḥ* — the demigods; *arim*-*dama* — O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, subduer of all kinds of enemies (such as the senses); *ajitasya* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *padam* — to the place; *sākṣāt* — directly; *jagāma* — went; *tamasaḥ* — the world of darkness; *param* — transcendental to, beyond.

### Translation

**O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, subduer of all enemies, after Lord Brahmā finished speaking to the demigods, he took them with him to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is beyond this material world. The Lord’s abode is on an island called Śvetadvīpa, which is situated in the Ocean of Milk.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Parīkṣit is addressed here as *arindama,* “subduer of all enemies.” Not only do we have enemies outside of our bodies, but within our bodies there are many enemies, such as lusty desires, anger and greed. Mahārāja Parīkṣit is specifically addressed as *arindama* because in his political life he was able to subdue all kinds of enemies, and even though he was a young king, as soon as he heard that he was going to die within seven days, he immediately left his kingdom. He did not follow the dictates of enemies within his body, such as lust, greed and anger. He was not at all angry with the *muni’s* son who had cursed him. Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit, while fully alive, wanted to hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* He is consequently addressed here as *arindama.*

Another word, *sura-priya,* is also significant. Although Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward His devotees (*ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā mayi te teṣu cāpy aham*). The devotees are all demigods. There are two kinds of men within this world. One is called the *deva,* and the other is called the *asura.* The *Padma Purāṇa* states:

*dvau bhūta-sargau loke ’smin  
daiva āsura eva ca  
viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daiva  
āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ*

Anyone who is a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is called a *deva,* and others, even though they may be devotees of demigods, are called *asuras.* Rāvaṇa, for example, was a great devotee of Lord Śiva, but he is described as an *asura.* Similarly, Hiraṇyakaśipu is described as a great devotee of Lord Brahmā, yet he was also an *asura.* Therefore, only the devotee of Lord Viṣṇu is called *sura,* not *asura.* Lord Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased with His devotees, even if they are not on the topmost stage of devotional service. Even on the lower stages of devotional service one is transcendental, and if one continues with devotional life, he continues to be a *deva* or *sura.* If one continues in this way, Kṛṣṇa will always be pleased with him and will give him all instructions so that he may very easily return home, back to Godhead.

Concerning *ajitasya padam,* the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the Milk Ocean of this material world, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says: *padaṁ kṣīrodadhi-stha-śvetadvīpaṁ tamasaḥ prakṛteḥ param.* The island known as Śvetadvīpa, which is in the Ocean of Milk, is transcendental. It has nothing to do with this material world. A city government may have a rest house where the governor and important government officers stay. Such a rest house is not an ordinary house. Similarly, although Śvetadvīpa, which is in the Ocean of Milk, is in this material world, it is *paraṁ padam,* transcendental.

*tatra* — there (at the Lord’s abode known as Śvetadvīpa); *adṛṣṭa*-*svarūpāya* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was not seen even by Lord Brahmā; *śruta*-*pūrvāya* — but who was heard about from the *Vedas*; *vai* — indeed; *prabhuḥ* — Lord Brahmā; *stutim* — prayers derived from Vedic literature; *abrūta* — performed; *daivībhiḥ* — by prayers mentioned in the Vedic literature or offered by persons strictly following Vedic principles; *gīrbhiḥ* — by such sound vibrations or songs; *tu* — then; *avahita*-*indriyaḥ* — fixed in mind, without deviation.

### Translation

**There \[at Śvetadvīpa\], Lord Brahmā offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though he had never seen the Supreme Lord. Simply because Lord Brahmā had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.**

### Purport

It is said that when Brahmā and the other demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Śvetadvīpa, they cannot directly see Him, but their prayers are heard by the Lord, and the needful action is taken. This we have seen in many instances. The word *śruta-pūrvāya* is significant. We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing. If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources. Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God. This is ludicrous. It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God. Our sensory perception is always incomplete. Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him. When Kṛṣṇa was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam.* Even though the rascals and fools saw Kṛṣṇa personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him. Therefore we have to hear about God, Kṛṣṇa, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly. Even though Brahmā had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in Śvetadvīpa. Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord.

These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers. Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words *daivībhir gīrbhiḥ.* In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees. We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple. We generally sing two songs. One is *śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.* This is bona fide. It is always mentioned in the *Caitanya-caritāmṛta,* and it is accepted by the *ācāryas.* The other, of course, is the *mahā-mantra* — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. We may also sing the songs of Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, but these two songs — “*śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya*” and the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* — are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him. Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons.

**Lord Brahmā said: O Supreme Lord, O changeless, unlimited supreme truth. You are the origin of everything. Being all-pervading, You are in everyone’s heart and also in the atom. You have no material qualities. Indeed, You are inconceivable. The mind cannot catch You by speculation, and words fail to describe You. You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone. We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not anything of material creation. Everything material must change from one form to another — for example, from earth to earthen pot and from earthen pot to earth again. All our creations are temporary, impermanent. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is eternal, and similarly the living entities, who are parts of Him, are also eternal (*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ*). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is *sanātana,* eternal, and the individual living entities are also eternal. The difference is that Kṛṣṇa, or God, is the supreme eternal, whereas the individual souls are minute, fragmental eternals. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (13.3), *kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.* Although the Lord is a living being and the individual souls are living beings, the Supreme Lord, unlike the individual souls, is *vibhu,* all-pervading, and *ananta,* unlimited. The Lord is the cause of everything. The living entities are innumerable, but the Lord is one. No one is greater than Him, and no one is equal to Him. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object, as understood from the Vedic *mantras* (*na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate*). The Lord is supreme because no one can evaluate Him by mental speculation or jugglery of words. The Lord can travel more quickly than the mind. In the *śruti-mantras* of *Īśopaniṣad* it is said:

*anejad ekaṁ manaso javīyo  
nainad devā āpnuvan pūrvam arṣat  
tad dhāvato ’nyān atyeti tiṣṭhat  
tasminn apo mātariśvā dadhāti*

“Although fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain. He surpasses all in excellence.” (*Īśopaniṣad* 4) Thus the Supreme is never to be equaled by the subordinate living entities.

Because the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart and the individual living entity is not, never should the individual living entity be equated with the Supreme Lord. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15) the Lord says, *sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:* “I am situated in everyone’s heart.” This does not mean, however, that everyone is equal to the Lord. In the *śruti-mantras* it is also said, *hṛdi hy ayam ātmā pratiṣṭhitaḥ.* In the beginning of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* it is said, *satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.* The Vedic *mantras* say, *satyaṁ jñānam anantam* and *niṣkalaṁ niṣkriyaṁ śāntaṁ niravadyam.* God is supreme. Although naturally He does not do anything, He is doing everything. As the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā:*

*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ  
jagad avyakta-mūrtinā  
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni  
na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*

“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” (Bg. 9.4)

*mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ  
sūyate sacarācaram  
hetunānena kaunteya  
jagad viparivartate*

“This material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.” (Bg. 9.10) Thus although the Lord is silent in His abode, He is doing everything through His different energies (*parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate*).

All the Vedic *mantras,* or *śruti-mantras,* are included in this verse spoken by Lord Brahmā, for Brahmā and his followers, the Brahma *sampradāya,* understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the *paramparā* system. We have to gain understanding through the words of our predecessors. There are twelve *mahājanas,* or authorities, of whom Brahmā is one.

*svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ  
kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ  
prahlādo janako bhīṣmo  
balir vaiyāsakir vayam*

(*Bhāg.* 6.3.20)

We belong to the disciplic succession of Brahmā, and therefore we are known as the Brahma *sampradāya.* As the demigods follow Lord Brahmā to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also have to follow the authorities of the *paramparā* system to understand the Lord.

### Synonyms

*vipaścitam* — unto the omniscient; *prāṇa* — how the living force is working; *manaḥ* — how the mind is working; *dhiya* — how the intelligence is working; *ātmanām* — of all living entities; *artha* — the objects of the senses; *indriya* — the senses; *ābhāsam* — knowledge; *anidram* — always awake and free from ignorance; *avraṇam* — without a material body subject to pains and pleasures; *chāyā*-*ātapau* — the shelter for all who are suffering from ignorance; *yatra* — wherein; *na* — not; *gṛdhra*-*pakṣau* — partiality toward any living being; *tam* — unto Him; *akṣaram* — infallible; *kham* — all-pervading like the sky; *tri*-*yugam* — appearing with six opulences in three *yugas* (Satya, Tretā and Dvāpara); *vrajāmahe* — I take shelter.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead directly and indirectly knows how everything, including the living force, mind and intelligence, is working under His control. He is the illuminator of everything and has no ignorance. He does not have a material body subject to the reactions of previous activities, and He is free from the ignorance of partiality and materialistic education. I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, all-pervading and as great as the sky and who appears with six opulences in three yugas \[Satya, Tretā and Dvāpara\].**

### Purport

In the beginning of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this way: *janmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ.* The Lord is the origin of all emanations, and He directly and indirectly knows everything about all the activities within His creation. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as *vipaścitam,* one who is full of all knowledge or who knows everything. The Lord is the Supreme Soul, and He knows everything about the living entities and their senses.

The word *anidram,* meaning “always awake and free from ignorance,” is very important in this verse. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15), *mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:* it is the Lord who gives intelligence to everyone and who causes everyone to forget. There are millions and millions of living entities, and the Lord gives them directions. Therefore He has no time to sleep, and He is never in ignorance of our activities. The Lord is the witness of everything; He sees what we are doing at every moment. The Lord is not covered by a body resulting from *karma.* Our bodies are formed as a result of our past deeds (*karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa*), but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not have a material body, and therefore He has no *avidyā,* ignorance. He does not sleep, but is always alert and awake.

The Supreme Lord is described as *tri-yuga* because although He appeared variously in Satya-yuga, Tretā-yuga and Dvāpara-yuga, when He appeared in Kali-yuga He never declared Himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ  
sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam*

The Lord appears in Kali-yuga as a devotee. Thus although He is Kṛṣṇa, He chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* like a devotee. Still, *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.32) recommends:

*yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair  
yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ*

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, whose complexion is not black like that of Kṛṣṇa but is golden (*tviṣākṛṣṇam*), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is accompanied by associates like Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa. Those who are sufficiently intelligent worship this Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* In this incarnation, the Supreme Lord declares Himself not to be the Supreme Lord, and therefore He is known as Tri-yuga.

### Synonyms

*ajasya* — of the living being; *cakram* — the wheel (the cycle of birth and death in this material world); *tu* — but; *ajayā* — by the external energy of the Supreme Lord; *īryamāṇam* — going around with great force; *manaḥ*-*mayam* — which is nothing but a mental creation depending chiefly on the mind; *pañcadaśa* — fifteen; *aram* — possessing spokes; *āśu* — very quick; *tri*-*nābhi* — having three naves (the three modes of material nature); *vidyut* — like electricity; *calam* — moving; *aṣṭa*-*nemi* — made of eight fellies (the eight external energies of the Lord — *bhūmir āpo ’nalo vāyuḥ,* etc.); *yat* — who; *akṣam* — the hub; *āhuḥ* — they say; *tam* — unto Him; *ṛtam* — the fact; *prapadye* — let us offer our respectful obeisances.

### Translation

**In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot. The ten senses \[five for working and five for gathering knowledge\] and the five life airs within the body form the fifteen spokes of the chariot’s wheel. The three modes of nature \[goodness, passion and ignorance\] are its center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature \[earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego\] comprise the rim of the wheel. The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical energy. Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth. We offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.**

### Purport

The cycle of repeated birth and death is figuratively described herein. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.5):

*apareyam itas tv anyāṁ  
prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām  
jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho  
yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat*

The entire world is going on because the living entity, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is utilizing the material energy. Under the clutches of the material energy, the *jīvātmā* is revolving on the wheel of birth and death under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the Supersoul. As explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.61):

*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ  
hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati  
bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni  
yantrārūḍhāni māyayā*

“The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.” The material body of the living entity is a result of the conditioned soul’s activities, and because the supporter is the Supersoul, the Supersoul is the true reality. Every one of us, therefore, should offer respectful obeisances to this central reality. One should not be misguided by the activities of this material world and forget the central point, the Absolute Truth. That is the instruction given here by Lord Brahmā.

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; *eka*-*varṇam* — absolute, situated in pure goodness; *tamasaḥ* — to the darkness of the material world; *param* — transcendental; *tat* — that; *alokam* — who cannot be seen; *avyaktam* — not manifested; *ananta*-*pāram* — unlimited, beyond the measurement of material time and space; *āsām* *cakāra* — situated; *upa*-*suparṇam* — on the back of Garuḍa; *enam* — Him; *upāsate* — worship; *yoga*-*rathena* — by the vehicle of mystic *yoga*; *dhīrāḥ* — persons who are sober, undisturbed by material agitation.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness \[śuddha-sattva\], and therefore He is eka-varṇa — the oṁkāra \[praṇava\]. Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes. Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by time or space, but is present everywhere. Seated on His carrier, Garuḍa, He is worshiped by means of mystical yogic power by those who have achieved freedom from agitation. Let us all offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.**

### Purport

*Sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vasudeva-śabditam* (*Bhāg.* 4.3.23). In this material world, the three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — prevail. Among these three, goodness is the platform of knowledge, and passion brings about a mixture of knowledge and ignorance, but the mode of ignorance is full of darkness. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond darkness and passion. He is on the platform where goodness or knowledge is not disturbed by passion and ignorance. This is called the *vasudeva* platform. It is on this platform of *vasudeva* that Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, can appear. Thus Kṛṣṇa appeared on this planet as the son of Vasudeva. Because the Lord is situated beyond the three modes of material nature, He is unseen by those who are dominated by these three modes. One must therefore become *dhīra,* or undisturbed by the modes of material nature. The process of *yoga* may be practiced by one who is free from the agitation of these modes. Therefore *yoga* is defined in this way: *yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.* As previously explained, we are disturbed by the *indriyas,* or senses. Moreover, we are agitated by the three modes of material nature, which are imposed upon us by the external energy. In conditional life, the living entity moves turbulently in the whirlpool of birth and death, but when one is situated on the transcendental platform of *viśuddha-sattva,* pure goodness, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits on the back of Garuḍa. Lord Brahmā offers his respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Lord.

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *yasya* — of whom (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); *kaśca* — anyone; *atititarti* — is able to overcome; *māyām* — the illusory energy; *yayā* — by whom (by the illusory energy); *janaḥ* — people in general; *muhyati* — become bewildered; *veda* — understand; *na* — not; *artham* — the aim of life; *tam* — unto Him (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); *nirjita* — completely controlling; *ātmā* — the living entities; *ātma*-*guṇam* — and His external energy; *para*-*īśam* — the Lord, who is transcendentally situated; *namāma* — we offer our respectful obeisances; *bhūteṣu* — unto all living beings; *samam* — equally situated, or equipoised; *carantam* — controlling or ruling them.

### Translation

**No one can overcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s illusory energy \[māyā\], which is so strong that it bewilders everyone, making one lose the sense to understand the aim of life. That same māyā, however, is subdued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules everyone and who is equally disposed toward all living entities. Let us offer our obeisances unto Him.**

### Purport

The prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, certainly controls all living entities, so much so that the living entities have forgotten the aim of life. *Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:* the living entities have forgotten that the aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead. The external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives all conditioned souls what appears to be an opportunity to be happy within this material world, but that is *māyā;* in other words, it is a dream that is never to be fulfilled. Thus every living being is illusioned by the external energy of the Supreme Lord. That illusory energy is undoubtedly very strong, but she is fully under the control of the transcendental person who is described in this verse as *pareśam,* the transcendental Lord. The Lord is not a part of the material creation, but is beyond the creation. Therefore, not only does He control the conditioned souls through His external energy, but He also controls the external energy itself. *Bhagavad-gītā* clearly says that the strong material energy controls everyone and that getting out of her control is extremely difficult. That controlling energy belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and works under His control. The living entities, however, being subdued by the material energy, have forgotten the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Since our bodies are made of sattva-guṇa, we, the demigods, are internally and externally situated in goodness. All the great saints are also situated in that way. Therefore, if even we cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are most insignificant in their bodily constitutions, being situated in the modes of passion and ignorance? How can they understand the Lord? Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.**

### Purport

Atheists and demons cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is situated within everyone. For them the Lord finally appears in the form of death, as confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham*). Atheists think that they are independent, and therefore they do not care about the supremacy of the Lord, yet the Lord asserts His supremacy when He overcomes them as death. At the time of death, their attempts to use their so-called scientific knowledge and philosophical speculation to deny the supremacy of the Lord cannot work. Hiraṇyakaśipu, for example, was an exalted representative of the atheistic class of men. He always challenged the existence of God, and thus he became inimical even toward his own son. Everyone was afraid of Hiraṇyakaśipu’s atheistic principles. Nonetheless, when Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared in order to kill him, Hiraṇyakaśipu’s atheistic principles could not save him. Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva killed Hiraṇyakaśipu and took away all his power, influence and pride. Atheistic men, however, never understand how everything they create is annihilated. The Supersoul is situated within them, but because of the predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, they cannot understand the supremacy of the Lord. Even the demigods, the devotees, who are transcendentally situated or situated on the platform of goodness, are not fully aware of the qualities and position of the Lord. How then can the demons and atheists understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead? It is not possible. Therefore, to gain this understanding, the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, offered their respectful obeisances to the Lord.

### Translation

**On this earth there are four kinds of living entities, who are all created by Him. The material creation rests on His lotus feet. He is the great Supreme Person, full of opulence and power. May He be pleased with us.**

### Purport

The word *mahī* refers to the five material elements — earth, water, air, fire and sky — which rest upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. *Mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ.* The *mahat-tattva,* the total material energy, rests on His lotus feet, for the cosmic manifestation is but another opulence of the Lord. In this cosmic manifestation there are four kinds of living entities — *jarāyu-ja* (those born from embryos), *aṇḍa-ja* (those born from eggs), *sveda-ja* (those born from perspiration), and *udbhij-ja* (those born from seeds). Everything is generated from the Lord, as confirmed in the *Vedānta-sūtra* (*janmādy asya yataḥ*). No one is independent, but the Supreme Soul is completely independent. *Janmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ.* The word *sva-rāṭ* means “independent.” We are dependent, whereas the Supreme Lord is completely independent. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the greatest of all. Even Lord Brahmā, who created the cosmic manifestation, is but another opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The material creation is activated by the Lord, and therefore the Lord is not a part of the material creation. The Lord exists in His original, spiritual position. The universal form of the Lord, *vairāja-mūrti,* is another feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**The entire cosmic manifestation has emerged from water, and it is because of water that all living entities endure, live and develop. This water is nothing but the semen of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, may the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has such great potency, be pleased with us.**

### Purport

Despite the theories of so-called scientists, the vast quantities of water on this planet and on other planets are not created by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Rather, the water is sometimes explained to be the perspiration and sometimes the semen of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is from water that all living entities emerge, and because of water they live and grow. If there were no water, all life would cease. Water is the source of life for everyone. Therefore, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have so much water all over the world.

Unfortunately, modern so-called scientists, who do not fully understand the moon, describe the moon as being full of deserts. Since the moon is the source for our vegetation, how can the moon be a desert? The moonshine is the vital force for all vegetation, and therefore we cannot possibly accept that the moon is a desert.

### Purport

The sun-god is considered to be the chief of the demigods. He is also considered to be the demigod who watches the northern side of the universe. He gives help for understanding the *Vedas.* As confirmed in *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.52):

*yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ  
rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ  
yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro

“The sun, full of infinite effulgence, is the king of all the planets and the image of the good soul. The sun is like the eye of the Supreme Lord. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, in pursuance of whose order the sun performs his journey, mounting the wheel of time.” The sun is actually the eye of the Lord. In the Vedic *mantras* it is said that unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead sees, no one can see. Unless there is sunlight, no living entity on any planet can see. Therefore the sun is considered to be the eye of the Supreme Lord. That is confirmed here by the words *yac-cakṣur āsīt* and in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* by the words *yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā.* The word *savitā* means the sun-god.

All of us follow the air for our vital force, exactly as servants follow an emperor. The vital force of air is generated from the original vital force of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. May that Supreme Lord be pleased with us.**

### Translation

**All learned men say that the five elements, eternal time, fruitive activity, the three modes of material nature, and the varieties produced by these modes are all creations of yoga-māyā. This material world is therefore extremely difficult to understand, but those who are highly learned have rejected it. May the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller of everything, be pleased with us.**

### Purport

The word *durvibhāvyam* is very important in this verse. No one can understand how everything is happening in this material world by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His material energies. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.10), *mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sacarācaram:* everything is actually happening under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This much we can learn, but how it is happening is extremely difficult to understand. We cannot even understand how the affairs within our body are systematically taking place. The body is a small universe, and since we cannot understand how things are happening in this small universe, how can we understand the affairs of the bigger universe? Actually this universe is very difficult to understand, yet learned sages have advised, as Kṛṣṇa has also advised, that this material world is *duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam;* in other words, it is a place of misery and temporality. One must give up this world and go back home, back to the Personality of Godhead. Materialists may argue, “If this material world and its affairs are impossible to understand, how can we reject it?” The answer is provided by the word *prabudhāpabādham.* We have to reject this material world because it is rejected by those who are learned in Vedic wisdom. Even though we cannot understand what this material world is, we should be ready to reject it in accordance with the advice of learned persons, especially the advice of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says:

*mām upetya punar janma  
duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam  
nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ  
saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ*

“After attaining Me, the great souls, who are *yogīs* in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.” (Bg. 8.15) One has to return home, back to Godhead, for this is the highest perfection of life. To go back to Godhead means to reject this material world. Although we cannot understand the functions of this material world and whether it is good for us or bad for us, in accordance with the advice of the supreme authority we must reject it and go back home, back to Godhead.

### Translation

**Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is completely silent, free from endeavor, and completely satisfied by His own achievements. He is not attached to the activities of the material world through His senses. Indeed, in performing His pastimes in this material world, He is just like the unattached air.**

### Purport

We can simply understand that behind the activities of material nature is the Supreme Lord, by whose indications everything takes place, although we cannot see Him. Even without seeing Him, we should offer Him our respectful obeisances. We should know that He is complete. Everything is done systematically by His energies (*parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate*), and therefore He has nothing to do (*na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate*). As indicated here by the word *upaśānta-śaktaye,* His different energies act, but although He sets these energies in action, He Himself has nothing to do. He is not attached to anything, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); *tvam* — You are my Lord; *naḥ* — to us; *darśaya* — be visible; *ātmānam* — in Your original form; *asmat*-*karaṇa*-*gocaram* — appreciable by our direct senses, especially by our eyes; *prapannānām* — we are all surrendered unto You; *didṛkṣūṇām* — yet we wish to see You; *sasmitam* — smiling; *te* — Your; *mukha*-*ambujam* — lotuslike face.

### Translation

**O Supreme Personality of Godhead, we are surrendered unto You, yet we wish to see You. Please make Your original form and smiling lotus face visible to our eyes and appreciable to our other senses.**

### Purport

The devotees are always eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form, with His smiling lotuslike face. They are not interested in experiencing the impersonal form. The Lord has both impersonal and personal features. The impersonalists have no idea of the personal feature of the Lord, but Lord Brahmā and the members of his disciplic succession want to see the Lord in His personal form. Without a personal form there can be no question of a smiling face, which is clearly indicated here by the words *sasmitam te mukhāmbujam.* Those who are in the Vaiṣṇava *sampradāya* of Brahmā always want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are eager to realize the Lord’s personal feature, not the impersonal feature. As clearly stated here, *asmat-karaṇa-gocaram:* the personal feature of the Lord can be directly perceived by our senses.

### Translation

**O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, by Your sweet will You appear in various incarnations, millennium after millennium, and act wonderfully, performing uncommon activities that would be impossible for us.**

### Purport

The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.7):

*yadā yadā hi dharmasya  
glānir bhavati bhārata  
abhyutthānam adharmasya  
tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham*

“Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time I descend Myself.” Thus it is not an imagination but a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His sweet will, appears in different incarnations, such as Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Nṛsiṁha, Vāmana, Paraśurāma, Rāmacandra, Balarāma, Buddha and many other forms. Devotees are always eager to see one of the Lord’s innumerable forms. It is said that just as no one can count how many waves there are in the sea, no one can count the forms of the Lord. This does not mean, however, that anyone can claim to be a form of the Lord and be acceptable as an incarnation. The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be accepted in terms of the descriptions found in the *śāstras.* Lord Brahmā is eager to see the incarnation of the Lord, or the original source of all incarnations; he is not eager to see an imposter. The incarnation’s activities are proof of His identity. All the incarnations described in the *śāstras* act wonderfully (*keśava dhṛta-mīna-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare*). It is only by the personal sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that He appears and disappears, and only fortunate devotees can expect to see Him face to face.

### Translation

**Karmīs are always anxious to accumulate wealth for their sense gratification, but for that purpose they must work very hard. Yet even though they work hard, the results are not satisfying. Indeed, sometimes their work results only in frustration. But devotees who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Lord can achieve substantial results without working very hard. These results exceed the devotee’s expectations.**

### Purport

We can practically see how the devotees who have dedicated their lives for the service of the Lord in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are getting immense opportunities for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without working very hard. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement actually started with only forty rupees, but now it has more than forty crores worth of property, and all this opulence has been achieved within eight or ten years. No *karmī* can expect to improve his business so swiftly, and besides that, whatever a *karmī* acquires is temporary and sometimes frustrating. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, everything is encouraging and improving. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not very popular with the *karmīs* because this movement recommends that one refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. These are restrictions that *karmīs* very much dislike. Nonetheless, in the presence of so many enemies, this movement is progressing, going forward without impediments. If the devotees continue to spread this movement, dedicating life and soul to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, no one will be able to check it. The movement will go forward without limits. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa!

### Translation

**Activities dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if performed in small measure, never go in vain. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the supreme father, is naturally very dear and always ready to act for the good of the living entities.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.40), the Lord says *svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt:* this *dharma,* devotional service, is so important that even if performed to a very small, almost negligible extent, it can give one the supreme result. There are many instances in the history of the world in which even a slight service rendered to the Lord has saved a living entity from the greatest danger. Ajāmila, for example, was saved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the greatest danger, that of going to hell. He was saved simply because he chanted the name Nārāyaṇa at the end of his life. When Ajāmila chanted this holy name of the Lord, Nārāyaṇa, he did not chant knowingly; actually he was calling his youngest son, whose name was Nārāyaṇa. Nonetheless, Lord Nārāyaṇa took this chanting seriously, and thus Ajāmila achieved the result of *ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ,* remembering Nārāyaṇa at the end of life. If one somehow or other remembers the holy name of Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa or Rāma at the end of life, he immediately achieves the transcendental result of going back home, back to Godhead.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the only object of our love. As long as we are in this material world we have so many desires to fulfill, but when we come in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we immediately become perfect and fully satisfied, just as a child is fully satisfied when he comes to the lap of his mother. Dhruva Mahārāja went to the forest to achieve some material result by austerity and penance, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, “I do not want any material benediction. I am completely satisfied.” Even if one wants some material benefit from serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this can be achieved extremely easily, without hard labor. Therefore the *śāstra* recommends:

*akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā  
mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ  
tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena  
yajeta puruṣaṁ param*

“Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service.” (*Bhāg.* 2.3.10) Even if one has material desires, one can undoubtedly achieve what he wants by rendering service to the Lord.

### Translation

**When one pours water on the root of a tree, the trunk and branches of the tree are automatically pleased. Similarly, when one becomes a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, everyone is served, for the Lord is the Supersoul of everyone.**

### Purport

As stated in the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ  
viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param  
tasmāt parataraṁ devi  
tadīyānāṁ samarcanam*

“Of all types of worship, worship of Lord Viṣṇu is best, and better than the worship of Lord Viṣṇu is the worship of His devotee, the Vaiṣṇava.” There are many demigods worshiped by people who are attached to material desires (*kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ*). Because people are embarrassed by so many material desires, they worship Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, the goddess Kālī, Durgā, Gaṇeśa and Sūrya to achieve different results. However, one can achieve all these results simultaneously just by worshiping Lord Viṣṇu. As stated elsewhere in the *Bhāgavatam* (4.31.14):

*yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena  
tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ  
prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ  
tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā*

“Just by pouring water on the root of a tree, one nourishes its trunk and all of its branches, fruits and flowers, and just by supplying food to the stomach, one satisfies all the limbs of the body. Similarly, by worshiping Lord Viṣṇu one can satisfy everyone.” Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a sectarian religious movement. Rather, it is meant for all-embracing welfare activities for the world. One can enter this movement without discrimination in terms of caste, creed, religion or nationality. If one is trained to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, who is the origin of *viṣṇu-tattva,* one can become fully satisfied and perfect in all respects.

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the material activities manifested by the three modes of material nature. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *nirguṇaṁ guṇa-bhoktṛ ca:* the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to the material qualities (*sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa*), but nonetheless He is their controller. The Lord manifests Himself in three features — as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara — to control these three qualities. He personally takes charge of *sattva-guṇa* as Lord Viṣṇu, and He entrusts the charge of *rajo-guṇa* and *tamo-guṇa* to Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Ultimately, however, He is the controller of all three *guṇas.* Lord Brahmā, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord Viṣṇu had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would be successful in fulfilling their desires. The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested with *tamo-guṇa.* However, as Lord Brahmā has previously described, since the time of *sattva-guṇa* had now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires. The demigods are supposedly well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as *anantāya.* Although Lord Brahmā knows past, present and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Demigods Appeal to the Lord for Protection.”*
