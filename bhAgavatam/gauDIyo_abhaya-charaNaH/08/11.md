CHAPTER ELEVEN

As described in this chapter, the great saint Nārada Muni, being very compassionate to the demons who had been killed by the demigods, forbade the demigods to continue killing. Then Śukrācārya, by his mystic power, renewed the lives of all the demons.

Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons again, with renewed energy. King Indra released his thunderbolt against Bali, and when Bali fell, his friend Jambhāsura attacked Indra, who then cut off Jambhāsura’s head with his thunderbolt. When Nārada Muni learned that Jambhāsura had been killed, he informed Jambhāsura’s relatives Namuci, Bala and Pāka, who then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods. Indra, King of heaven, severed the heads of Bala and Pāka and released the weapon known as *kuliśa,* the thunderbolt, against Namuci’s shoulder. The thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus Indra became morose. At that time, an unseen voice came from the sky. The voice declared, “A dry or wet weapon cannot kill Namuci.” Hearing this voice, Indra began to think of how Namuci could be killed. He then thought of foam, which is neither moist nor dry. Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill Namuci. Thus Indra and the other demigods killed many demons. Then, at the request of Lord Brahmā, Nārada went to the demigods and forbade them to kill the demons any longer. All the demigods then returned to their abodes. Following the instructions of Nārada, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took Bali Mahārāja to Asta Mountain. There, by the touch of Śukrācārya’s hand, Bali Mahārāja regained his senses and consciousness, and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the mystic power of Śukrācārya.

### Verse text

*ārurukṣanti māyābhir  
utsisṛpsanti ye divam  
tān dasyūn vidhunomy ajñān  
pūrvasmāc ca padād adhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*ārurukṣanti* — persons who desire to come to the upper planetary systems; *māyābhiḥ* — by so-called mystic power or material advancement of science; *utsisṛpsanti* — or want to be liberated by such false attempts; *ye* — such persons who; *divam* — the higher planetary system known as Svargaloka; *tān* — such rogues and ruffians; *dasyūn* — such thieves; *vidhunomi* — I force to go down; *ajñān* — rascals; *pūrvasmāt* — previous; *ca* — also; *padāt* — from the position; *adhaḥ* — downward.

### Translation

### Purport

There are undoubtedly different planetary systems for different persons. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.18), *ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ:* persons in the mode of goodness can go to the upper planets. Those in the modes of darkness and passion, however, are not allowed to enter the higher planets. The word *divam* refers to the higher planetary system known as Svargaloka. Indra, King of the higher planetary system, has the power to push down any conditioned soul attempting to go from the lower to the higher planets without proper qualifications. The modern attempt to go to the moon is also an attempt by inferior men to go to Svargaloka by artificial, mechanical means. This attempt cannot be successful. From this statement of Indra it appears that anyone attempting to go to the higher planetary systems by mechanical means, which are here called *māyā,* is condemned to go to the hellish planets in the lower portion of the universe. To go to the higher planetary system, one needs sufficient good qualities. A sinful person situated in the mode of ignorance and addicted to drinking, meat-eating and illicit sex will never enter the higher planets by mechanical means.

सङ्ग्रामे वर्तमानानां कालचोदितकर्मणाम् ।  
कीर्तिर्जयोऽजयो मृत्यु- सर्वेषां स्युरनुक्रमात् ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-balir uvāca  
*saṅgrāme vartamānānāṁ  
kāla-codita-karmaṇām  
kīrtir jayo ’jayo mṛtyuḥ  
sarveṣāṁ syur anukramāt*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*baliḥ* *uvāca* — Bali Mahārāja said; *saṅgrāme* — in the battlefield; *vartamānānām* — of all persons present here; *kāla*-*codita* — influenced by the course of time; *karmaṇām* — for persons engaged in fighting or any other activities; *kīrtiḥ* — reputation; *jayaḥ* — victory; *ajayaḥ* — defeat; *mṛtyuḥ* — death; *sarveṣām* — of all of them; *syuḥ* — must be done; *anukramāt* — one after another.

### Translation

**Bali Mahārāja replied: All those present on this battlefield are certainly under the influence of eternal time, and according to their prescribed activities, they are destined to receive fame, victory, defeat and death, one after another.**

### Purport

If one is victorious on the battlefield, he becomes famous; and if one is not victorious but is defeated, he may die. Both victory and defeat are possible, whether on such a battlefield as this or on the battlefield of the struggle for existence. Everything takes place according to the laws of nature (*prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ*). Since everyone, without exception, is subject to the modes of material nature, whether one is victorious or defeated he is not independent, but is under the control of material nature. Bali Mahārāja, therefore, was very sensible. He knew that the fighting was arranged by eternal time and that under time’s influence one must accept the results of one’s own activities. Therefore even though Indra threatened that he would now kill Bali Mahārāja by releasing the thunderbolt, Bali Mahārāja was not at all afraid. This is the spirit of a *kṣatriya:* *yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam* (Bg. 18.43). A *kṣatriya* must be tolerant in all circumstances, especially on the battlefield. Thus Bali Mahārāja asserted that he was not at all afraid of death, although he was threatened by such a great personality as the King of heaven.

तदिदं कालरशनं जगत् पश्यन्ति सूरय- ।  
न हृष्यन्ति न शोचन्ति तत्र यूयमपण्डिता- ॥ ८ ॥

### Verse text

*tad idaṁ kāla-raśanaṁ  
jagat paśyanti sūrayaḥ  
na hṛṣyanti na śocanti  
tatra yūyam apaṇḍitāḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat* — therefore; *idam* — this whole material world; *kāla*-*raśanam* — is moving because of time eternal; *jagat* — moving forward (this whole universe); *paśyanti* — observe; *sūrayaḥ* — those who are intelligent by admission of the truth; *na* — not; *hṛṣyanti* — become jubilant; *na* — nor; *śocanti* — lament; *tatra* — in such; *yūyam* — all of you demigods; *apaṇḍitāḥ* — not very learned (having forgotten that you are working under eternal time).

### Translation

**Seeing the movements of time, those who are cognizant of the real truth neither rejoice nor lament for different circumstances. Therefore, because you are jubilant due to your victory, you should be considered not very learned.**

### Purport

Bali Mahārāja knew that Indra, King of heaven, was extremely powerful, certainly more powerful than he himself. Nonetheless, Bali Mahārāja challenged Indra by saying that Indra was not a very learned person. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.11) Kṛṣṇa rebuked Arjuna by saying:

*aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ  
prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase  
gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca  
nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ*

“While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.” Thus as Kṛṣṇa challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a *paṇḍita,* or a learned person, Bali Mahārāja also challenged King Indra and his associates. In this material world, everything happens under the influence of time. Consequently, for a learned person who sees how things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material nature. After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of nature’s activities. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.14), Kṛṣṇa advises that one be tolerant: *tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata*. Following this advice of Kṛṣṇa’s, one should not be morose or unhappy because of circumstantial changes. This is the symptom of a devotee. A devotee carries out his duty in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is never unhappy in awkward circumstances. He has full faith that in such circumstances, Kṛṣṇa protects His devotee. Therefore a devotee never deviates from his prescribed duty of devotional service. The material qualities of jubilation and moroseness are present even in the demigods, who are very highly situated in the upper planetary system. Therefore, when one is undisturbed by the so-called favorable and unfavorable circumstances of this material world, he should be understood to be *brahma-bhūta,* or self-realized. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54), *brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati:* “One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.” When one is undisturbed by material circumstances, he should be understood to be on the transcendental stage, above the reactions of the three modes of material nature.

### Translation

**You demigods think that your own selves are the cause of your attaining fame and victory. Because of your ignorance, saintly persons feel sorry for you. Therefore, although your words afflict the heart, we do not accept them.**

From this statement it appears that in the upper planetary system there is shipping and that traders there engage in navigation as their occupational duty. Sometimes, as on this planet, these traders are shipwrecked in the middle of the ocean. It appears that even in the upper planetary system, such calamities occasionally take place. The upper planetary system in the creation of the Lord is certainly not vacant or devoid of living entities. From *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* we understand that every planet is full of living entities, just as earth is. There is no reason to accept that on other planetary systems there are no living beings.

### Translation

### Purport

It is significant that Bali Mahārāja is here said to be very experienced. Although defeated, he was not at all sorry, for he knew that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since he was a devotee, he accepted his defeat without lamentation. As stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.47), *karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana.* Everyone in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should execute his duty, without regard for victory or defeat. One must execute his duty as ordered by Kṛṣṇa or His representative, the spiritual master. *Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā*. In first-class devotional service, one always abides by the orders and will of Kṛṣṇa.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “King Indra Annihilates the Demons.”*
