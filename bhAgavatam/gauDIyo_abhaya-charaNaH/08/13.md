### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.3) it is stated, *manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye:* out of many millions of people, one may attempt to achieve success in life. This success is explained here. *Rāddham indra-padaṁ hitvā tataḥ siddhim avāpsyati.* *Siddhi* consists of achieving the favor of Lord Viṣṇu, not the *yoga-siddhis.* The *yoga-siddhis — aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, vaśitva* and *kāmāvasāyitā* — are temporary. The ultimate *siddhi* is to achieve the favor of Lord Viṣṇu.
