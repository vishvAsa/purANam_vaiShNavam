CHAPTER THIRTEEN

This chapter describes Indra’s fear at having killed a *brāhmaṇa* (Vṛtrāsura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Viṣṇu.

When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vṛtrāsura, he refused because Vṛtrāsura was a *brāhmaṇa.* The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the Nārāyaṇa-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Nārāyaṇa. Even by a glimpse of the chanting of Nārāyaṇa’s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a *brāhmaṇa.* The demigods advised Indra to perform an *aśvamedha* sacrifice, by which Nārāyaṇa would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.

Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vṛtrāsura, but when Vṛtrāsura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vṛtrāsura’s position. This is the nature of a great personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a *brāhmaṇa.* Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to Mānasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahuṣa reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra’s wife, Śacīdevī, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted *brāhmaṇas* and saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a *brāhmaṇa.*

While departing, however, no one spoke to Indra.**

### Purport

In this connection Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments:

*brahmeśendrādaya iti; indrasya sva-dhiṣṇya-gamanaṁ nopapadyate vṛtra-vadha-kṣaṇa eva brahma-hatyopadrava-prāpteḥ; tasmāt tata ity anena mānasa-sarovarād āgatya pravartitād aśvamedhāt parata iti vyākhyeyam.*

Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the other demigods returned to their respective abodes, but Indra did not, for he was disturbed at having killed Vṛtrāsura, who was actually a *brāhmaṇa.* After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra went to the Mānasa-sarovara Lake to become free from sinful reactions. When he left the lake, he performed an *aśvamedha-yajña* and then returned to his own abode.

### Translation

**Mahārāja Parīkṣit inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī: O great sage, what was the reason for Indra’s unhappiness? I wish to hear about this. When he killed Vṛtrāsura, all the demigods were extremely happy. Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?**

### Purport

This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vṛtrāsura’s having been killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and *brāhmaṇa.* Vṛtrāsura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great *brāhmaṇa.*

Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahlāda Mahārāja and Bali Mahārāja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Vṛtrāsura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vṛtrāsura was transferred to Vaikuṇṭhaloka to become an associate of Saṅkarṣaṇa. Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaiṣṇava or *brāhmaṇa.*

A Vaiṣṇava is already a *brāhmaṇa,* although a *brāhmaṇa* may not be a Vaiṣṇava. The *Padma Purāṇa* says:

*ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro  
mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ  
avaiṣṇavo gurur na syād  
vaiṣṇavaḥ śva-paco guruḥ*

One may be a *brāhmaṇa* in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge (*mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ*), but if he is not a Vaiṣṇava, he cannot be a *guru.* This means that an expert *brāhmaṇa* may not be a Vaiṣṇava, but a Vaiṣṇava is already a *brāhmaṇa.* A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire. Vṛtrāsura was a perfect Vaiṣṇava, and therefore he was also a *brāhmaṇa.*

### Translation

**One who has killed a brāhmaṇa, one who has killed a cow or one who has killed his father, mother or spiritual master can be immediately freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Other sinful persons, such as dog-eaters and caṇḍālas, who are less than śūdras, can also be freed in this way. But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by performing the great horse sacrifice. If you please Lord Nārāyaṇa in that way, why should you be afraid? You will be freed even if you kill the entire universe, including the brāhmaṇas, not to speak of killing a disturbing demon like Vṛtrāsura.**

### Purport

It is said in the *Bṛhad-viṣṇu Purāṇa:*

*nāmno hi yāvatī śaktiḥ  
pāpa-nirharaṇe hareḥ  
tāvat kartuṁ na śaknoti  
pātakaṁ pātakī naraḥ*

Also, in the *Prema-vivarta* by Jagadānanda Paṇḍita it is said:

*eka kṛṣṇa-nāme pāpīra yata pāpa-kṣaya  
bahu janme sei pāpī karite nāraya*

This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine performing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. *Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ:* the Lord’s holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned.

These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds. In the *Manu-saṁhitā* the following names are given. A son begotten by a *brāhmaṇa* and born from the womb of a *śūdra* mother is called a *pāraśava* or *niṣāda,* a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a *niṣāda* in the womb of a *śūdra* woman is called a *pukkasa.* A child begotten by a *kṣatriya* in the womb of the daughter of a *śūdra* is called an *ugra.* A child begotten by a *śūdra* in the womb of the daughter of a *kṣatriya* is called a *kṣattā.* A child begotten by a *kṣatriya* in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a *śvāda,* or dog-eater. All such offspring are considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra.*

The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement offers everyone a chance to be purified, regardless of birth or family. As confirmed in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.4.18):

*kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā  
ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ  
ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ  
śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ*

“Kirātas, Hūṇas, Āndhras, Pulindas, Pulkaśas, Ābhīras, Śumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.” Even such sinful persons can certainly all be purified if they chant the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee.

Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill Vṛtrāsura even at the risk of *brahma-hatyā,* the killing of a *brāhmaṇa,* and they guarantee to release him from sinful reactions by performing an *aśvamedha-yajña.* Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the performer of sinful acts. This will be seen from the following verse.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Encouraged by the words of the sages, Indra killed Vṛtrāsura, and when he was killed the sinful reaction for killing a brāhmaṇa \[brahma-hatyā\] certainly took shelter of Indra.**

### Purport

After killing Vṛtrāsura, Indra could not surpass the *brahma-hatyā,* the sinful reactions for killing a *brāhmaṇa.* Formerly he had killed one *brāhmaṇa,* Viśvarūpa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time, following the advice of the sages, he killed another *brāhmaṇa* purposely. Therefore the sinful reaction was greater than before. Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for atonement. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering, the *brāhmaṇas* allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing *prāyaścitta,* atonement, cannot give relief to anyone, even to Indra or Nahuṣa. Nahuṣa was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.

### Translation

**Following the advice of the demigods, Indra killed Vṛtrāsura, and he suffered because of this sinful killing. Although the other demigods were happy, he could not derive happiness from the killing of Vṛtrāsura. Indra’s other good qualities, such as tolerance and opulence, could not help him in his grief.**

### Purport

One cannot be happy by committing sinful acts, even if one is endowed with material opulence. Indra found this to be true. People began to blaspheme him, saying, “This person has killed a *brāhmaṇa* for the sake of enjoying heavenly material happiness.” Therefore in spite of being King of heaven and enjoying material opulence, Indra was always unhappy because of the accusations of the populace.

Because she was afflicted with tuberculosis, her body and garments were covered with blood. Breathing an unbearable fishy odor that polluted the entire street, she called to Indra, “Wait! Wait!”**

### Purport

When a person is afflicted with tuberculosis, he often vomits blood, which makes his garments bloody.
