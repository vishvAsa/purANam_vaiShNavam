CHAPTER NINETEEN

This chapter explains how Diti, Kaśyapa Muni’s wife, executed Kaśyapa Muni’s instructions on devotional service. During the first day of the bright fortnight of the moon in the month of Agrahāyaṇa (November-December), every woman, following in the footsteps of Diti and following the instructions of her own husband, should begin this *puṁsavana-vrata.* In the morning, after washing her teeth, bathing and thus becoming purified, she should hear about the birth mystery of the Maruts. Then, covering her body with a white dress and being properly ornamented, before breakfast she should worship Lord Viṣṇu and mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, Lord Viṣṇu’s wife, by glorifying Lord Viṣṇu for His mercy, patience, prowess, ability, greatness and other glories and for how He can bestow all mystic benedictions. While offering the Lord all paraphernalia for worship, such as ornaments, a sacred thread, scents, nice flowers, incense and water for bathing and washing His feet, hands and mouth, one should invite the Lord with this *mantra:* *oṁ namo bhagavate mahā-puruṣāya mahānubhāvāya mahāvibhūtipataye saha mahā-vibhūtibhir balim upaharāmi.* Then one should offer twelve oblations in the fire while chanting this *mantra:* *oṁ namo bhagavate mahā-puruṣāya mahāvibhūti-pataye svāhā.* One should offer obeisances while chanting this *mantra* ten times. Then one should chant the Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa *mantra.*

If either a pregnant woman or her husband regularly discharges this devotional service, both of them will receive the result. After continuing this process for one full year, the chaste wife should fast on the *pūrṇimā,* the full-moon day, of Kārttika. On the following day, the husband should worship the Lord as before and then observe a festival by cooking nice food and distributing *prasāda* to the *brāhmaṇas.* Then, with the permission of the *brāhmaṇas,* the husband and wife should take *prasāda.* This chapter ends by glorifying the results of the *puṁsavana* function.

### Devanagari

अलं ते निरपेक्षाय पूर्णकाम नमोऽस्तु ते ।  
महाविभूतिपतये नम- सकलसिद्धये ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*alaṁ te nirapekṣāya  
pūrṇa-kāma namo ’stu te  
mahāvibhūti-pataye  
namaḥ sakala-siddhaye*

### Synonyms

*alam* — enough; *te* — to You; *nirapekṣāya* — indifferent; *pūrṇa*-*kāma* — O Lord, whose desire is always fulfilled; *namaḥ* — obeisances; *astu* — may there be; *te* — unto You; *mahā*-*vibhūti* — of Lakṣmī; *pataye* — unto the husband; *namaḥ* — obeisances; *sakala*-*siddhaye* — unto the master of all mystic perfections.

### Translation

**\[She should then pray to the Lord as follows.\] My dear Lord, You are full in all opulences, but I do not beg You for opulence. I simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the husband and master of Lakṣmīdevī, the goddess of fortune, who has all opulences. Therefore You are the master of all mystic yoga. I simply offer my obeisances unto You.**

### Purport

A devotee knows how to appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

*oṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idaṁ  
pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate  
pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya  
pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate*

“The Personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes. Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance.” Therefore, to take shelter of the Supreme Lord is required. Whatever a devotee needs will be supplied by the complete Supreme Personality of Godhead (*teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham*). Therefore a pure devotee will not ask anything from the Lord. He simply offers the Lord his respectful obeisances, and the Lord is prepared to accept whatever the devotee can secure to worship Him, even *patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam*a leaf, flower, fruit or water. There is no need to artificially exert oneself. It is better to be plain and simple and with respectful obeisances offer to the Lord whatever one can secure. The Lord is completely able to bless the devotee with all opulences.

### Verse text

*yathā tvaṁ kṛpayā bhūtyā  
tejasā mahimaujasā  
juṣṭa īśa guṇaiḥ sarvais  
tato ’si bhagavān prabhuḥ*

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *tvam* — You; *kṛpayā* — with mercy; *bhūtyā* — with opulences; *tejasā* — with prowess; *mahima*-*ojasā* — with glory and strength; *juṣṭaḥ* — endowed; *īśa* — O my Lord; *guṇaiḥ* — with transcendental qualities; *sarvaiḥ* — all; *tataḥ* — therefore; *asi* — You are; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *prabhuḥ* — the master.

### Translation

**O my Lord, because You are endowed with causeless mercy, all opulences, all prowess and all glories, strength and transcendental qualities, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everyone.**

### Purport

In this verse the words *tato ’si bhagavān prabhuḥ* mean “Therefore You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everyone.” The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all six opulences in full, and moreover He is extremely kind to His devotee. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service. Thus He becomes satisfied. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His devotee offers Him *patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam* — a leaf, flower, fruit or water — in devotion. Sometimes the Lord, as the child of mother Yaśodā, requests His devotee for some food, as if He were very hungry. Sometimes He tells His devotee in a dream that His temple and His garden are now very old and that He cannot enjoy them very nicely. Thus He requests the devotee to repair them. Sometimes He is buried in the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him. Sometimes He requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to perform this task. Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees. Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is extremely confidential. Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on His devotee for some particular work. This is explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (11.33), where the Lord tells Arjuna, *nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin:* “O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight.” Lord Kṛṣṇa had the competence to win the Battle of Kurukṣetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to fight and become the cause of victory. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was quite competent enough to spread His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work. Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord’s self-sufficiency is that He depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy. The devotee who has perceived this causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant.

### Devanagari

विष्णुपत्नि महामाये महापुरुषलक्षणे ।  
प्रीयेथा मे महाभागे लोकमातर्नमोऽस्तु ते ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*viṣṇu-patni mahā-māye  
mahāpuruṣa-lakṣaṇe  
prīyethā me mahā-bhāge  
loka-mātar namo ’stu te*

### Synonyms

*viṣṇu*-*patni* — O wife of Lord Viṣṇu; *mahā*-*māye* — O energy of Lord Viṣṇu; *mahā*-*puruṣa*-*lakṣaṇe* — possessing the qualities and opulences of Lord Viṣṇu; *prīyethāḥ* — kindly be pleased; *me* — upon me; *mahā*-*bhāge* — O goddess of fortune; *loka*-*mātaḥ* — O mother of the world; *namaḥ* — obeisances; *astu* — may there be; *te* — unto you.

### Translation

**\[After profusely offering obeisances unto Lord Viṣṇu, the devotee should offer respectful obeisances unto mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, and pray as follows.\] O wife of Lord Viṣṇu, O internal energy of Lord Viṣṇu, you are as good as Lord Viṣṇu Himself, for you have all of His qualities and opulences. O goddess of fortune, please be kind to me. O mother of the entire world, I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.**

### Purport

The Lord has multifarious potencies (*parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate*). Since mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is the Lord’s very precious potency, she is addressed here as *mahā-māye.* The word *māyā* means *śakti.* Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme, cannot exhibit His power everywhere without His principal energy. It is said, *śakti śaktimān abheda:* the power and the powerful are identical. Therefore mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is the constant companion of Lord Viṣṇu; they remain together constantly. One cannot keep Lakṣmī in one’s home without Lord Viṣṇu. To think that one can do so is very dangerous. To keep Lakṣmī, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always dangerous, for then Lakṣmī becomes the illusory energy. With Lord Viṣṇu, however, Lakṣmī is the spiritual energy.

O husband of mother Lakṣmī, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are accompanied by many associates, such as Viśvaksena. I offer all the paraphernalia for worshiping You.” One should chant this mantra every day with great attention while worshiping Lord Viṣṇu with all paraphernalia, such as water for washing His feet, hands and mouth and water for His bath. One must offer Him various presentations for His worship, such as garments, a sacred thread, ornaments, scents, flowers, incense and lamps.**

*śriyaṁ viṣṇuṁ ca varadāv  
āśiṣāṁ prabhavāv ubhau  
bhaktyā sampūjayen nityaṁ  
yadīcchet sarva-sampadaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śriyam* — the goddess of fortune; *viṣṇum* — Lord Viṣṇu; *ca* — and; *vara*-*dau* — the bestowers of benedictions; *āśiṣām* — of blessings; *prabhavau* — the sources; *ubhau* — both; *bhaktyā* — with devotion; *sampūjayet* — should worship; *nityam* — daily; *yadi* — if; *icchet* — desires; *sarva* — all; *sampadaḥ* — opulences.

### Translation

**If one desires all opulences, his duty is to daily worship Lord Viṣṇu with His wife, Lakṣmī. With great devotion one should worship Him according to the above-mentioned process. Lord Viṣṇu and the goddess of fortune are an immensely powerful combination. They are the bestowers of all benedictions and the sources of all good fortune. Therefore the duty of everyone is to worship Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa.**

### Purport

Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa — Lord Viṣṇu and mother Lakṣmī — are always situated in everyone’s heart (*īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe ’rjuna tiṣṭhati*). However, because nondevotees do not realize that Lord Viṣṇu stays with His eternal consort, Lakṣmī, within the hearts of all living entities, they are not endowed with the opulence of Lord Viṣṇu. Unscrupulous men sometimes address a poor man as *daridra-nārāyaṇa,* or “poor Nārāyaṇa.” This is most unscientific. Lord Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī are always situated in everyone’s heart, but this does not mean that everyone is Nārāyaṇa, especially not those in poverty. This is a most abominable term to use in connection with Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa never becomes poor, and therefore He can never be called *daridra-nārāyaṇa.* Nārāyaṇa is certainly situated in everyone’s heart, but He is neither poor nor rich. Only unscrupulous persons who do not know the opulence of Nārāyaṇa try to afflict Him with poverty.

She also has a holy name and form, whereas You are the support of all such names and forms and the cause for their manifestation.**

### Purport

Madhvācārya, the *ācārya* of the Tattvavādīs, has described this verse in the following way: “Viṣṇu is described as *yajña* personified, and mother Lakṣmī is described as spiritual activities and the original form of worship. In fact, they represent spiritual activities and the Supersoul of all *yajña.* Lord Viṣṇu is the Supersoul even of Lakṣmīdevī, but no one can be the Supersoul of Lord Viṣṇu, for Lord Viṣṇu Himself is the spiritual Supersoul of everyone.”

According to Madhvācārya, there are two *tattvas,* or factors. One is independent, and the other is dependent. The first *tattva* is the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, and the second is the *jīva-tattva.* Lakṣmīdevī, being dependent on Lord Viṣṇu, is sometimes counted among the *jīvas.* The Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, however, describe Lakṣmīdevī in accordance with the following two verses from the *Prameya-ratnāvalī* of Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. The first verse is a quotation from the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa.*

*nityaiva sā jagan-mātā  
viṣṇoḥ śrīr anapāyinī  
yathā sarva-gato viṣṇus  
tathaiveyaṁ dvijottama*

*viṣṇoḥ syuḥ śaktayas tisras  
tāsu yā kīrtitā parā  
saiva śrīs tad-abhinneti  
prāha śiṣyān prabhur mahān*

“O best of the *brāhmaṇas,* Lakṣmījī is the constant companion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, and therefore she is called *anapāyinī.* She is the mother of all creation. As Lord Viṣṇu is all-pervading, His spiritual potency, mother Lakṣmī, is also all-pervading. Lord Viṣṇu has three principal potencies — internal, external and marginal. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has accepted *parā-śakti,* the spiritual energy of the Lord, as being identical with the Lord. Thus she is also included in the independent *viṣṇu-tattva.*”

In the *Kānti-mālā* commentary on the *Prameya-ratnāvalī* there is this statement: *nanu kvacit nitya-mukta jīvatvaṁ lakṣmyāḥ svīkṛtaṁ, tatrāha-prāheti;* *nityaiveti padye sarva-vyāpti-kathanena kalākāṣṭhety ādi-padya-dvaye, śuddho ’pīty uktā ca mahāprabhunā svaśiṣyān prati lakṣmyā bhagavad-advaitam upadiṣṭam; kvacid yat tasyās tu dvaitam uktaṁ, tat tu tad-āviṣṭa-nitya-mukta jīvam ādāya saṅgatamas tu.* “Although some authoritative Vaiṣṇava disciplic successions count the goddess of fortune among the ever-liberated living entities (*jīvas*) in Vaikuṇṭha, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in accordance with the statement in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa,* has described Lakṣmī as being identical with the *viṣṇu-tattva.* The correct conclusion is that the descriptions of Lakṣmī as being different from Viṣṇu are stated when an eternally liberated living entity is imbued with the quality of Lakṣmī; they do not pertain to mother Lakṣmī, the eternal consort of Lord Viṣṇu.”

If one recites this narration while offering oblations to the pitās and demigods, especially during the śrāddha ceremony, the demigods and inhabitants of Pitṛloka will be extremely pleased with him and bestow upon him the fulfillment of all desires. After one performs this ritualistic ceremony, Lord Viṣṇu and His wife, mother Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, are very pleased with him. O King Parīkṣit, now I have completely described how Diti performed this ceremony and had good children — the Maruts — and a happy life. I have tried to explain this to you as elaborately as possible.**
