CHAPTER EIGHT

This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious over the soldiers of the demons, and it also describes the shield of the Viṣṇu *mantra.*

To take protection from this shield, one must first touch *kuśa* grass and wash one’s mouth with *ācamana-mantras.* One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Viṣṇu *mantra* on the parts of his body and place the twelve-syllable *mantra* on his hands. The eight-syllable *mantra* is *oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya.* This *mantra* should be distributed all over the front and back of the body. The twelve-syllable *mantra,* which begins with the *praṇava, oṁkāra,* is *oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.* One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the *praṇava, oṁkāra.* Thereafter, one must chant *oṁ viṣṇave namaḥ,* which is a six-syllable *mantra.* One must progressively place the syllables of the *mantra* on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the *śikhā* and between the eyes, and then one should chant *maḥ astrāya phaṭ* and with this *mantra* protect himself from all directions. *Nādevo devam arcayet:* one who has not risen to the level of a *deva* cannot chant this *mantra.* According to this direction of the *śāstra,* one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme.

After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-armed Lord Viṣṇu, who sits on the shoulders of Garuḍadeva. One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vāmana, Kūrma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, Paraśurāma, Rāmacandra (the elder brother of Lakṣmaṇa), Nara-Nārāyaṇa, Dattātreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumāra, Hayagrīva, Nāradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee), Dhanvantari, Ṛṣabhadeva, Yajña, Balarāma, Vyāsadeva, Buddhadeva and Keśava. One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vṛndāvana, and one should think of Nārāyaṇa, the master of the spiritual sky. One should think of Madhusūdana, Tridhāmā, Mādhava, Hṛṣīkeśa, Padmanābha, Janārdana, Dāmodara and Viśveśvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa Himself. After offering prayers to the Lord’s personal expansions known as the *svāṁśa* and *śaktyāveśa-avatāras,* one should pray to the weapons of Lord Nārāyaṇa, such as the Sudarśana, *gadā, śaṅkha, khaḍga* and bow.

After explaining this process, Śukadeva Gosvāmī told Mahārāja Parīkṣit how Viśvarūpa, the brother of Vṛtrāsura, described the glories of the Nārāyaṇa-kavaca to Indra.

Then one should touch kuśa grass and sit gravely and silently, facing north. When completely purified, one should touch the mantra composed of eight syllables to the eight parts of his body and touch the mantra composed of twelve syllables to his hands. Thus, in the following manner, he should bind himself with the Nārāyaṇa coat of armor. First, while chanting the mantra composed of eight syllables \[oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya\], beginning with the praṇava, the syllable om, one should touch his hands to eight parts of his body, starting with the two feet and progressing systematically to the knees, thighs, abdomen, heart, chest, mouth and head. Then one should chant the mantra in reverse, beginning from the last syllable \[ya\], while touching the parts of his body in the reverse order. These two processes are known as utpatti-nyāsa and saṁhāra-nyāsa respectively.**

Thereafter, adding visarga to the final syllable ma he should chant the mantra maḥ astrāya phaṭ in all directions, beginning from the east.

### Purport

Thinking oneself one with the Supreme is called *ahaṅgrahopāsanā.* Through *ahaṅgrahopāsanā* one does not become God, but he thinks of himself as qualitatively one with the Supreme. Understanding that as a spirit soul he is equal in quality to the supreme soul the way the water of a river is of the same nature as the water of the sea, one should meditate upon the Supreme Lord, as described in this verse, and seek His protection. The living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme. Consequently their duty is to always seek the mercy of the Lord in order to be protected by Him in all circumstances.

### Purport

Lusty desires are very strong in everyone, and they are the greatest impediment to the discharge of devotional service. Therefore those who are very much influenced by lusty desires are advised to take shelter of Sanat-kumāra, the great *brahmacārī* devotee. Nārada Muni, who is the guide for *arcana,* is the author of the *Nārada-pañcarātra,* which prescribes the regulative principles for worshiping the Deity. Everyone engaged in Deity worship, whether at home or in the temple, should always seek the mercy of Devarṣi Nārada in order to avoid the thirty-two offenses while worshiping the Deity. These offenses in Deity worship are mentioned in *The Nectar of Devotion.*

May Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, who conquered His inner and outer senses, protect me from fear produced by the duality of heat and cold. May Yajña protect me from defamation and harm from the populace, and may Lord Balarāma as Śeṣa protect me from envious serpents.**

### Purport

To live within this material world, one must face many dangers, as described herein. For example, undesirable food poses a danger to health, and therefore one must give up such food. The Dhanvantari incarnation can protect us in this regard. Since Lord Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all living entities, if He likes He can save us from *adhibhautika* disturbances, disturbances from other living entities. Lord Balarāma is the Śeṣa incarnation, and therefore He can save us from angry serpents or envious persons, who are always ready to attack.

### Translation

**May the Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Vyāsadeva protect me from all kinds of ignorance resulting from the absence of Vedic knowledge. May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge and ritualistic action. May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the Age of Kali.**

### Purport

This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for various purposes. Śrīla Vyāsadeva, Mahāmuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this Age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Śrīla Vyāsadeva, namely the four *Vedas* (*Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg* and *Atharva*), the 108 *Upaniṣads, Vedānta-sūtra* (*Brahma-sūtra*), *Mahābhārata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam Mahā-Purāṇa* (Vyāsadeva’s commentary on the *Brahma-sūtra*) and the other seventeen *Purāṇas.* Only by the mercy of Śrīla Vyāsadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.

As described by Śrīla Jayadeva Gosvāmī in his *Daśāvatāra-stotra,* Lord Buddha apparently decried the Vedic knowledge:

*nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ  
sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita-paśu-ghātam  
keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagad-īśa hare*

The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed. When *pāṣaṇḍīs* were cheating by killing animals on the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic *yajñas,* the Lord said, “If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles.” Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles. One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the injunctions of the *Vedas.*

The Kalki *avatāra* is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this Age of Kali. Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Kṛṣṇa before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of *dharma* on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, *yata mata tata patha.* According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the *Vedas,* and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Keśava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.

### Purport

According to Vedic astronomical calculations, day and night are each divided into thirty *ghaṭikās* (twenty-four minutes), instead of twelve hours. Generally, each day and each night is divided into six parts consisting of five *ghaṭikās.* In each of these six portions of the day and night, the Lord may be addressed for protection according to different names. Lord Keśava, the proprietor of the holy place of Mathurā, is the Lord of the first portion of the day, and Govinda, the Lord of Vṛndāvana, is the master of the second portion.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the material energy, the spiritual energy and the entire creation are all individual substances. In the ultimate analysis, however, together they constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge see unity in diversity. For such advanced persons, the Lord’s bodily decorations, His name, His fame, His attributes and forms and the weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His potency. According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the omniscient Lord, who manifests various forms, is present everywhere. May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.**

### Purport

A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4) where Lord Kṛṣṇa says, *mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam,* indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy. This is confirmed in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (1.22.52):

*eka-deśa-sthitasyāgner  
jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā  
parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis  
tathedam akhilaṁ jagat*

As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies. Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him. There is no difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies. This is also confirmed in the *Padma Purāṇa:*

*nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś  
caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ  
pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto  
’bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ*

The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially. The word *pūrṇa* means “complete.” The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord. Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him. Therefore even worship of the Lord’s weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord. Māyāvādīs refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is *māyā,* or false, but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although the Lord’s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this prayer says, *pātu sarvaiḥ svarūpair naḥ sadā sarvatra sama-gaḥ:* “May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere.” The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees. Śrīla Madhvācārya explains this as follows:

*eka eva paro viṣṇur  
bhūṣāheti dhvajeṣv ajaḥ  
tat-tac-chakti-pradatvena  
svayam eva vyavasthitaḥ  
satyenānena māṁ devaḥ  
pātu sarveśvaro hariḥ*

*etāṁ vidyām adhigato

### Translation

**King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Viśvarūpa. After conquering the demons, he enjoyed all the opulences of the three worlds.**

### Purport

This mystical mantric armor given by Viśvarūpa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the effect that Indra was able to conquer the *asuras* and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without impediments. In this regard, Madhvācārya points out:

*vidyāḥ karmāṇi ca sadā  
guroḥ prāptāḥ phala-pradāḥ  
anyathā naiva phaladāḥ  
prasannoktāḥ phala-pradāḥ*

One must receive all kinds of *mantras* from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the *mantras* will not be fruitful. This is also indicated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.34):

*tad viddhi praṇipātena  
paripraśnena sevayā  
upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ  
jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ*

“Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.” All *mantras* should be received through the authorized *guru,* and the disciple must satisfy the *guru* in all respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet. In the *Padma Purāṇa* it is also said, *sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā matāḥ.* There are four *sampradāyas,* or disciplic successions, namely the Brahma *sampradāya,* the Rudra *sampradāya,* the Śrī *sampradāya* and the Kumāra *sampradāya.* If one wants to advance in spiritual power, one must receive his *mantras* from one of these bona fide *sampradāyas;* otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Nārāyaṇa-kavaca Shield.”*
