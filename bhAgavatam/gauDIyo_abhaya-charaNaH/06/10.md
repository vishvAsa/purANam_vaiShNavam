CHAPTER TEN

As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhīci, a thunderbolt was prepared from Dadhīci’s bones, and a fight took place between Vṛtrāsura and the demigods.

Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhīci Muni and begged for his body. Dadhīci Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion, jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals. Dadhīci Muni first merged his gross body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he gave up his gross body. With the help of Viśvakarmā, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhīci’s bones. Armed with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.

At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Tretā-yuga, a great fight took place between the demigods and the *asuras.* Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the *asuras* fled the battle, leaving Vṛtrāsura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself. Vṛtrāsura, however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield. One who is victorious in battle gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial heavens. In either way, the fighter benefits.

bhikṣamāṇāya viṣṇave*

### Synonyms

*jijīviṣūṇām* — aspiring to remain alive; *jīvānām* — of all living entities; *ātmā* — the body; *preṣṭhaḥ* — very dear; *iha* — here; *īpsitaḥ* — desired; *kaḥ* — who; *utsaheta* — can bear; *tam* — that body; *dātum* — to deliver; *bhikṣamāṇāya* — begging; *viṣṇave* — even to Lord Viṣṇu.

### Translation

**In this material world, every living entity is very much addicted to his material body. Struggling to keep his body forever, everyone tries to protect it by all means, even at the sacrifice of all his possessions. Therefore, who would be prepared to deliver his body to anyone, even if it were demanded by Lord Viṣṇu?**

### Purport

It is said, *ātmānaṁ sarvato rakṣet tato dharmaṁ tato dhanam:* one must protect his body by all means; then he may protect his religious principles and thereafter his possessions. This is the natural desire of all living entities. No one wants to give up his body unless it is forcibly given away. Even though the demigods said that they were demanding Dadhīci’s body for their benefit in accordance with the order of Lord Viṣṇu, Dadhīci superficially refused to give them his body.

*nūnaṁ svārtha-paro loko  
na veda para-saṅkaṭam  
yadi veda na yāceta  
neti nāha yad īśvaraḥ*

### Synonyms

*nūnam* — certainly; *sva*-*artha*-*paraḥ* — interested only in sense gratification in this life or the next; *lokaḥ* — materialistic people in general; *na* — not; *veda* — know; *para*-*saṅkaṭam* — the pain of others; *yadi* — if; *veda* — know; *na* — not; *yāceta* — would ask; *na* — no; *iti* — thus; *na* *āha* — does not say; *yat* — since; *īśvaraḥ* — able to give charity.

### Translation

**Those who are too self-interested beg something from others, not knowing of others’ pain. But if the beggar knew the difficulty of the giver, he would not ask for anything. Similarly, he who is able to give charity does not know the beggar’s difficulty, for otherwise he would not refuse to give the beggar anything he might want as charity.**

### Purport

This verse describes two people — one who gives charity and one who begs for it. A beggar should not ask charity from a person who is in difficulty. Similarly, one who is able to give charity should not deny a beggar. These are the moral instructions of the *śāstra.* Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, *san-nimitte varaṁ tyāgo vināśe niyate sati:* everything within this material world will be destroyed, and therefore one should use everything for good purposes. If one is advanced in knowledge, he must always be prepared to sacrifice anything for a better cause. At the present moment the entire world is in a dangerous position under the spell of a godless civilization. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement needs many exalted, learned persons who will sacrifice their lives to revive God consciousness throughout the world. We therefore invite all men and women advanced in knowledge to join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and sacrifice their lives for the great cause of reviving the God consciousness of human society.

### Translation

### Purport

In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and the Six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana. Concerning Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu it is said in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.34):

*tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ  
dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam  
māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad  
vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam*

“We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord, upon whom one should always meditate. He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy.” To accept *sannyāsa* means to commit civil suicide, but *sannyāsa* is compulsory, at least for every *brāhmaṇa,* every first-class human being. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu took *sannyāsa* and left home when He was only twenty-four years old. He lived a very strict life as a *sannyāsī,* refusing all bodily comforts. Similarly, His disciples the Six Gosvāmīs were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīnivāsa Ācārya says:

*tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tucchavat  
bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau*

These Gosvāmīs left their very comfortable lives as ministers, Zamindars and learned scholars and joined Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (*dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā*). Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and torn quilts (*kaupīna-kantha*), they lived in Vṛndāvana and followed Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s order to excavate Vṛndāvana’s lost glories.

Similarly, everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls. The words *bhūta-dayayā, māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam* and *dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā* all convey the same sense. These are very significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life. One should join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Six Gosvāmīs and, before them, the great sage Dadhīci. Instead of wasting one’s life for temporary bodily comforts, one should always be prepared to give up one’s life for better causes. After all, the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world.

### Verse text

*etāvān avyayo dharmaḥ  
puṇya-ślokair upāsitaḥ  
yo bhūta-śoka-harṣābhyām  
ātmā śocati hṛṣyati*

### Synonyms

*etāvān* — this much; *avyayaḥ* — imperishable; *dharmaḥ* — religious principle; *puṇya*-*ślokaiḥ* — by famous persons who are celebrated as pious; *upāsitaḥ* — recognized; *yaḥ* — which; *bhūta* — of the living beings; *śoka* — by the distress; *harṣābhyām* — and by the happiness; *ātmā* — the mind; *śocati* — laments; *hṛṣyati* — feels happiness.

### Translation

**If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.**

### Purport

One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious principles are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others happy. *Ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:* one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence — *ahiṁsaḥ parama-dharmaḥ* — is established. We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings. Lord Buddha’s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence.

One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man. That is the greatest hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, “Do not kill,” but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse. One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy. This is the principle to be followed. Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals. That is not recommended herein. This verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human, animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (14.4):

*sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya  
mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ  
tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir  
ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā*

“It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.” The different forms of these living entities are only their external dresses. Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God. Therefore one should not favor only one kind of living being. A Vaiṣṇava sees all living entities as part and parcel of God. As the Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (5.18 and 18.54):

*vidyā-vinaya-sampanne  
brāhmaṇe gavi hastini  
śuni caiva śvapāke ca  
paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle *brāhmaṇa,* a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater \[outcaste\].”

*brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā  
na śocati na kāṅkṣati  
samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu  
mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām*

“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.” A Vaiṣṇava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy. A Vaiṣṇava is *para-duḥkha-duḥkhī;* he is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism. Therefore a Vaiṣṇava is always busy preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world.

### Synonyms

*aho* — alas; *dainyam* — a miserable condition; *aho* — alas; *kaṣṭam* — simply tribulation; *pārakyaiḥ* — which after death are eatable by dogs and jackals; *kṣaṇa*-*bhaṅguraiḥ* — perishable at any moment; *yat* — because; *na* — not; *upakuryāt* — would help; *a*-*sva*-*arthaiḥ* — not meant for self-interest; *martyaḥ* — a living entity destined to die; *sva* — with his wealth; *jñāti* — relatives and friends; *vigrahaiḥ* — and his body.

### Translation

**This body, which is eatable by jackals and dogs after death, does not actually do any good for me, the spirit soul. It is usable only for a short time and may perish at any moment. The body and its possessions, its riches and relatives, must all be engaged for the benefit of others, or else they will be sources of tribulation and misery.**

### Purport

Similar advice is also given in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.22.35):

*etāvaj janma-sāphalyaṁ  
dehinām iha dehiṣu  
prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā  
śreya-ācaraṇaṁ sadā*

“It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words.” This is the mission of life. One’s own body and the bodies of his friends and relatives, as well as one’s own riches and everything else one has, should be engaged for the benefit of others. This is the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As stated in *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 9.41):

*bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra  
janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra*

“One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India \[Bhārata-varṣa\] should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.

The word *upakuryāt* means *para-upakāra,* helping others. Of course, in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for philanthropy is ineffectual. They do not know the ultimate goal of life (*śreya ācaraṇam*), which is to please the Supreme Lord. If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving the ultimate goal of life — to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead — they would all be perfect. Humanitarian work without Kṛṣṇa is nothing. Kṛṣṇa must be brought to the center of all our activities; otherwise no activity will have value.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bādarāyaṇiḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *evam* — thus; *kṛta*-*vyavasitaḥ* — making certain of what to do (in giving his body to the demigods); *dadhyaṅ* — Dadhīci Muni; *ātharvaṇaḥ* — the son of Atharvā; *tanum* — his body; *pare* — to the Supreme; *bhagavati* — Personality of Godhead; *brahmaṇi* — the Supreme Brahman; *ātmānam* — himself, the spirit soul; *sannayan* — offering; *jahau* — gave up.

### Translation

**Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Dadhīci Muni, the son of Atharvā, thus resolved to give his body to the service of the demigods. He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.**

### Purport

As indicated by the words *pare bhagavati brahmaṇy ātmānaṁ sannayan,* Dadhīci placed himself, as spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, one may refer to the incident of Dhṛtarāṣṭra’s leaving his body, as described in the First Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.13.55). Dhṛtarāṣṭra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of which it was made — earth, water, fire, air and ether — and distributed them to the different reservoirs of these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original *mahat-tattva.* By identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united with the large sky outside the pot. Māyāvādī philosophers misunderstand this description of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Therefore Śrī Rāmānuja Svāmī, in his book *Vedānta-tattva-sāra,* has described that this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements — earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence — the individual soul engages himself in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (*īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam*). The material cause of the material elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position. As described by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, *jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya-kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa’:* the constitutional position of the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. When one overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage in the service of the Lord.

*yata* — controlled; *akṣa* — senses; *asu* — the life air; *manaḥ* — the mind; *buddhiḥ* — intelligence; *tattva*-*dṛk* — one who knows the *tattvas,* the material and spiritual energies; *dhvasta*-*bandhanaḥ* — liberated from bondage; *āsthitaḥ* — being situated in; *paramam* — the supreme; *yogam* — absorption, trance; *na* — not; *deham* — the material body; *bubudhe* — perceived; *gatam* — left.

### Translation

**Dadhīci Muni controlled his senses, life force, mind and intelligence and became absorbed in trance. Thus he cut all his material bonds. He could not perceive how his material body became separated from his self.**

### Purport

The Lord says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.5):

*anta-kāle ca mām eva  
smaran muktvā kalevaram  
yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ  
yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ*

“Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.” Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect *yogī,* namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Kṛṣṇa. He does not feel his material body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world. *Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti:* the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again, but is transferred back home, back to Godhead. This *yoga, bhakti-yoga,* is the highest *yoga* system, as explained by the Lord Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.47):

*yoginām api sarveṣāṁ  
mad-gatenāntarātmanā  
śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ  
sa me yuktatamo mataḥ*

“Of all *yogīs,* he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in *yoga* and is the highest of all.” The *bhakti-yogī* always thinks of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to Kṛṣṇaloka, without even perceiving the pains of death.

Thus he shone very beautifully, pleasing the three worlds as he rode off to kill Vṛtrāsura.**

### Synonyms

*tataḥ* — thereafter; *surāṇām* — of the demigods; *asuraiḥ* — with the demons; *raṇaḥ* — a great battle; *parama*-*dāruṇaḥ* — very fearful; *tretā*-*mukhe* — in the beginning of Tretā-yuga; *narmadāyām* — on the bank of the river Narmadā; *abhavat* — took place; *prathame* — in the first; *yuge* — millennium.

### Translation

**Thereafter, at the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Tretā-yuga, a fierce battle took place between the demigods and the demons on the bank of the Narmadā.**

### Purport

Herein the Narmadā does not mean the Narmadā River in India. The five sacred rivers in India — Gaṅgā, Yamunā, Narmadā, Kāverī and Kṛṣṇā — are all celestial. Like the Ganges River, the Narmadā River also flows in the higher planetary systems. The battle between the demigods and the demons took place in the higher planets.

The words *prathame yuge* mean “in the beginning of the first millennium,” that is to say, in the beginning of the Vaivasvata *manvantara.* In one day of Brahmā there are fourteen Manus, who each live for seventy-one millenniums. The four *yugas* — Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali — constitute one millennium. We are presently in the *manvantara* of Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in *Bhagavad-gītā* (*imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam/ vivasvān manave prāha*). We are now in the twenty-eighth millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu’s first millennium. One can historically calculate how long ago the battle took place. Since each millennium consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years have passed since the battle took place on the bank of the river Narmadā.

Surrounded by his company, Indra shone so brightly that his effulgence was intolerable to the demons.**

There is a Bengali saying that if a vulture curses a cow to die, the curse will not be effective. Similarly, accusations made by demoniac persons against devotees of Kṛṣṇa cannot have any effect. The demigods are devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and therefore the curses of the demons were futile.

### Translation

**Vṛtrāsura said: All living entities who have taken birth in this material world must die. Surely, no one in this world has found any means to be saved from death. Even providence has not provided a means to escape it. Under the circumstances, death being inevitable, if one can gain promotion to the higher planetary systems and be always celebrated here by dying a suitable death, what man will not accept such a glorious death?**

### Purport

If by dying one can be elevated to the higher planetary systems and be ever-famous after his death, who is so foolish that he will refuse such a glorious death? Similar advice was also given by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna. “My dear Arjuna,” the Lord said, “do not desist from fighting. If you gain victory in the fight, you will enjoy a kingdom, and even if you die you will be elevated to the heavenly planets.” Everyone should be ready to die while performing glorious deeds. A glorious person is not meant to meet death like cats and dogs.

### Translation

**There are two ways to meet a glorious death, and both are very rare. One is to die after performing mystic yoga, especially bhakti-yoga, by which one can control the mind and living force and die absorbed in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The second is to die on the battlefield, leading the army and never showing one’s back. These two kinds of death are recommended in the śāstra as glorious.**
