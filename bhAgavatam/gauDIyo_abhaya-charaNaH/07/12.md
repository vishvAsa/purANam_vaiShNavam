CHAPTER TWELVE

This chapter particularly describes the *brahmacārī* and the person in the *vānaprastha* stage, and it also gives a general description of the four *āśramas* — *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* In the previous chapter, the great saint Nārada Muni has described the *varṇa* institution of society, and now, in this chapter, he will describe the stages of spiritual advancement in the four *āśramas,* which are known as *brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.*

The *brahmacārī* should live under the care of the true spiritual master, giving him sincere respect and obeisances, acting as his menial servant, and always carrying out his order. The *brahmacārī* should engage himself in spiritual activities and study the Vedic literature under the direction of the spiritual master. According to the *brahmacarya* system, he should dress with a belt, deerskin, and matted hair and should bear a *daṇḍa,* waterpot and sacred thread. He should collect alms daily in the morning, and in the evening whatever alms he has collected he should offer to the spiritual master. A *brahmacārī* should accept *prasāda* upon the order of the spiritual master, and if the spiritual master sometimes forgets to order the disciple to eat, the disciple should not take *prasāda* on his own initiative; rather, he should fast. The *brahmacārī* should be trained to be satisfied with eating what is absolutely necessary, he should be very expert in executing responsibilities, he should be faithful, and he should control his senses and try to avoid the association of women as far as possible. A *brahmacārī* should very strictly abstain from living with women and should not meet with *gṛhasthas* and those too addicted to women. Nor should a *brahmacārī* speak in a lonely place with a woman.

After completing one’s education as a *brahmacārī* in this way, one should give *dakṣiṇā,* an offering of gratitude, to one’s *guru,* and then one may leave for home and accept the next *āśrama* — the *gṛhastha-āśrama* — or else one may continue in the *brahmacarya-āśrama* without adulteration. The duties for the *gṛhastha-āśrama* and *brahmacarya-āśrama,* as well as the duties for *sannyāsīs,* are prescribed in the *śāstras.* A *gṛhastha* is not meant to enjoy sex life without restriction. Indeed, the whole purpose of Vedic life is to become free from sexual indulgence. All the *āśramas* are recognized for spiritual progress, and therefore although the *gṛhastha-āśrama* gives a kind of license for sex life for a certain time, it does not allow unrestricted sex life. Therefore, in *gṛhastha* life also, there is no illicit sex. A *gṛhastha* should not accept a woman for sexual enjoyment. Wasting semen is also illicit sex.

After the *gṛhastha-āśrama* is another *āśrama,* known as *vānaprastha,* which is midway between *gṛhastha* and *sannyāsa.* A person in the *vānaprastha* order is restricted in eating food grains and forbidden to eat fruits that have not ripened on the tree. Nor should he cook food with fire, although he is allowed to eat *caru,* grains that have been offered in a sacrificial fire. He may also eat fruits and grains that have grown naturally. Living in a thatched cottage, the *vānaprastha* should endure all kinds of heat and cold. He should not cut his nails or hair, and he should give up cleaning his body and teeth. He should wear tree bark, accept a *daṇḍa,* and practice life in the forest, taking a vow to live there for twelve years, eight years, four years, two years or at least one year. At last, when because of old age he can no longer perform the activities of a *vānaprastha,* he should gradually stop everything and in this way give up his body.

सुशीलो मितभुग्दक्ष- श्रद्दधानो जितेन्द्रिय- ।  
यावदर्थं व्यवहरेत् स्त्रीषु स्त्रीनिर्जितेषु च ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*suśīlo mita-bhug dakṣaḥ  
śraddadhāno jitendriyaḥ  
yāvad-arthaṁ vyavaharet  
strīṣu strī-nirjiteṣu ca*

### Synonyms

*su*-*śīlaḥ* — very polite and well-behaved; *mita*-*bhuk* — eating only exactly what he needs, neither more nor less; *dakṣaḥ* — expert or without laziness, always busy; *śraddadhānaḥ* — possessing full faith in the instructions of the *śāstra* and the spiritual master; *jita*-*indriyaḥ* — having full control over the senses; *yāvat*-*artham* — as much as necessary; *vyavaharet* — should behave externally; *strīṣu* — unto women; *strī*-*nirjiteṣu* — men who are henpecked, controlled by women; *ca* — also.

Fully controlling his senses, he should associate only as much as necessary with women or those controlled by women.**

### Purport

A *brahmacārī* should be very careful not to mix with women or with men addicted to women. Although when he goes out to beg alms it is necessary to talk with women and with men very much attached to women, this association should be very short, and he should talk with them only about begging alms, and not more. A *brahmacārī* should be very careful in associating with men who are attached to women.

वर्जयेत्प्रमदागाथामगृहस्थो बृहद्‌व्रत- ।

### Verse text

*varjayet pramadā-gāthām  
agṛhastho bṛhad-vrataḥ  
indriyāṇi pramāthīni  
haranty api yater manaḥ*

### Synonyms

*varjayet* — must give up; *pramadā*-*gāthām* — talking with women; *agṛhasthaḥ* — a person who has not accepted the *gṛhastha-āśrama* (a *brahmacārī* or *sannyāsī*); *bṛhat*-*vrataḥ* — invariably observing the vow of celibacy; *indriyāṇi* — the senses; *pramāthīni* — almost always unconquerable; *haranti* — take away; *api* — even; *yateḥ* — of the *sannyāsī*; *manaḥ* — the mind.

### Translation

**A brahmacārī, or one who has not accepted the gṛhastha-āśrama \[family life\], must rigidly avoid talking with women or about women, for the senses are so powerful that they may agitate even the mind of a sannyāsī, a member of the renounced order of life.**

### Purport

*Brahmacarya* essentially means the vow not to marry but to observe strict celibacy (*bṛhad-vrata*). A *brahmacārī* or *sannyāsī* should avoid talking with women or reading literature concerning talks between man and woman. The injunction restricting association with women is the basic principle of spiritual life. Associating or talking with women is never advised in any of the Vedic literatures. The entire Vedic system teaches one to avoid sex life so that one may gradually progress from *brahmacarya* to *gṛhastha,* from *gṛhastha* to *vānaprastha,* and from *vānaprastha* to *sannyāsa* and thus give up material enjoyment, which is the original cause of bondage to this material world. The word *bṛhad-vrata* refers to one who has decided not to marry, or in other words, not to indulge in sex life throughout his entire life.

केशप्रसाधनोन्मर्दस्‍नपनाभ्यञ्जनादिकम् ।  
गुरुस्त्रीभिर्युवतिभि- कारयेन्नात्मनो युवा ॥ ८ ॥

### Verse text

*keśa-prasādhanonmarda-  
snapanābhyañjanādikam  
guru-strībhir yuvatibhiḥ  
kārayen nātmano yuvā*

### Synonyms

*keśa*-*prasādhana* — brushing the hair; *unmarda* — massaging the body; *snapana* — bathing; *abhyañjana*-*ādikam* — massaging the body with oil and so on; *guru*-*strībhiḥ* — by the wife of the spiritual master; *yuvatibhiḥ* — very young; *kārayet* — should allow to do; *na* — never; *ātmanaḥ* — for personal service; *yuvā* — if the student is a young man.

### Translation

**If the wife of the spiritual master is young, a young brahmacārī should not allow her to care for his hair, massage his body with oil, or bathe him with affection like a mother.**

### Purport

The relationship between the student or disciple and the wife of the spiritual master or teacher is like that between son and mother. A mother sometimes cares for her son by combing his hair, massaging his body with oil, or bathing him. Similarly, the wife of the teacher is also a mother (*guru-patnī*), and therefore she may also care for the disciple in a motherly way. If the wife of the teacher is a young woman, however, a young *brahmacārī* should not allow such a mother to touch him. This is strictly prohibited. There are seven kinds of mothers:

*ātma-mātā guroḥ patnī  
brāhmaṇī rāja-patnikā  
dhenur dhātrī tathā pṛthvī  
saptaitā mātaraḥ smṛtāḥ*

These mothers are the original mother, the wife of the teacher or spiritual master, the wife of a *brāhmaṇa,* the king’s wife, the cow, the nurse and the earth. Unnecessary association with women, even with one’s mother, sister or daughter, is strictly prohibited. This is human civilization. A civilization that allows men to mix unrestrictedly with women is an animal civilization. In Kali-yuga, people are extremely liberal, but mixing with women and talking with them as equals actually constitutes an uncivilized way of life.

### Verse text

*nanv agniḥ pramadā nāma  
ghṛta-kumbha-samaḥ pumān  
sutām api raho jahyād  
anyadā yāvad-artha-kṛt*

### Synonyms

*nanu* — certainly; *agniḥ* — the fire; *pramadā* — the woman (one who bewilders the mind of man); *nāma* — the very name; *ghṛta*-*kumbha* — a pot of butter; *samaḥ* — like; *pumān* — a man; *sutām* *api* — even one’s daughter; *rahaḥ* — in a secluded place; *jahyāt* — one must not associate with; *anyadā* — with other women also; *yāvat* — as much as; *artha*-*kṛt* — required.

### Translation

**Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot. Therefore a man should avoid associating even with his own daughter in a secluded place. Similarly, he should also avoid association with other women. One should associate with women only for important business and not otherwise.**

### Purport

If a butter pot and fire are kept together, the butter within the pot will certainly melt. Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot. However advanced one may be in restraining the senses, it is almost impossible for a man to keep himself controlled in the presence of a woman, even if she is his own daughter, mother or sister. Indeed, his mind is agitated even if one is in the renounced order of life. Therefore, Vedic civilization carefully restricts mingling between men and women. If one cannot understand the basic principle of restraining association between man and woman, he is to be considered an animal. That is the purport of this verse.

कल्पयित्वात्मना यावदाभासमिदमीश्वर- ।  
द्वैतं तावन्न विरमेत्ततो ह्यस्य विपर्यय- ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*kalpayitvātmanā yāvad  
ābhāsam idam īśvaraḥ  
dvaitaṁ tāvan na viramet  
tato hy asya viparyayaḥ*

### Synonyms

*kalpayitvā* — ascertaining positively; *ātmanā* — by self-realization; *yāvat* — as long as; *ābhāsam* — reflection (of the original body and senses); *idam* — this (the body and senses); *īśvaraḥ* — completely independent of illusion; *dvaitam* — duality; *tāvat* — for that long; *na* — does not; *viramet* — see; *tataḥ* — by such duality; *hi* — indeed; *asya* — of the person; *viparyayaḥ* — counteraction.

### Translation

**As long as a living entity is not completely self-realized — as long as he is not independent of the misconception of identifying with his body, which is nothing but a reflection of the original body and senses — he cannot be relieved of the conception of duality, which is epitomized by the duality between man and woman. Thus there is every chance that he will fall down because his intelligence is bewildered.**

### Purport

Here is another important warning that a man must save himself from attraction to woman. Until one is self-realized, fully independent of the illusory conception of the material body, the duality of man and woman must undoubtedly continue, but when one is actually self-realized this distinction ceases.

*vidyā-vinaya-sampanne  
brāhmaṇe gavi hastini  
śuni caiva śvapāke ca  
paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ*

“The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle *brāhmaṇa,* a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater \outcaste\].” ([Bg. 5.18) On the spiritual platform, the learned person not only gives up the duality of man and woman, but also gives up the duality of man and animal. This is the test of self-realization. One must realize perfectly that the living being is spirit soul but is tasting various types of material bodies. One may theoretically understand this, but when one has practical realization, then he actually becomes a *paṇḍita,* one who knows. Until that time, the duality continues, and the conception of man and woman also continues. In this stage, one should be extremely careful about mixing with women. No one should think himself perfect and forget the śāstric instruction that one should be very careful about associating even with his daughter, mother or sister, not to speak of other women. Śrīla Madhvācārya cites the following *ślokas* in this regard:

*bahutvenaiva vastūnāṁ  
yathārtha-jñānam ucyate  
advaita-jñānam ity etad  
dvaita-jñānaṁ tad-anyathā*

*yathā jñānaṁ tathā vastu  
yathā vastus tathā matiḥ  
naiva jñānārthayor bhedas  
tata ekatva-vedanam*

Unity in variety is real knowledge, and therefore giving up variety artificially does not reflect perfect knowledge of monism. According to the *acintya-bhedābheda* philosophy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, there are varieties, but all of them constitute one unit. Such knowledge is knowledge of perfect oneness.

एतत्सर्वं गृहस्थस्य समाम्नातं यतेरपि ।

### Verse text

*etat sarvaṁ gṛhasthasya  
samāmnātaṁ yater api  
guru-vṛttir vikalpena  
gṛhasthasyartu-gāminaḥ*

### Synonyms

*etat* — this; *sarvam* — all; *gṛhasthasya* — of a householder; *samāmnātam* — described; *yateḥ* *api* — even of the person in the renounced order; *guru*-*vṛttiḥ* *vikalpena* — to follow the orders of the spiritual master; *gṛhasthasya* — of the householder; *ṛtu*-*gāminaḥ* — accepting sex only during the period favorable for procreation.

### Translation

**All the rules and regulations apply equally to the householder and the sannyāsī, the member of the renounced order of life. The gṛhastha, however, is given permission by the spiritual master to indulge in sex during the period favorable for procreation.**

### Purport

It is sometimes misunderstood that a *gṛhastha,* a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time. This is a wrong conception of *gṛhastha* life. In spiritual life, whether one is a *gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsī* or *brahmacārī,* everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For *brahmacārīs* and *sannyāsīs* there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for *gṛhasthas.* *Gṛhasthas* should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the *guru.* Therefore it is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (*guru-vṛttir vikalpena*). When the spiritual master orders, the *gṛhastha* may accept sex life. This is confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.11). *Dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo ’smi:* indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The *gṛhastha* is allowed to indulge in sex life during the period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master’s order. If the spiritual master’s orders allow a *gṛhastha* to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the *gṛhastha* may do so; otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the *gṛhastha* should abstain. The *gṛhastha* must obtain permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of *garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.* Then he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A *brāhmaṇa* generally remains a *brahmacārī* throughout his entire life, but although some *brāhmaṇas* become *gṛhasthas* and indulge in sex life, they do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The *kṣatriya* is allowed to marry more than one wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that because one is a *gṛhastha* he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one’s whole life under the guidance of the *guru.* Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. *Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ*. If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter. *Yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto ’pi*. Without the spiritual master’s order, even the *gṛhastha* should not indulge in sex life.

### Translation

These they should give up.**

### Translation

**According to the rules and regulations mentioned above, one who is twice-born, namely a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya or vaiśya, should reside in the gurukula under the care of the spiritual master. There he should study and learn all the Vedic literatures along with their supplements and the Upaniṣads, according to his ability and power to study. If possible, the student or disciple should reward the spiritual master with the remuneration the spiritual master requests, and then, following the master’s order, the disciple should leave and accept one of the other āśramas, namely the gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama or sannyāsa-āśrama, as he desires.**

### Purport

To study the *Vedas* and understand them, of course, requires some special intelligence, but the members of the three higher sections of society — namely the *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* — must learn the Vedic literatures according to their capability and power to understand. In other words, studying the Vedic literatures is compulsory for everyone but the *śūdras* and *antyajas.* The Vedic literature gives the knowledge that can lead one to understand the Absolute Truth — Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān. *Gurukula,* or the reformatory educational institution, should be used only to understand Vedic knowledge. At the present time there are many educational institutions for training and technology, but such knowledge has nothing to do with understanding of the Absolute Truth. Technology, therefore, is meant for the *śūdras,* whereas the *Vedas* are meant for the *dvijas.* Consequently this verse states, *dvijo ’dhītyāvabudhya ca trayīṁ sāṅgopaniṣadam.* At the present time, in the Age of Kali, practically everyone is a *śūdra,* and no one is a *dvija.* Therefore the condition of society has very much deteriorated.

Another point to be observed from this verse is that from the *brahmacārī-āśrama* one may accept the *sannyāsa-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama* or *gṛhastha-āśrama.* It is not compulsory for a *brahmacārī* to become a *gṛhastha.* Because the ultimate aim is to understand the Absolute Truth, there is no necessity of going through all the different *āśramas.* Thus one may proceed to the *sannyāsa-āśrama* directly from the *brahmacārī-āśrama.* Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura accepted the *sannyāsa-āśrama* directly from the *brahmacārī-āśrama.* In other words, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura did not think it compulsory to accept the *gṛhastha-āśrama* or *vānaprastha-āśrama.*

अग्नौ गुरावात्मनि च सर्वभूतेष्वधोक्षजम् ।  
भूतै- स्वधामभि- पश्येदप्रविष्टं प्रविष्टवत् ॥ १५ ॥

### Verse text

*agnau gurāv ātmani ca  
sarva-bhūteṣv adhokṣajam  
bhūtaiḥ sva-dhāmabhiḥ paśyed  
apraviṣṭaṁ praviṣṭavat*

### Synonyms

*agnau* — in the fire; *gurau* — in the spiritual master; *ātmani* — in one’s self; *ca* — also; *sarva*-*bhūteṣu* — in every living entity; *adhokṣajam* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who cannot be seen or perceived with the material eyes or other material senses; *bhūtaiḥ* — with all living entities; *sva*-*dhāmabhiḥ* — along with His Lordship’s paraphernalia; *paśyet* — one should see; *apraviṣṭam* — not entered; *praviṣṭa*-*vat* — also entered.

### Translation

**One should realize that in the fire, in the spiritual master, in one’s self and in all living entities — in all circumstances and conditions — the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, has simultaneously entered and not entered. He is situated externally and internally as the full controller of everything.**

### Purport

Realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s omnipresence is the perfect realization of the Absolute Truth to be attained through the study of the Vedic literatures. As stated in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.35), *aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham:* the Lord is situated within the universe, within the heart of every living entity and also within the atom. We should understand that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, He is present with all His paraphernalia, including His name, form, associates and servants. The living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus one should understand that since the Supreme Lord has entered the atom, the living entities are also there. One must accept the inconceivable quality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for no one can understand from the material point of view how the Lord is all-pervasive and yet is situated in His own abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana. This realization is possible if one strictly follows the regulative principles of *āśrama* (*brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa*). Śrīla Madhvācārya says in this regard:

*apraviṣṭaḥ sarva-gataḥ  
praviṣṭas tv anurūpavān  
evaṁ dvi-rūpo bhagavān  
harir eko janārdanaḥ*

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His original form, has not entered everything (*apraviṣṭaḥ*), but in His impersonal form He has entered (*praviṣṭaḥ*). Thus He has entered and not entered simultaneously. This is also explained in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4), wherein the Lord says:

*mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ  
jagad avyakta-mūrtinā  
mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni  
na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ*

“By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.” The Lord can defy Himself. Thus there is variety in unity (*ekatvaṁ bahutvam*).

### Synonyms

*evam* *vidhaḥ* — in this way; *brahmacārī* — whether one is a *brahmacārī*; *vānaprasthaḥ* — or one is in the *vānaprastha-āśrama*; *yatiḥ* — or in the *sannyāsa-āśrama*; *gṛhī* — or in the *gṛhastha-āśrama*; *caran* — by practice of self-realization and understanding of the Absolute Truth; *vidita*-*vijñānaḥ* — fully conversant with the science of the Absolute Truth; *param* — the Supreme; *brahma* — the Absolute Truth; *adhigacchati* — one can understand.

### Translation

**By practicing in this way, whether one be in the brahmacārī-āśrama, gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama or sannyāsa-āśrama, one must always realize the all-pervading presence of the Supreme Lord, for in this way it is possible to understand the Absolute Truth.**

### Purport

This is the beginning of self-realization. One must first understand how Brahman is present everywhere and how He is acting. This education is called *brahma-jijñāsā* and is the real concern of human life. Without such knowledge, one cannot claim to be a human being; rather, he remains in the animal kingdom. As it is said, *sa eva go-kharaḥ:* without such knowledge, one is no better than a cow or an ass.

### Purport

The body is an effect of a cause, namely the five material elements (earth, water, fire, air and sky). In other words, one should know perfectly well that the material body is nothing but a combination of the five elements. This knowledge constitutes merging of the material body and the five material elements. Merging into Brahman in perfect knowledge means understanding perfectly that one is not the body but a spiritual soul.

### Translation

**A sober, self-realized person who has full knowledge should merge the various parts of the body in their original sources. The holes in the body are caused by the sky, the process of breathing is caused by the air, the heat of the body is caused by fire, and semen, blood and mucus are caused by water. The hard substances, like skin, muscle and bone, are caused by earth. In this way all the constituents of the body are caused by various elements, and they should be merged again into those elements.**

### Purport

To be self-realized, one must understand the original sources of the various elements of the body. The body is a combination of skin, bone, muscle, blood, semen, urine, stool, heat, breath and so on, which all come from earth, water, fire, air and sky. One must be well conversant with the sources of all the bodily constituents. Then one becomes a self-realized person, or *ātmavān,* one who knows the self.

The rectum, with the power of evacuation, should be bestowed, in its proper place, unto Mṛtyu.

Material consciousness, along with the goal of thought, should be merged in the individual living being, and the demigods acting under the modes of material nature should be merged, along with the perverted living being, into the Supreme Being. The earth should be merged in water, water in the brightness of the sun, this brightness into the air, the air into the sky, the sky into the false ego, the false ego into the total material energy, the total material energy into the unmanifested ingredients \[the pradhāna feature of the material energy\], and at last the ingredient feature of material manifestation into the Supersoul.**
