CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX

This chapter explains how unfavorable association is a threat to one’s position in devotional service and how by associating with saintly persons one can attain the highest platform of devotion.

The *jīva* who has received a human body, which is in itself most conducive toward achieving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who has situated himself in the duties of devotional service to the Lord becomes capable of realizing Him, the very identity of spiritual bliss. Such a person, fully dedicated to the Supreme Personality, is liberated from the influence of Māyā*;* even while continuing to reside in this world created by illusion he is totally untouched by it. Those souls, on the other hand, who are bound up by Māyā are devoted only to their bellies and genitals. They are impure, and by associating with them one will fall down into the dark pit of ignorance.

The emperor Purūravā, who was bewildered by the association of the heavenly lady Urvaśī, later became renounced after being separated from her. He thus sang a song expressing his contempt for womanly connection. He described that persons who are attached to the body of a woman (or a man) — which is simply a mass of skin, meat, blood, sinew, brain tissue, marrow and bones — are not much different from worms. What is the worth of the education, austerity, renunciation, reception of the *Vedas,* solitary living and silence of one whose mind becomes stolen away by the body of a woman? Learned men should distrust their six mental enemies, headed by lust, and thus avoid associating with women or with men who are controlled by women. After declaring these facts, King Purūravā, now freed from the illusion of material existence, attained realization of the Supreme Lord in His form as the indwelling Supersoul.

In conclusion, one who is intelligent should give up bad association and let himself become attracted to the company of saintly persons. By their transcendental instructions, the saintly devotees of the Lord can break the false attachments of one’s mind. Real saints are always liberated and devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their association there are constant discussions about the Supreme Lord, by serving whom the spirit soul completely eradicates his material sins and obtains pure devotional service. And when one gains the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original ocean of unlimited perfect qualities, what else remains to be gained?

श्रीभगवानुवाच  
मल्ल‍क्षणमिमं कायं लब्ध्वा मद्धर्म आस्थित- ।  
आनन्दं परमात्मानमात्मस्थं समुपैति माम् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
*mal-lakṣaṇam imaṁ kāyaṁ  
labdhvā mad-dharma āsthitaḥ  
ānandaṁ paramātmānam  
ātma-sthaṁ samupaiti mām*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *mat*-*lakṣaṇam* — in which I can be realized; *imam* — this; *kāyam* — human body; *labdhvā* — having achieved; *mat*-*dharme* — in devotional service to Me; *āsthitaḥ* — situated; *ānandam* — who is pure ecstasy; *parama*-*ātmānam* — the Supreme Soul; *ātma*-*stham* — situated within the heart; *samapaiti* — he achieves; *mām* — Me.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Having achieved this human form of life, which affords one the opportunity to realize Me, and being situated in My devotional service, one can achieve Me, the reservoir of all pleasure and the Supreme Soul of all existence, residing within the heart of every living being.**

### Purport

Because of bad association, even those who are spiritually liberated may fall down from self-realization. Within the material world the association of women is especially dangerous, and therefore in this chapter the *Aila-gītā* is spoken to prevent such a falldown. One can be saved from sex attraction by association with saintly persons, who awaken one’s real spiritual intelligence. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa will speak to Uddhava the amazing song of Purūravā, also known as the *Aila-gītā.*

गुणमय्या जीवयोन्या विमुक्तो ज्ञाननिष्ठया ।  
गुणेषु मायामात्रेषु द‍ृश्यमानेष्ववस्तुत- ।  
वर्तमानोऽपि न पुमान् युज्यतेऽवस्तुभिर्गुणै- ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*guṇa-mayyā jīva-yonyā  
vimukto jñāna-niṣṭhayā  
guṇeṣu māyā-mātreṣu  
dṛśyamāneṣv avastutaḥ  
vartamāno ’pi na pumān  
yujyate ’vastubhir guṇaiḥ*

### Synonyms

*guṇa*-*mayyā* — based on the modes of nature; *jīva*-*yonyā* — from the cause of material life, false identification; *vimuktaḥ* — one who has become completely free; *jñāna* — in transcendental knowledge; *niṣṭhayā* — by being properly fixed; *guṇeṣu* — among the products of the modes of nature; *māyā*-*mātreṣu* — which are simply illusion; *dṛśyamāneṣu* — appearing before the eyes; *avastutaḥ* — although not real; *vartamānaḥ* — living; *api* — although; *na* — does not; *pumān* — that person; *yujyate* — become entangled; *avastubhiḥ* — unreal; *guṇaiḥ* — with the manifestations of the modes of nature.

### Translation

**A person fixed in transcendental knowledge is freed from conditioned life by giving up his false identification with the products of the material modes of nature. Seeing these products as simply illusion, he avoids entanglement with the modes of nature, although constantly among them. Because the modes of nature and their products are simply not real, he does not accept them.**

### Purport

The three modes of nature become manifest as varieties of material bodies, places, families, countries, foods, sports, war, peace and so forth. In other words, everything we see within the material world is constituted of the modes of nature. A liberated soul, although existing within the ocean of material energy, sees everything as the property of the Lord and is thus not entangled. Although Māyā tempts such a liberated soul to become a thief — to steal the property of the Lord for sense gratification — a Kṛṣṇa conscious person does not bite the bait of Māyā*;* he remains honest and pure in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In other words, he does not believe that anything within the universe can become his personal property for sense gratification, especially the illusory form of a woman.

On being separated from Urvaśī, he felt great bewilderment at first. But after meeting her briefly at Kurukṣetra, he worshiped the demigods with the sacrificial fire given him by the Gandharvas and received the privilege of entering the planet where she resided.

*kim* — what is the use; *vidyayā* — of knowledge; *kim* — what; *tapasā* — of austerities; *kim* — what; *tyāgena* — of renunciation; *śrutena* — of having studied the scriptures; *vā* — or; *kim* — what; *viviktena* — of solitude; *maunena* — of silence; *strībhiḥ* — by women; *yasya* — whose; *manaḥ* — the mind; *hṛtam* — taken away.

### Translation

**What is the use of a big education or the practice of austerities and renunciation, and what is the use of studying religious scriptures, of living in solitude and silence, if, after all that, one’s mind is stolen by a woman?**

### Purport

All of the above-mentioned processes are useless if one’s heart and mind are stolen by an insignificant woman. One who hankers after a woman’s association certainly spoils his spiritual progress. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that if one worships the example of the liberated *gopīs* of Vṛndāvana, who accepted Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as their paramour, one can free one’s mental activities from the contamination of lust.

*svārthasyākovidaṁ dhiṅ māṁ

### Translation

**To hell with me! I am such a fool that I didn’t even know what was good for me, although I arrogantly thought I was highly intelligent. Although I achieved the exalted position of a lord, I allowed myself to be conquered by women as if I were a bullock or a jackass.**

### Purport

All the fools of this world consider themselves very wise scholars even though, intoxicated by sense gratification and maddened by their lust for women’s association, they become just like bullocks and jackasses. By the mercy of a saintly spiritual master, this lusty propensity can gradually be removed and one can understand the terrible, contemptible nature of material sense gratification. In this verse King Purūravā is coming to his senses in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

sūkta-vākyena durmateḥ

### Translation

**Because I allowed my intelligence to become dull and because I failed to control my senses, the great confusion in my mind did not go away, even though Urvaśī herself gave me wise counsel with well-spoken words.**

### Purport

As described in the Ninth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the goddess Urvaśī plainly told Purūravā that he should never trust women or believe their promises. Despite this frank advice, he became fully attached and thus suffered great mental anguish.

### Verse text

*kim etayā no ’pakṛtaṁ  
rajjvā vā sarpa-cetasaḥ  
draṣṭuḥ svarūpāviduṣo  
yo ’haṁ yad ajitendriyaḥ*

### Synonyms

### Translation

**How can I blame her for my trouble when I myself am ignorant of my real, spiritual nature? I did not control my senses, and so I am like a person who mistakenly sees a harmless rope as a snake.**

### Purport

When a person mistakes a rope for a snake, he becomes fearful and anxious. Such fear and anxiety are, of course, illusion, since the rope can never bite. Similarly, one who mistakenly thinks that the material, illusory energy of the Lord exists for his personal sense gratification will certainly bring down on his head an avalanche of material, illusory fear and anxiety. King Purūravā frankly admits here that the young lady Urvaśī is not to blame. After all, it was Purūravā who mistakenly considered her to be an object of his personal enjoyment, and therefore he suffered the reaction by the laws of nature. Purūravā himself was the offender for trying to exploit the external form of Urvaśī.

### Translation

**What is this polluted body anyway — so filthy and full of bad odors? I was attracted by the fragrance and beauty of a woman’s body, but what are those so-called attractive features? They are simply a false covering created by illusion.**

### Purport

Purūravā now understands that although he was madly attracted to the fragrant, shapely body of Urvaśī, in fact that body was a sack of stool, gas, bile, mucus, hairs and other repugnant elements. In other words, Purūravā is now becoming sane.

*pitroḥ* — of the parents; *kim* — whether; *svam* — the property; *nu* — or; *bhāryāyāḥ* — of the wife; *svāminaḥ* — of the employer; *agneḥ* — of the fire; *śva*-*gṛdhrayoḥ* — of the dogs and vultures; *kim* — whether; *ātmanaḥ* — of the soul; *kim* — whether; *suhṛdām* — of friends; *iti* — thus; *yaḥ* — who; *na* *avasīyate* — can never decide; *tasmin* — to that; *kalevare* — material body; *amedhye* — abominable; *tuccha*-*niṣṭhe* — heading toward the lowest destination; *viṣajjate* — becomes attached; *aho* — ah; *su*-*bhadram* — very attractive; *su*-*nasam* — having a beautiful nose; *su*-*smitam* — beautiful smile; *ca* — and; *mukham* — the face; *striyaḥ* — of a woman.

### Translation

**One can never decide whose property the body actually is. Does it belong to one’s parents, who have given birth to it, to one’s wife, who gives it pleasure, or to one’s employer, who orders the body around? Is it the property of the funeral fire or of the dogs and jackals who may ultimately devour it? Is it the property of the indwelling soul, who partakes in its happiness and distress, or does the body belong to intimate friends who encourage and help it? Although a man never definitely ascertains the proprietor of the body, he becomes most attached to it. The material body is a polluted material form heading toward a lowly destination, yet when a man stares at the face of a woman he thinks, “What a good-looking lady! What a charming nose she’s got, and see her beautiful smile!”**

### Purport

The phrase *tuccha-niṣṭhe,* or “headed toward a lowly destination,” indicates that if buried, the body will be consumed by worms; if burned, it will turn to ashes; and if dying in a lonely place, it will be consumed by dogs and vultures. The illusory potency of Māyā enters within the female form and bewilders a man’s mind. The man is attracted to Māyā appearing within the female form, but when he embraces the woman’s body he ends up with two handfuls of stool, blood, mucus, pus, skin, bone, hairs and flesh. People should not be like cats and dogs, in the ignorance of bodily consciousness. A human being should be enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and learn to serve the Supreme Lord without falsely trying to exploit His potencies.

### Verse text

*athāpi nopasajjeta

### Synonyms

*atha* *api* — yet therefore; *na* *upasajjeta* — he should never make contact; *strīṣu* — with women; *straiṇeṣu* — with men who are attached to women; *ca* — or; *artha*-*vit* — one who knows what is best for him; *viṣaya* — of the objects of enjoyment; *indriya* — with the senses; *saṁyogāt* — because of the connection; *manaḥ* — the mind; *kṣubhyati* — becomes agitated; *na* — not; *anyathā* — otherwise.

*adṛṣṭād aśrutād bhāvān

asamprayuñjataḥ prāṇān  
śāmyati stimitaṁ manaḥ*

### Synonyms

*adṛṣṭāt* — which is not seen; *aśrutāt* — which is not heard; *bhāvāt* — from a thing; *na* — does not; *bhāvaḥ* — mental agitation; *upajāyate* — arise; *asamprayuñjataḥ* — for one who is not using; *prāṇān* — the senses; *śāmyati* — becomes pacified; *stimitam* — checked; *manaḥ* — the mind.

### Translation

**Because the mind is not disturbed by that which is neither seen nor heard, the mind of a person who restricts the material senses will automatically be checked in its material activities and become pacified.**

### Purport

It may be argued that even while closing one’s eyes, while dreaming or while living in a solitary place, one may remember or contemplate sense gratification. Such an experience, however, is due to previous sense gratification that one repeatedly saw and heard about. When one restricts the senses from their objects, especially from intimate contact with women, the mind’s material propensity will slacken and, like a fire without fuel, eventually die.

### Translation

**Therefore one should never let his senses associate freely with women or with men attached to women. Even those who are highly learned cannot trust the six enemies of the mind; what to speak, then, of foolish persons like me.**

His illusion cleansed away by transcendental knowledge, he understood Me to be the Supreme Soul within his heart and so at last achieved peace.**

### Translation

### Purport

Devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is so pleasing that a pure devotee cannot desire anything except service to the Lord. In the Tenth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* Lord Kṛṣṇa told the *gopīs* that they would have to accept their own service as the ultimate reward of their devotion to Him, since nothing awards as much happiness and knowledge as devotional service itself. When one sincerely chants and hears the holy name and fame of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the heart is purified and gradually one can appreciate the actual, blissful nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, loving service to the Lord.

### Translation

**Just as cold, fear and darkness are eradicated for one who has approached the sacrificial fire, so dullness, fear and ignorance are destroyed for one engaged in serving the devotees of the Lord.**

### Purport

Those engaged in fruitive activities are certainly dull; they lack higher awareness of the Supreme Lord and the soul. Materialists are engaged more or less mechanically in gratifying their senses and ambitions, and thus they are considered dull or practically unconscious. All such dullness, fear and ignorance are removed when one serves the lotus feet of the Lord, just as cold, fear and darkness are removed when one approaches a fire.

Those fearful of being dragged down by material lust and anger should take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord’s devotees, who can engage one safely in the Lord’s loving service.

### Synonyms

*santaḥ* — the devotees; *diśanti* — bestow; *cakṣūṁṣi* — eyes; *bahiḥ* — external; *arkaḥ* — the sun; *samutthitaḥ* — when it is fully risen; *devatāḥ* — worshipable deities; *bāndhavāḥ* — relatives; *santaḥ* — the devotees; *santaḥ* — the devotees; *ātmā* — one’s very soul; *aham* — Myself; *eva* *ca* — as well.

### Translation

**My devotees bestow divine eyes, whereas the sun allows only external sight, and that only when it is risen in the sky. My devotees are one’s real worshipable deities and real family; they are one’s own self, and ultimately they are nondifferent from Me.**

### Purport

Foolishness is the wealth of the impious, who place great value on their treasure and firmly make up their minds to remain in the darkness of ignorance. Saintly devotees of the Lord are just like the sun. By the light of their words, the living entities’ eyes of knowledge are opened and the darkness of ignorance is destroyed. Thus the saintly devotees are one’s real friends and relatives. They are the proper recipients of service — not the gross material body, which merely clamors for sense gratification.
