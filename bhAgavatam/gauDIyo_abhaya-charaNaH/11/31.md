CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE

This chapter describes the return of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His own abode, along with all the Yadus.

Upon learning from Dāruka that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa had returned to His abode, Vasudeva and all the others remaining in Dvārakā became very much agitated by lamentation and went out from the city to find Him. All the demigods who, in pursuance of the desire of Lord Kṛṣṇa, had taken birth in the Yadu dynasty to render assistance in His pastimes followed Lord Kṛṣṇa and returned to their respective abodes. The Lord’s activities of creating a life for Himself and then dismantling it are simply tricks of Māyā, like an actor’s performance. Actually, He creates the entire universe, and then He enters within it as the Supersoul. In the end, He again winds up the entire universe within Himself and, remaining in His private glory, desists from external pastimes.

Though overcome by feelings of separation from Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna was nevertheless able to pacify himself by remembering all the various instructions given to him by the Lord. Arjuna then carried out the rituals of offering *piṇḍa* and so on for his dead relatives. At that time the ocean swallowed up all of Dvārakā-purī except for the Lord’s own residence. Arjuna took the remaining members of the Yadu dynasty to Indraprastha, where he installed Vajra upon the throne. Hearing of these events, the Pāṇḍavas, led by Yudhiṣṭhira, placed Parīkṣit upon their throne and left for the great journey.

### Synonyms

*bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *pitāmaham* — Lord Brahmā; *vīkṣya* — seeing; *vibhūtīḥ* — the powerful expansions, the demigods; *ātmanaḥ* — His own; *vibhuḥ* — the Almighty Lord; *saṁyojya* — fixing; *ātmani* — in Himself; *ca* — and; *ātmānam* — His consciousness; *padma*-*netre* — His lotus eyes; *nyamīlyat* — closed.

### Translation

**Seeing before Him Brahmā, the grandfather of the universe, along with the other demigods, who are all His personal and powerful expansions, the Almighty Lord closed His lotus eyes, fixing His mind within Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, Lord Kṛṣṇa had previously answered the prayers of Lord Brahmā and the other demigods, who had requested the Lord to descend within this universe for the protection of His servants, the demigods. Now the demigods arrived before the Lord, each one desiring to take the Lord to his own planet. To avoid these innumerable social obligations, the Lord closed His eyes as if absorbed in *samādhi.*

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī adds that Lord Kṛṣṇa closed His eyes to instruct the *yogīs* how to leave this mortal world without attachment to one’s mystic opulences. All the demigods, including Brahmā, are mystic expansions of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and yet the Lord closed His eyes to emphasize that one should fix one’s mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead when departing from this world.

लोकाभिरामां स्वतनुं धारणाध्यानमङ्गलम् ।

### Verse text

*lokābhirāmāṁ sva-tanuṁ  
dhāraṇā-dhyāna-maṅgalam  
yoga-dhāraṇayāgneyyā-  
dagdhvā dhāmāviśat svakam*

### Synonyms

*loka* — to all the worlds; *abhirāmām* — most attractive; *sva*-*tanum* — His own transcendental body; *dhāraṇā* — of all trance; *dhyāna* — and meditation; *maṅgalam* — the auspicious object; *yoga*-*dhāraṇayā* — by mystic trance; *āgneyyā* — focused on fire; *adagdhvā* — without burning; *dhāma* — the abode; *āviśat* — He entered; *svakam* — His own.

### Translation

**Without employing the mystic āgneyī meditation to burn up His transcendental body, which is the all-attractive resting place of all the worlds and the object of all contemplation and meditation, Lord Kṛṣṇa entered into His own abode.**

### Purport

A *yogī* empowered to select the moment of leaving his body can cause it to burst into flames by engaging in the yogic meditation called *āgneyī,* and thus he passes into his next life. The demigods similarly employ this mystic fire when being transferred to the spiritual world. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely different from conditioned souls like *yogīs* and demigods, since the Lord’s eternal, spiritual body is the source of all existence, as indicated here by the words *lokābhirāmāṁ sva-tanum.* Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body is the source of pleasure for the entire universe. The word *dhāraṇā-dhyāna-maṅgalam* indicates that those trying for spiritual elevation through meditation and *yoga* achieve all auspiciousness through meditation on the Lord’s body. Since *yogīs* are liberated simply by thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s body, that body is certainly not material and therefore not subject to burning by mundane mystic fire or any other type of fire.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura reminds us of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statement in the Eleventh Canto, Chapter Fourteen, verse 37: *vahni-madhye smared rūpaṁ mamaitad dhyāna-maṅgalam.* “Within the fire one should meditate upon My form, which is the auspicious object of all meditation.” Since Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental form is present within fire as the maintaining principle, how can fire affect that form? Thus although the Lord appeared to enter the mystic *yoga* trance, the word *adagdhvā* indicates that the Lord, since His body is purely spiritual, bypassed the formality of burning and directly entered His own abode in the spiritual sky. This point has also been elaborately explained by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī in his commentary to this verse.

### Translation

**Just as ordinary men cannot ascertain the path of a lightning bolt as it leaves a cloud, the demigods could not trace out the movements of Lord Kṛṣṇa as He returned to His abode.**

### Purport

The sudden movements of a lightning bolt are seen by the demigods but not by human beings. Similarly, the sudden departure of Lord Kṛṣṇa could be understood by the Lord’s intimate associates in the spiritual sky but not by the demigods.

### Translation

### Purport

Although the demigods are virtually omniscient within this universe, they could not understand the movements of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mystic potency. Thus they were astonished.

### Translation

**My dear King, you should understand that the Supreme Lord’s appearance and disappearance, which resemble those of embodied conditioned souls, are actually a show enacted by His illusory energy, just like the performance of an actor. After creating this universe He enters into it, plays within it for some time, and at last winds it up. Then the Lord remains situated in His own transcendental glory, having ceased from the functions of cosmic manifestation.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the so-called fight among the members of the Yadu dynasty was actually a display of the pastime potency of the Lord, since Lord Kṛṣṇa’s personal associates are never subject to ordinary birth and death like conditioned souls. This being the case, certainly the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself is transcendental to material birth and death, as clearly stated in this verse.

The word *naṭasya,* “of an actor or magician,” is significant here. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura tells the following story of a certain magician who exhibits the trick of dying:

“In front of a great king, a magician approaches a stack of valuable garments, jewels, coins and so forth, all placed there by the king. Taking a jeweled necklace, the magician tells the king, ‘Now I am taking this necklace, and you can’t have it,’ and he makes the necklace disappear. ‘Now I’m taking this gold coin, and you can’t have it,’ he says, and makes the gold coin disappear. Next, challenging the king in the same way, the magician makes seven thousand horses disappear. Then the magician creates the illusion that the king’s children, grandchildren, brothers and other family members have attacked each other and that nearly all are dead from the violent quarrel. The king hears the magician speaking and at the same time observes these things taking place before him as he sits in the great assembly hall.

“Then the magician says, ‘O King, I no longer wish to live. Just as I have studied magic, so also, by the mercy of the lotus feet of my *guru,* I have learned the mystic meditation of *yoga.* One is supposed to give up one’s body while meditating in a holy place, and since you have performed so many pious activities, you are a holy place yourself. Therefore I shall now give up my body.’

“Thus speaking, the magician sits down in the proper *yoga* posture, fixes himself in *prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna* and *samādhi,* and becomes silent. A moment later, a fire generated from his trance blazes forth out of his body and burns it to ashes. Then all the wives of the magician, distraught with lamentation, enter into that fire.

“Three or four days later, after the magician has returned to his own province, he sends one of his daughters to the king. The daughter tells him, ‘O King, I have just come to your palace, bringing along with me, invisibly, all your sons, grandsons and brothers in good health — along with all the jewels and other items given by you. Please, therefore, give me whatever you consider fitting remuneration for the wisdom of the magic that has been exhibited before you.’ In this way, even by ordinary magic one can simulate birth and death.”

It is not difficult to understand, therefore, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although transcendental to the laws of nature, exhibits His illusory potency so that ordinary fools will think the Lord has left His body like a human being. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa returned to His abode in His own eternal body, as confirmed throughout the Vedic literature.

### Synonyms

*martyena* — in the same human body; *yaḥ* — who; *guru*-*sutam* — the son of His spiritual master; *yama*-*loka* — to the planet of Yamarāja; *nītam* — brought; *tvām* — you; *ca* — and; *ānayat* — brought back; *śaraṇa*-*daḥ* — the giver of shelter; *parama*-*astra* — by the supreme weapon, the *brahmāstra*; *dagdham* — burned; *jigye* — He conquered; *antaka* — of the agents of death; *antakam* — who is the death; *api* — even; *īśam* — Lord Śiva; *asau* — He, Kṛṣṇa; *anīśaḥ* — incapable; *kim* — whether; *sva* — of Himself; *avane* — in the protection; *svaḥ* — to the spiritual world; *anayat* — brought; *mṛgayum* — the hunter; *sa*-*deham* — in the same body.

### Translation

**Lord Kṛṣṇa brought the son of His guru back from the planet of the lord of death in the boy’s selfsame body, and as the ultimate giver of protection He saved you also when you were burned by the brahmāstra of Aśvatthāmā. He conquered in battle even Lord Śiva, who deals death to the agents of death, and He sent the hunter Jarā directly to Vaikuṇṭha in his human body. How could such a personality be unable to protect His own Self?**

### Purport

To mitigate his own and Parīkṣit Mahārāja’s distress at the narration of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s departure from this world, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī here gives several clear examples proving that Lord Kṛṣṇa is far beyond the influence of death. Although the son of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s spiritual master (Sāndīpani Muni) had been taken by death, the Lord brought him back in his same body. Similarly, the power of Brahman cannot touch Lord Kṛṣṇa, since Parīkṣit Mahārāja, though burned by the *brahmāstra* weapon, was easily saved by the Lord. Lord Śiva was clearly defeated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in the battle with Bāṇāsura, and the hunter Jarā was sent to a Vaikuṇṭha planet in his same human body. Death is an insignificant expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s external potency and cannot possibly act upon the Lord Himself. Those who actually understand the transcendental nature of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s activities will find convincing evidence in these examples.

### Translation

**Although Lord Kṛṣṇa, being the possessor of infinite powers, is the only cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of innumerable living beings, He simply did not desire to keep His body in this world any longer. Thus He revealed the destination of those fixed in the self and demonstrated that this mortal world is of no intrinsic value.**

### Purport

Although Lord Kṛṣṇa descended to this world to save the fallen souls, He did not want to encourage people in the future to loiter here unnecessarily. In other words, as soon as possible one should perfect one’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead. If Lord Kṛṣṇa had remained longer on the earth, He would have unnecessarily increased the prestige of the material world.

As stated by Śrī Uddhava in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.2.11), *ādāyāntar adhād yas tu sva-bimbaṁ loka-locanam:* “Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who manifested His eternal form before the vision of all on the earth, performed His disappearance by removing His form from the sight of those who are unable to see Him \as He is\] due to not executing the required penance.” Uddhava also states in the [*Bhāgavatam* (3.2.10):

*devasya māyayā spṛṣṭā  
ye cānyad-asad-āśritāḥ  
bhrāmyate dhīr na tad-vākyair  
ātmany uptātmano harau*

“Under no circumstances can the words of persons bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord deviate the intelligence of those who are completely surrendered souls.” One who follows the Vaiṣṇava authorities in his attempt to understand Lord Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental disappearance easily appreciates that the Lord is the omnipotent Personality of Godhead and that His spiritual body is identical with His eternal spiritual potency.

### Purport

It is understood that the anguished scene described here is a display of the Lord’s illusory potency, adding a final dramatic note to Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes on the earth. In reality, Lord Kṛṣṇa returned to His eternal abode in His original body, and His eternal associates returned with Him. This final heartbreaking scene of the Lord’s pastimes is a creation of the Lord’s internal potency that brings the Lord’s manifest pastimes to a perfect dramatic end.

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, Arjuna remembered such verses from the *Gītā* as:

*nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya  
yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ  
mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti  
loko mām ajam avyayam*

(Bg. 7.25)

“I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency (*yoga-māyā*), and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.”

Similarly, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has mentioned the *Gītā* verse *mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo ’si me* (Bg. 18.65): “You will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.” He has also quoted from the *Svarga-parva* of the *Mahābhārata* as follows:

*dadarśa tatra govindaṁ  
brahmaṇe vapuṣānvitam  
tenaiva dṛṣṭa-pūrveṇa  
sādṛśyenopasūcitam*

*dīpyamānaṁ sva-vapuṣā  
divyair astrair upaskṛtam  
cakra-prabhṛtibhir ghorair  
divyaiḥ puruṣa-vigrahaiḥ*

*upāsyamānaṁ vīreṇa  
phālgunena su-varcasā  
yathā-svarūpaṁ kaunteya  
tathaiva madhusūdanam*

*tāv ubhau puruṣa-vyāghrau  
samudvīkṣya yudhiṣṭhiram  
yathārhaṁ pratipedāte  
pūjayā deva-pūjitau*

“There Yudhiṣṭhira saw Lord Govinda as the Absolute Truth in His original, personal form. He appeared just as Yudhiṣṭhira had seen Him before, with all the same characteristics. He was glowing brilliantly with the effulgence coming from His own body, and He was surrounded by His transcendental weapons — the disc and so on — which appeared in their fearsome personified forms. O descendant of Kuntī, Lord Madhusūdana was being worshiped by the effulgent hero Arjuna, who also appeared in his original form. When these two lions among men, who are worshipable by the demigods, noticed the presence of Yudhiṣṭhira, they approached him with proper respect and offered him worship.”

### Translation

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that whereas the external manifestation of the Lord’s abode was covered by the ocean, the Lord’s eternal Dvārakā exists beyond the material universe and certainly beyond the material ocean. Dvārakā had been constructed by Viśvakarmā, the architect of the demigods, and the Sudharmā assembly hall had been brought from heaven. In that city there were many beautiful and splendorous residences of the aristocratic Yadu dynasty, and the most beautiful residence of all was that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī mentions that even in the modern age, people who live near the site of the original Dvārakā sometimes catch a glimpse of it in the ocean. Ultimately, the Lord’s associates and abode are eternal, and one who understands this is qualified to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.
