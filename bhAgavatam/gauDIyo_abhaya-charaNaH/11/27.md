+++
CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN

In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead explains the process of *kriyā-yoga,* or Deity worship.

Worshiping the Deity form of the Supreme Lord automatically brings purity and satisfaction to the mind. Thus it is the source of all desirable gains. If a person has no engagement in Deity service he will simply remain attracted to material sense gratification, and he will have no hope of giving up bad association. The Personality of Godhead has given instruction, among the regulations of the *Sātvata* scriptures, on the process of worshiping Him as the bona fide Deity. Brahmā, Śiva, Nārada, Vyāsa and all other sages have recommended this process described by the Lord as most perfectly beneficial for all the occupational classes and spiritual orders of human society, including even the women and *śūdras.*

There are three varieties of *arcana,* Deity worship, based on either the original *Vedas,* the secondary *tantras,* or a combination of these. The Deity image, the ground, the fire, the sun, the water and the heart of the worshiper are all true locations of the Deity’s presence. The Deity form to be worshiped may be constructed of any one of eight substances — stone, wood, metal, clay, paint, sand (drawn upon the ground), the mind or jewels. These categories are further subdivided into two: temporary and permanent.

The details of the worshiping process are as follows: The devotee should bathe both physically and by chanting *mantras,* and then he should perform the utterance of Gāyatrī at the prescribed juncture of the day. He should arrange a seat facing either east or north, or else directly facing the Deity, and should bathe and clean the Deity. Then he should present clothing and ornaments, sprinkle water on the vessels and other paraphernalia to be used in the worship, and offer water for bathing the Deity’s feet, *arghya,* water for washing His mouth, fragrant oils, incense, lamps, flowers and food preparations. After this, one should worship the Lord’s personal servants and bodyguards, His consort energies, and the spiritual masters by chanting their respective *mūla-mantras.* The worshiper should recite prayers from the *Purāṇas* and other sources, offer obeisances flat on the ground, beg for benediction, and place on himself the remnants of the Lord’s garlands.

Included in this method of Deity worship are the proper installation of the transcendental Deity by constructing a fine temple, and also the conducting of processions and other festivals. By worshiping Lord Śrī Hari with unconditional devotion in this manner, one gains access to pure loving service to His lotus feet. But if one steals property that has been given as charity to the Deity or the *brāhmaṇas,* whether given by himself or by others, he will have to take his next birth as a stool-eating worm.

श्रीउद्धव उवाच  
क्रियायोगं समाचक्ष्व भवदाराधनं प्रभो ।  
यस्मात्त्वां ये यथार्चन्ति सात्वता- सात्वतर्षभ ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-uddhava uvāca  
*kriyā-yogaṁ samācakṣva  
bhavad-ārādhanaṁ prabho  
yasmāt tvāṁ ye yathārcanti  
sātvatāḥ sātvatarṣabha*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*uddhavaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Uddhava said; *kriyā*-*yogam* — the prescribed method of activity; *samācakṣva* — please explain; *bhavat* — of You; *ārādhanam* — the Deity worship; *prabho* — O Lord; *yasmāt* — based on what kind of form; *tvām* — You; *ye* — who; *yathā* — in what manner; *arcanti* — they worship; *sātvatāḥ* — the devotees; *sātvata*-*ṛṣabha* — O master of the devotees.

### Translation

**Śrī Uddhava said: My dear Lord, O master of the devotees, please explain to me the prescribed method of worshiping You in Your Deity form. What are the qualifications of those devotees who worship the Deity, on what basis is such worship established, and what is the specific method of worship?**

### Purport

In addition to performing their prescribed duties, devotees of the Lord engage in regulated worship of the Lord in His Deity form in the temple. Such worship acts powerfully to cleanse the heart of both the lust to enjoy one’s material body and the material family attachment that results directly from this lust. To be effective, however, the process of Deity worship must be performed in the authorized way. Therefore Uddhava now inquires from the Lord about this subject.

Then they were spoken by the great Lord Brahmā to his sons, headed by Bhṛgu, and by Lord Śiva to his wife, Pārvatī. This process is accepted by and appropriate for all the occupational and spiritual orders of society. Therefore I consider worship of You in Your Deity form to be the most beneficial of all spiritual practices, even for women and śūdras.**

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *na* — there is not; *hi* — indeed; *antaḥ* — any end; *ananta*-*pārasya* — of the boundless; *karma*-*kāṇḍasya* — Vedic prescriptions for the execution of worship; *ca* — and; *uddhava* — O Uddhava; *saṅkṣiptam* — in brief; *varṇayiṣyāmi* — I shall explain; *yathā*-*vat* — in a suitable manner; *anupūrvaśaḥ* — in the appropriate order.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Uddhava, there is no end to the innumerable Vedic prescriptions for executing Deity worship; so I shall explain this topic to you briefly, one step at a time.**

### Purport

Here the word *karma-kāṇḍa* refers to the various Vedic methods of worship, culminating in Deity worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as the means of sense gratification and material renunciation are innumerable, the transcendental pastimes and qualities the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoys in His own abode, called Vaikuṇṭha, are also innumerable. The various concepts of piety and methods of purification in the material world ultimately cannot be reconciled amongst themselves without accepting the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, since without appreciation of Him there is no definitive understanding of what is actually obligatory for a human being. Even though almost all human beings are engaged in various processes of worship, the Lord will now summarize this topic, describing how one should worship Him in His Deity form.

### Verse text

*vaidikas tāntriko miśra  
iti me tri-vidho makhaḥ  
trayāṇām īpsitenaiva  
vidhinā māṁ samarcaret*

### Synonyms

*vaidikaḥ* — according to the four *Vedas*; *tāntrikaḥ* — according to practical, explanatory literatures; *miśraḥ* — mixed; *iti* — thus; *me* — of Me; *tri*-*vidhaḥ* — of three kinds; *makhaḥ* — sacrifice; *trayāṇām* — of the three; *īpsitena* — that which one feels to be most suitable; *eva* — certainly; *vidhinā* — by the process; *mām* — Me; *samarcaret* — one should properly worship.

### Translation

**One should carefully worship Me by selecting one of the three methods by which I receive sacrifice: Vedic, tantric or mixed.**

### Purport

*Vaidika* refers to sacrifice performed with *mantras* from the four *Vedas* and auxiliary Vedic literature. *Tāntrika* refers to such literatures as the *Pañcarātra* and the *Gautamīya-tantra.* And “mixed” indicates utilization of both literatures. It should be remembered that superficial imitation of elaborate Vedic sacrifices will not bring one the actual perfection of life. One must perform sacrifice according to the prescription of the Supreme Lord, who recommends for this age the chanting of His holy names: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

### Verse text

### Synonyms

*yadā* — when; *sva* — specified according to one’s qualification; *nigamena* — by the *Vedas*; *uktam* — enjoined; *dvijatvam* — the status of becoming twice-born; *prāpya* — achieving; *pūruṣaḥ* — a person; *yathā* — in which way; *yajeta* — he should execute worship; *mām* — unto Me; *bhaktyā* — with devotion; *śraddhayā* — with faith; *tat* — that; *nibodha* — please hear; *me* — from Me.

### Translation

**Now please listen faithfully as I explain exactly how a person who has achieved twice-born status through the relevant Vedic prescriptions should worship Me with devotion.**

### Purport

The word *sva-nigamena* refers to the particular Vedic injunctions relevant to one’s social and occupational status. Members of the *brāhmaṇa,* *kṣatriya* and *vaiśya* communities all achieve *dvijatvam,* twice-born status, by initiation into the Gāyatrī *mantra.* Traditionally, fully qualified *brāhmaṇa* boys may be initiated at age eight, *kṣatriyas* at eleven and *vaiśyas* at twelve, provided the proper conditions are met. Having achieved twice-born status, one should faithfully worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of the Deity, as the Lord Himself will describe.

*śailī dāru-mayī lauhī  
lepyā lekhyā ca saikatī  
mano-mayī maṇi-mayī  
pratimāṣṭa-vidhā smṛtā*

### Synonyms

*śailī* — made of stone; *dāru*-*mayī* — made of wood; *lauhī* — made of metal; *lepyā* — made of clay, sandalwood and other substances laid down as a paste; *lekhyā* — painted; *ca* — and; *saikatī* — made of sand; *manaḥ*-*mayī* — conceived of in the mind; *maṇi*-*mayī* — made of jewels; *pratimā* — the Deity; *aṣṭa*-*vidhā* — in eight varieties; *smṛtā* — it is remembered.

### Translation

**The Deity form of the Lord is said to appear in eight varieties — stone, wood, metal, earth, paint, sand, the mind or jewels.**

### Purport

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that certain Deity forms, such as those made of sand, are manifested for a brief time to fulfill a personal desire of the worshiper. Those, however, who desire to attain pure love of God should worship the permanent form of the Deity (made, for instance, of marble, gold or brass), and they should maintain continual worship. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no scope for neglecting the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

चलाचलेति द्विविधा प्रतिष्ठा जीवमन्दिरम् ।

### Verse text

*calācaleti dvi-vidhā  
pratiṣṭhā jīva-mandiram  
udvāsāvāhane na staḥ  
sthirāyām uddhavārcane*

### Synonyms

*calā* — movable; *acalā* — immovable; *iti* — thus; *dvi*-*vidhā* — of two varieties; *pratiṣṭhā* — the installation; *jīva*-*mandiram* — of the Deity, who is the shelter of all living entities; *udvāsa* — sending away; *āvāhane* — and calling forth; *na* *staḥ* — are not done; *sthirāyām* — for the permanently established Deity; *uddhava* — My dear Uddhava; *arcane* — in His worship.

### Translation

**The Deity form of the Lord, who is the shelter of all living entities, can be established in two ways: temporarily or permanently. But a permanent Deity, having been called, can never be sent away, My dear Uddhava.**

### Purport

The devotees of the Lord understand themselves to be the Lord’s eternal servitors; recognizing the Deity to be the Lord Himself, they permanently install the Deity and engage in perpetual worship. The impersonalists, however, regard the eternal form of the Lord as a temporary manifestation of illusion. In fact, they regard the Deity form as a mere stepping-stone in their ambitious program to become God. Materialistic persons of whatever stripe consider the Lord to be their order supplier, and so they make temporary arrangements for religious ceremonies to achieve temporary material sense gratification. This temporary mode of worship is favored by those desiring to exploit the Personality of Godhead for their personal ends, whereas the loving devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness eternally engage in worship of the Personality of Godhead. They install permanent Deities meant to be worshiped perpetually.

### Devanagari

अस्थिरायां विकल्प- स्यात् स्थण्डिले तु भवेद् द्वयम् ।  
स्‍नपनं त्वविलेप्यायामन्यत्र परिमार्जनम् ॥ १४ ॥

### Verse text

*asthirāyāṁ vikalpaḥ syāt  
sthaṇḍile tu bhaved dvayam  
snapanaṁ tv avilepyāyām  
anyatra parimārjanam*

### Synonyms

*asthirāyām* — in the case of the temporarily installed Deity; *vikalpaḥ* — an option (as to whether the Deity is to be called and sent away); *syāt* — there is; *sthaṇḍile* — in the case of the Deity traced upon the ground; *tu* — but; *bhavet* — do occur; *dvayam* — these two rituals; *snapanam* — the bathing; *tu* — but; *avilepyāyām* — in the case when the Deity is not made out of clay (or paint or wood); *anyatra* — in the other cases; *parimārjanam* — thorough cleansing, but without water.

### Translation

**The Deity that is temporarily established can optionally be called forth and sent away, but these two rituals should always be performed when the Deity is traced upon the ground. Bathing should be done with water except if the Deity is made of clay, paint or wood, in which cases a thorough cleansing without water is enjoined.**

### Purport

Various classes of devotees worship the Deity of the Personality of Godhead according to their various stages of faith in the Lord. An advanced devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa understands his eternal loving relationship with the Lord and, seeing the Deity as the Lord Himself, establishes an eternal relationship with the Deity based on loving servitude to Him. Understanding Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the eternal form of bliss and knowledge, a faithful devotee makes a permanent arrangement for Deity worship, installing the Lord’s form made of, for example, stone, wood or marble.

The *śālagrāma-śilā* is considered to be automatically installed even without the formal ceremony, and so it is forbidden to call the Deity with *mantras* or ask the Deity to leave. On the other hand, if one prepares a Deity form by drawing on sanctified ground or by constructing a sand image, one must call the Deity with *mantras* and then ask the Deity to leave the external form, which will soon be demolished by the natural elements.

The general principle is that a pure devotee of the Lord understands his relationship with the Deity to be eternal. The more one surrenders in loving devotion to the Deity, the more one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa is a person, but He is the Supreme Person, possessing His own unique feelings. One can easily please the Lord by devotional service offered to His Deity form. By pleasing the Lord one can gradually progress in the mission of human life and eventually go back home, back to Godhead, where the Deity personally appears before the devotee and welcomes the devotee to His personal abode, known throughout the world as the kingdom of God.

द्रव्यै- प्रसिद्धैर्मद्याग- प्रतिमादिष्वमायिन- ।

### Verse text

*dravyaiḥ prasiddhair mad-yāgaḥ  
pratimādiṣv amāyinaḥ  
bhaktasya ca yathā-labdhair  
hṛdi bhāvena caiva hi*

### Synonyms

*dravyaiḥ* — with items of paraphernalia; *prasiddhaiḥ* — excellent; *mat*-*yāgaḥ* — My worship; *pratimā*-*ādiṣu* — in the different Deity forms; *amāyinaḥ* — who has no material desire; *bhaktasya* — of a devotee; *ca* — and; *yathā*-*labdhaiḥ* — by whatever paraphernalia he can easily obtain; *hṛdi* — in the heart; *bhāvena* — by mental conception; *ca* — and; *eva* *hi* — certainly.

### Translation

**One should worship Me in My Deity forms by offering the most excellent paraphernalia. But a devotee completely freed from material desire may worship Me with whatever he is able to obtain, and may even worship Me within his heart with mental paraphernalia.**

### Purport

A devotee still troubled by material desire tends to see the world as an object of sense gratification. Such a neophyte devotee may misunderstand the Lord’s supreme position and may even consider the Lord an object of his own enjoyment. Hence the neophyte must offer opulent paraphernalia to the Deity so that he may constantly remember that the Deity is the supreme enjoyer and that he, the neophyte, is simply the worshiper and is actually meant for the Deity’s pleasure. In contrast, an advanced devotee, one fixed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, never forgets that the Supreme Lord is the actual enjoyer and controller of everything. The pure devotee offers his unalloyed love to the Personality of Godhead along with whatever paraphernalia is easily obtained. A Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee does not waver in his devotion to Lord Kṛṣṇa, and even with the simplest offering he completely satisfies the Personality of Godhead.

### Synonyms

*snāna* — bathing; *alaṅkaraṇam* — and decorating with clothing and ornaments; *preṣṭham* — is most appreciated; *arcāyām* — for the Deity form; *eva* — certainly; *tu* — and; *uddhava* — O Uddhava; *sthaṇḍile* — for the Deity drawn upon the ground; *tattva*-*vinyāsaḥ* — establishing the expansions and potencies of the Lord within the various limbs of the Deity by chanting the respective *mantras*; *vahnau* — for the sacrificial fire; *ājya* — in ghee; *plutam* — drenched; *haviḥ* — the oblations of sesame, barley and so on; *sūrye* — for the sun; *ca* — and; *abhyarhaṇam* — the *yoga* meditation of twelve *āsanas* and offerings of *arghya*; *preṣṭham* — most dear; *salile* — for the water; *salila*-*ādibhiḥ* — by offerings of water and so on; *śraddhayā* — with faith; *upāhṛtam* — presented; *preṣṭham* — most dear; *bhaktena* — by the devotee; *mama* — My; *vāri* — water; *api* — even.

### Translation

**In worshiping the temple Deity, my dear Uddhava, bathing and decoration are the most pleasing offerings. For the Deity traced on sacred ground, the process of tattva-vinyāsa is most dear. Oblations of sesame and barley soaked in ghee are the preferred offering to the sacrificial fire, whereas worship consisting of upasthāna and arghya is preferred for the sun. One should worship Me in the form of water by offering water itself. Actually, whatever is offered to Me with faith by My devotee — even if only a little water — is most dear to Me.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present everywhere, and Vedic culture prescribes various ritualistic methods for worshiping the Lord in His various manifestations. The principal item is the faith and devotion of the worshiper, without which everything else is useless, as the Lord describes in the next verse.

### Verse text

*bhūry apy abhaktopāhṛtaṁ  
na me toṣāya kalpate  
gandho dhūpaḥ sumanaso  
dīpo ’nnādyaṁ ca kiṁ punaḥ*

### Synonyms

*bhūri* — opulent; *api* — even; *abhakta* — by a nondevotee; *upāhṛtam* — offered; *na* — does not; *me* — My; *toṣāya* — satisfaction; *kalpate* — create; *gandhaḥ* — fragrance; *dhūpaḥ* — incense; *sumanasaḥ* — flowers; *dīpaḥ* — lamps; *anna*-*ādyam* — foodstuffs; *ca* — and; *kim* *punaḥ* — what to speak of.

### Translation

**Even very opulent presentations do not satisfy Me if they are offered by nondevotees. But I am pleased by any insignificant offering made by My loving devotees, and I am certainly most pleased when nice presentations of fragrant oil, incense, flowers and palatable foods are offered with love.**

### Purport

The Lord has stated in the previous verse that even a little water offered with love and devotion gives Him great pleasure. Therefore the words *kiṁ punaḥ* indicate the Lord’s complete happiness when a suitably opulent offering is made with love and devotion. But an opulent offering made by a nondevotee cannot please the Lord. As Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains, the rules and regulations concerning Deity worship and the listing of offenses against the Deities are all meant for helping one avoid precisely this kind of disrespectful or neglectful attitude toward the Personality of Godhead in His Deity form. In fact, all offenses against the Deity are based upon irreverence and disregard for the Lord’s position as master, and thus upon disobedience to His orders. Since one must worship the Deity with reverence, one should offer opulent presentations to the Deity with love, for such presentations both enhance the respectfulness of the worshiper and help him avoid offenses in his worship.

### Purport

The body of a devotee is pervaded by the Supreme Lord just as a house is pervaded by the glow of a lamp. Just as one gestures in a friendly way to indicate that a guest should enter one’s house, one touches the body of the Deity, chants appropriate *mantras,* and enthusiastically invites the Supersoul to enter the form of the Deity. Since both the Deity and the Supersoul are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not different. One form of the Lord can immediately become manifest in another.

Then, following the regulations of both the Vedas and the tantras, he should offer Me water for washing the feet, water for washing the mouth, arghya and other items of worship. By this process he achieves both material enjoyment and liberation.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, religion, knowledge, renunciation and opulence are the legs of the Lord’s sitting platform and occupy the four corners, beginning with the southeast.

### Synonyms

*durgām* — the Lord’s spiritual energy; *vināyakam* — the original Gaṇeśa; *vyāsam* — the compiler of the *Vedas*; *viṣvaksenam* — Viṣvaksena; *gurūn* — one’s spiritual masters; *surān* — the demigods; *sve* *sve* — each in his own; *sthāne* — place; *tu* — and; *abhimukhān* — all facing the Deity; *pūjayet* — one should worship; *prokṣaṇa*-*ādibhiḥ* — by the various prescriptions beginning with sprinkling of water for purification.

### Translation

**With offerings such as prokṣaṇa one should worship Durgā, Vināyaka, Vyāsa, Viṣvaksena, the spiritual masters and the various demigods. All these personalities should be in their proper places facing the Deity of the Lord.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the Gaṇeśa and Durgā mentioned in this verse are not the same personalities present within the material world; rather, they are eternal associates of the Lord in Vaikuṇṭha. In this world Gaṇeśa, the son of Lord Śiva, is famous for awarding financial success, and the goddess Durgā, the wife of Lord Śiva, is famous as the external, illusory potency of the Supreme Lord. The personalities mentioned here, however, are eternally liberated associates of the Lord who reside in the spiritual sky, beyond the material manifestation. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī quotes from various Vedic literatures to prove that the name Durgā may also indicate the *internal* potency of the Lord, who is nondifferent from Him. The external, or covering, potency of the Lord expands from this original Durgā. The Durgā of the material world, called Mahā-māyā, assumes the function of bewildering the living entities. Thus a devotee should not fear becoming polluted by worshiping the Durgā mentioned here, who has the same name as illusion, but rather the devotee must show respect to these eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord in Vaikuṇṭha.

You should mentally worship Him and meditate upon Him while you walk, while you stand, while you sleep and eat. You should see the Deity in front of you, behind, above, below and on both sides. In this way you should constantly remember My Deity form.” In the *Gautamīya-tantra* one is enjoined to give the Deity of the Lord a *brāhmaṇa* thread, if possible one made of gold. In the *Nṛsiṁha Purāṇa* it is stated, “If one offers to Lord Govinda a yellow sacred thread containing three strands of silk, he will become an expert in *Vedānta.*”

Next one should offer valuable silk garments and jeweled ornaments to the Deity, smear His body with sandalwood paste, and offer Him garlands and other gifts. After this, one should hold a mirror in front of the Deity and then offer fragrant oil, flowers, incense, lamps and scented water for refreshing the mouth. One should offer all types of palatable foods, fragrant water, betel nuts, garlands, *ārati* lamps, a bed to rest on, and so on. One should also fan the Deity and perform instrumental music, singing and dancing. This Deity worship must be performed on special occasions like religious holidays or else, if one can afford it, daily.” According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, Ekādaśī is an appropriate day for performing special Deity worship.

His helmet, bracelets, belt and fine arm ornaments shine brilliantly. The symbol of Śrīvatsa is on His chest, along with the glowing Kaustubha gem and a garland of forest flowers. The devotee should then worship that Lord by taking pieces of firewood soaked in the sacrificial ghee and throwing them into the fire. He should perform the ritual of āghāra, presenting into the fire the various items of oblation drenched in ghee. He should then offer to sixteen demigods, beginning with Yamarāja, the oblation called sviṣṭi-kṛt, reciting the basic mantras of each deity and the sixteen-line Puruṣa-sūkta hymn. Pouring one oblation after each line of the Puruṣa-sūkta, he should utter the particular mantra naming each deity.**

The word *muhūrtam,* “for some time,” indicates that a devotee should be careful not to neglect his regulative principles and service to the Lord in the name of so-called ecstasy. Although one may be ecstatically engaged in chanting, hearing and dancing, he cannot give up the formality of regulated service to the Lord.

### Translation

**Whenever one develops faith in Me — in My form as the Deity or in other bona fide manifestations — one should worship Me in that form. I certainly exist both within all created beings and also separately in My original form, since I am the Supreme Soul of all.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped according to the faith of a particular worshiper. The Deity form, *arcā,* is specifically mentioned here because Deity worship is essential for spiritual progress. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura mentions that inexperienced persons may think that the Deity is meant for the sense gratification of the worshiper, since superficially the Deity is made of external substances such as marble or brass. But through the process of installing the Deity by chanting of authorized *mantras,* one invites the Supreme Personality of Godhead to enter the Deity form. By regulated, faithful worship one gradually understands that the Deity is completely nondifferent from the Supreme Lord Himself. At that stage, on the strength of Deity worship, one rises to the second-class platform of devotional service. At this more developed stage one desires to make friendship with other devotees of the Lord, and as one becomes solidly established in the community of Vaiṣṇavas, one completely gives up material life and gradually becomes perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
