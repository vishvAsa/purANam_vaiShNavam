CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

Previously, the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, had assumed the form of Haṁsa and glorified the duties of the *brahmacārī* and *gṛhastha* orders. In this present chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa further describes these matters to Uddhava.

After Uddhava inquires from Śrī Kṛṣṇa about the duties of the social and religious orders of the *varṇāśrama* society, the Lord replies that in the first age, Satya-yuga, there was only one social order, called *haṁsa.* In that age men were automatically dedicated to pure devotional service from their very birth, and since everyone was perfect in all respects, the age was called Kṛta-yuga. The *Vedas* were then manifest in the form of the sacred syllable *om,* and the Supreme Lord was perceived within the mind in the form of the four-legged bull of religion. There were no formalized processes of sacrifice, and the sinless people, who were naturally inclined to austerity, simply engaged in meditation on the personal form of the Lord. In the following age, Tretā-yuga, there became manifest from the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the three *Vedas,* and from them the three forms of the sacrificial fire. At that time the system of four *varṇas* and four *āśramas,* which prescribes material and spiritual duties for the different members of society, appeared from the bodily limbs of the Lord. According to how the social divisions took birth from higher and lower features of the Lord’s body, they became endowed with higher and lower qualities. After this description, Lord Kṛṣṇa explains the natures of persons in each of the four *varṇas* and of those who are outside the limits of the *varṇas.* He also describes those qualities that pertain to humanity in general.

Members of the higher orders are qualified to accept second birth. After receiving the sacred thread initiation, they should go to live in the *gurukula,* the home of the spiritual master. With a pacified mind, the student (*brahmacārī*) should absorb himself in study of the *Vedas.* He should keep matted hair and is forbidden to wash his teeth, prepare a nice seat for himself, talk when bathing or evacuating, cut his hair and nails or at any time pass semen. He must regularly perform worship at the three junctures of the day and must render devotional service to his spiritual master in a spirit free from envy. The *brahmacārī* must offer to the *guru* whatever food and other things he obtains by begging. He accepts for his maintenance whatever remnants of the Lord he is granted. He should render menial service to the spiritual master by massaging his feet and worshiping him and should avoid all sense gratification and strictly maintain the vow of celibacy. With his mind, body and words, he should worship the Supreme Lord in the form of the Supersoul in the way prescribed for him. For *brahmacārīs,* seeing or touching women, and conversations or sports in the company of women, are absolutely disallowed. Cleanliness and ritual purification by water should be observed by members of all the spiritual orders of society. Everyone is also advised to always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Soul dwelling within the hearts of all.

After studying all the different aspects of the *Vedas,* a *brāhmaṇa* who has material desires may take permission from his spiritual master and enter family life. Otherwise, if he has no material desire, he may become a *vānaprastha* or *sannyāsī.* The proper order of succession should be followed in changing from one spiritual order to the next. One who wishes to enter the household order should accept a wife who is of the same social class, who is not objectionable, and who is somewhat younger in age than he.

The obligatory duties of the three classes who are twice-born — the *brāhmaṇas,* *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* — are worship of the Lord, study of the *Vedas* and giving charity. The occupational duties of accepting charity, teaching others and performing sacrifice for others are the privilege of the *brāhmaṇas* alone. If a *brāhmaṇa* considers that his consciousness is contaminated by engaging in these occupations, he may sustain his existence by collecting grains from the fields. If he is disturbed by poverty, the *brāhmaṇa* may out of necessity accept the business of a *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya,* but he should never take the occupation of a *śūdra.* In a similar situation, a *kṣatriya* may take the occupation of a *vaiśya,* and a *vaiśya* that of a *śūdra.* But when the emergency has passed, it is not fitting to continue earning one’s living by a lower occupation. A *brāhmaṇa* who is properly fixed in his personal duty rejects all insignificant material desires, always serves the Vaiṣṇavas and is under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The householder should study the *Vedas* every day and maintain his wards with money honestly earned by his own occupation. As far as possible, he should execute worship of the Lord by ritual sacrifices. Remaining unattached to material life and fixed in devotion to the Supreme Lord, the householder may finally take the order of *vānaprastha,* so that he can fully involve himself in the Lord’s worship. If he has a grown son, he may directly take the renounced order of *sannyāsa.* But persons who are excessively lusty after women, who have no proper discrimination, and who are extremely attached to wealth and possessions remain perpetually in anxiety over the welfare of their family members and are doomed to take their next birth in a lower species of life.

### Translation

**Śrī Uddhava said: My dear Lord, previously You described the principles of devotional service that are to be practiced by followers of the varṇāśrama system and even ordinary, unregulated human beings. My dear lotus-eyed Lord, now please explain to me how all human beings can achieve loving service unto You by the execution of their prescribed duties.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa has already elaborately explained the process of *jñāna-yoga, bhakti-yoga* and *aṣṭāṅga-yoga.* Now Uddhava inquires how those inclined toward *karma-yoga* can achieve the perfection of life, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.13) Lord Kṛṣṇa describes that He is personally the creator of the *varṇāśrama* system. *Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.* Therefore the ultimate goal of the *varṇāśrama* system is to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, one should become a devotee of the Lord and learn the process of pure devotional service. The easiest method of achieving pure devotional service is by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. If one submissively and faithfully associates with pure devotees, one can immediately achieve the perfection of life. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is not required to execute all the formalities of the *varṇāśrama* system, because a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, absorbed in love of Godhead, automatically gives up all sense gratification and mental speculation. Those human beings who do not follow the *varṇāśrama* system are here referred to as *dvi-padām,* or two-legged. In other words, one who does not follow the religious path of life is known to be human only by the possession of two legs. Even ordinary animals and insects are eagerly engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending; the human being, however, is distinguished from such lower forms of life by his capacity to become religious and, ultimately, to love God in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *dharmyaḥ* — faithful to religious principles; *eṣaḥ* — this; *tava* — your; *praśnaḥ* — question; *naiḥśreyasa*-*karaḥ* — the cause of pure devotional service; *nṛṇām* — for ordinary human beings; *varṇa*-*āśrama* — the *varṇāśrama* system; *ācāra*-*vatām* — for those who faithfully follow; *tam* — those highest religious principles; *uddhava* — My dear Uddhava; *nibodha* — please learn; *me* — from Me.

### Translation

### Purport

The word *naiḥśreyasa-kara* indicates that which awards the highest perfection of life, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which the Lord is explaining to Śrī Uddhava. When considering religious principles, ordinary human beings remain bogged down in sectarian mundane considerations. The process that awards the highest perfection of life should be considered the most auspicious for human beings. The *varṇāśrama* system is the most scientific presentation of religiosity on the earth, and those who are most perfect in that system come to the point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or dedicating everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.

आदौ कृतयुगे वर्णो नृणां हंस इति स्मृत- ।  
कृतकृत्या- प्रजा जात्या तस्मात् कृतयुगं विदु- ॥ १० ॥

### Verse text

*ādau kṛta-yuge varṇo  
nṛṇāṁ haṁsa iti smṛtaḥ  
kṛta-kṛtyāḥ prajā jātyā  
tasmāt kṛta-yugaṁ viduḥ*

### Synonyms

*ādau* — in the beginning (of the millennium); *kṛta*-*yuge* — in the Satya-yuga, or age of truth; *varṇaḥ* — the social class; *nṛṇām* — of human beings; *haṁsaḥ* — named *haṁsa*; *iti* — thus; *smṛtaḥ* — well known; *kṛta*-*kṛtyāḥ* — perfect in the execution of duties by complete surrender to the Supreme Lord; *prajāḥ* — the citizens; *jātyā* — automatically by birth; *tasmāt* — therefore; *kṛta*-*yugam* — Kṛta-yuga, or the age in which all duties are fulfilled; *viduḥ* — was thus known by the learned.

### Translation

**In the beginning, in Satya-yuga, there is only one social class, called haṁsa, to which all human beings belong. In that age all people are unalloyed devotees of the Lord from birth, and thus learned scholars call this first age Kṛta-yuga, or the age in which all religious duties are perfectly fulfilled.**

### Purport

It is understood from this verse that the supreme religious principle is unalloyed surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Satya-yuga there is no influence of the lower modes of nature, and therefore all human beings belong to the highest social order, called *haṁsa,* in which one comes under the direct supervision of the Personality of Godhead. In the modern age people are crying out for social equality, but unless all human beings are situated in the mode of goodness, which is the position of purity and unalloyed devotion, social equality is not possible. As the lower modes of nature become prominent, secondary religious principles arise, by which people may be gradually elevated to the pure stage of unalloyed surrender to God. In Satya-yuga there are no inferior human beings, and thus there is no need of secondary religious principles. Everyone directly takes to the unalloyed service of the Lord, fulfilling perfectly all religious obligations. In Sanskrit, one who perfectly executes all duties is called *kṛta-kṛtya,* as mentioned in this verse. Therefore Satya-yuga is called Kṛta-yuga, or the age of perfect religious action. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the word *ādau* (“in the beginning”) refers to the moment of universal creation. In other words, the *varṇāśrama* system is not a recent concoction but naturally arises at the time of creation and should therefore be accepted by all intelligent human beings.

*vedaḥ praṇava evāgre  
dharmo ’haṁ vṛṣa-rūpa-dhṛk  
upāsate tapo-niṣṭhā  
haṁsaṁ māṁ mukta-kilbiṣāḥ*

### Synonyms

*vedaḥ* — the *Veda*; *praṇavaḥ* — the sacred syllable *om*; *eva* — indeed; *agre* — in Satya-yuga; *dharmaḥ* — the object of mental activities; *aham* — I; *vṛṣa*-*rūpa*-*dhṛk* — bearing the form of the bull of religion; *upāsate* — they worship; *tapaḥ*-*niṣṭhāḥ* — fixed in austerity; *haṁsam* — Lord Haṁsa; *mām* — Me; *mukta* — freed from; *kilbiṣāḥ* — all sins.

### Translation

**In Satya-yuga the undivided Veda is expressed by the syllable om, and I am the only object of mental activities. I become manifest as the four-legged bull of religion, and thus the inhabitants of Satya-yuga, fixed in austerity and free from all sins, worship Me as Lord Haṁsa.**

### Purport

The bull of religion is described in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.17.24): *tapaḥ śaucaṁ dayā satyam iti pādāḥ kṛte kṛtāḥ.* “In the age of Satya \[truthfulness\], your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness.” Śrī Vyāsadeva divided the one *Veda* into four — the *Ṛg, Yajur, Sāma* and *Atharva Vedas* — at the end of Dvāpara-yuga, but in Satya-yuga the whole of Vedic knowledge is easily understood by everyone simply by vibrating the syllable *om.* In this age there are no ritualistic or pious activities such as sacrifice, since everyone is sinless, austere and fully engaged in worshiping the Personality of Godhead, Lord Haṁsa, through the process of meditation.

### Translation

**O greatly fortunate one, at the beginning of Tretā-yuga Vedic knowledge appeared from My heart, which is the abode of the air of life, in three divisions — as Ṛg, Sāma and Yajur. Then from that knowledge I appeared as threefold sacrifice.**

### Purport

In Tretā-yuga, the bull of religion loses one leg, and only seventy-five percent of religious principles are manifested, represented by the three principal *Vedas — Ṛg, Sāma* and *Yajur.* The Lord appears in the process of threefold Vedic sacrifice. The three divisions are understood as follows. The *hotā* priest offers oblations into the fire and chants the *Ṛg Veda;* the *udgātā* priest chants the *Sāma Veda;* and the *adhvaryu* priest, who arranges the sacrificial ground, altar, etc., chants the *Yajur Veda.* In Tretā-yuga such sacrifice is the authorized process for spiritual perfection. The word *prāṇāt* in this verse refers to the universal form of the Personality of Godhead. This form is further described in the following verses.

Each social division was recognized by its particular duties and behavior.**

### Translation

### Purport

There are two classes of *brahmacārī* life. The *naiṣṭhiki-brahmacārī* remains celibate throughout life, whereas the *upakurvāṇa-brahmacārī* marries upon finishing his student life. One who remains perpetually celibate is situated within the heart of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but those *brahmacārīs* who eventually marry are situated within the loins of the universal form of the Lord. The word *vane-vāsaḥ* refers to *vānaprastha,* or the retired order of life, which is situated on the chest of the Lord.

### Synonyms

*varṇānām* — of the occupational divisions; *āśramāṇām* — of the social divisions; *ca* — also; *janma* — of birth; *bhūmi* — the situation; *anusāriṇīḥ* — according to; *āsan* — appeared; *prakṛtayaḥ* — the natures; *nṝṇām* — of human beings; *nīcaiḥ* — by inferior background; *nīca* — inferior nature; *uttama* — by superior background; *uttamāḥ* — superior natures.

### Translation

**The various occupational and social divisions of human society appeared according to inferior and superior natures manifest in the situation of the individual’s birth.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the *brāhmaṇas* and *sannyāsīs,* being situated on the head of the universal form of the Lord, are considered to be the most qualified, whereas the *śūdras* and *gṛhasthas,* being on the legs or loins of the Personality of Godhead, are considered to be in the lowest position. A living entity is born with a certain amount of intelligence, beauty and social opportunity, and he is therefore situated in a particular occupational and social position within the *varṇāśrama* system. Ultimately, such positions are external designations, but since the majority of human beings are conditioned by the external energy of the Lord, they should act according to the scientific *varṇāśrama* divisions until they reach the stage of *jīvan-mukta,* or liberated life.

### Synonyms

*āstikyam* — faith in Vedic civilization; *dāna*-*niṣṭhā* — dedicated to charity; *ca* — also; *adambhaḥ* — being without hypocrisy; *brahma*-*sevanam* — service to the *brāhmaṇas*; *atuṣṭiḥ* — remaining dissatisfied; *artha* — of money; *upacayaiḥ* — by the accumulation; *vaiśya* — of the *vaiśyas*; *prakṛtayaḥ* — the natural qualities; *tu* — indeed; *imāḥ* — these.

### Translation

**Faith in Vedic civilization, dedication to charity, freedom from hypocrisy, service to the brāhmaṇas and perpetually desiring to accumulate more money are the natural qualities of the vaiśyas.**

### Purport

*Atuṣṭir arthopacayaiḥ* indicates that a *vaiśya* is never satisfied with any amount of wealth and always wants to accumulate more. On the other hand, he is *dāna-niṣṭha,* or dedicated to charitable work; *brahmasevī,* always engaged in assisting the *brāhmaṇas;* and *adambha,* free from hypocrisy. This is due to *āstikyam,* or complete faith in the Vedic way of life, and confidence that one will be rewarded or punished in the next life for one’s present activities. The fervent desire of the *vaiśyas* to accumulate wealth is not the same as ordinary material greed, because it is purified and tempered by the superior qualities mentioned in this verse.

### Purport

When the entire social order is functioning properly according to Vedic standards, everyone is happy and satisfied. Although the *śūdras* are to be satisfied with whatever income they obtain through their service, they never lack the necessities of life, because the other orders of society, such as *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas,* are required to be abundantly generous, and the *brāhmaṇas* are well known for being the most merciful of all. Therefore, if all social classes obey the Vedic injunctions there will be a new and blissful life for the entire human society under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**Dirtiness, dishonesty, thievery, faithlessness, useless quarrel, lust, anger and hankering constitute the nature of those in the lowest position outside the varṇāśrama system.**

### Purport

Here the Lord describes those who reside outside the scientific social system called *varṇāśrama.* In Europe and America, we have practically observed that the standards of cleanliness are abominable even among so-called educated persons. Going without bathing and the use of indecent language are common. In the modern age people whimsically speak whatever they like, dispensing with all authority, and there is therefore very little truthfulness or true wisdom. Similarly, in both the capitalistic and communistic countries, everyone is busily engaged in stealing and robbing from everyone else in the name of business, taxation or outright crime. People are not confident of the kingdom of God nor of their own eternal nature, and thus their faith is very weak. Moreover, since modern human beings are not very interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness they constantly quarrel, bicker and fight over completely insignificant issues relating to the material body. Thus at the slightest provocation there are huge wars and massacres. Lust, anger and hankering have become practically unlimited in Kali-yuga. The symptoms and characteristics mentioned here can be abundantly observed throughout the world, wherever people have fallen away from the *varṇāśrama* system. Because of sinful habits such as animal killing, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling, the great majority of human beings have become *caṇḍālas,* or untouchables.

### Purport

The word *sārva-varṇika* indicates that the above-mentioned principles constitute general piety, which should be observed by all members of society, even those outside the *varṇāśrama* system. We practically find that even in societies that have fallen away from the *varṇāśrama* system, the above-mentioned principles are honored and encouraged. Such principles do not constitute a specific path of liberation but are perennial virtues in human society.

*dvitīyaṁ prāpyānupūrvyāj

### Synonyms

*dvitīyam* — second; *prāpya* — achieving; *ānupūrvyāt* — by the gradual process of purificatory ceremonies; *janma* — birth; *upanayanam* — Gāyatrī initiation; *dvijaḥ* — a twice-born member of society; *vasan* — residing; *gurukule* — in the *āśrama* of the spiritual master; *dāntaḥ* — self-controlled; *brahma* — the Vedic literatures; *adhīyīta* — should study; *ca* — and also understand; *āhūtaḥ* — being summoned by the spiritual master.

### Translation

**The twice-born member of society achieves second birth through the sequence of purificatory ceremonies culminating in Gāyatrī initiation. Being summoned by the spiritual master, he should reside within the guru’s āśrama and with a self-controlled mind carefully study the Vedic literature.**

### Purport

The term *dvija,* or “twice-born,” here indicates the three superior classes, namely *brāhmaṇas,* *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas,* who all receive the Gāyatrī *mantra,* which signifies their second birth through spiritual initiation. One’s first birth is biological, or seminal, and does not necessarily indicate that one is intelligent or enlightened. A young *brāhmaṇa* boy, if qualified, may be initiated with Gāyatrī *mantra* at the age of twelve, and *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* a few years later. In order to become enlightened with spiritual knowledge, the boy resides within the *gurukula,* or *āśrama* of the spiritual master. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has established similar *gurukulas* all over the world and is issuing a great call to civilized human beings to arrange for the proper education of their children. Every young boy and girl should learn to be self-controlled and should become enlightened through study of authorized Vedic literatures. In this way, unlike ordinary animals, insects, fish and birds, etc., an enlightened human being may take birth twice and thus become perfect in the knowledge that leads to ultimate liberation. The word *ānupūrvyāt* in this verse indicates the system of *saṁskāras,* or purificatory rites, beginning with *garbhādhāna-saṁskāra,* or the purification of the sexual act. Generally, *śūdras* and those who do not follow the Vedic system are not attracted to such purificatory ceremonies; therefore they remain ignorant of spiritual life and envious of the bona fide spiritual master. Those whose character has been civilized by a systematic cleansing process give up the tendency to be argumentative and whimsical and instead become submissive and eager to learn in the presence of a bona fide spiritual master.

*mekhalā* — belt; *ajina* — deerskin; *daṇḍa* — staff; *akṣa* — bead necklace; *brahma*-*sūtra* — *brāhmaṇa* thread; *kamaṇḍalūn* — and waterpot; *jaṭilaḥ* — with matted, unruly hair; *adhauta* — without polishing, bleaching or ironing; *dat*-*vāsaḥ* — the teeth and clothes; *arakta*-*pīṭhaḥ* — without accepting a luxurious or sensuous seat; *kuśān* — *kuśa* grass; *dadhat* — carrying in his hand.

### Translation

**The brahmacārī should regularly dress with a belt of straw and deerskin garments. He should wear matted hair, carry a rod and waterpot and be decorated with akṣa beads and a sacred thread. Carrying pure kuśa grass in his hand, he should never accept a luxurious or sensuous sitting place. He should not unnecessarily polish his teeth, nor should he bleach and iron his clothes.**

### Purport

The word *adhauta-dad-vāsa* indicates that a renounced *brahmacārī* is not concerned with a glistening smile to attract the opposite sex, nor does he pay much attention to his outer garments. *Brahmacārī* life is meant for austerity and obedience to the spiritual master so that later in life, when one becomes a businessman, politician or intellectual *brāhmaṇa,* one will be able to call upon resources of character, discipline, self-control, austerity and humility. Student life, as described here, is far different from the mindless hedonism known as modern education. Of course, in the modern age, Kṛṣṇa conscious *brahmacārīs* cannot artificially adopt the ancient dress and ritualistic duties described here; but the essential values of self-control, purity and obedience to a bona fide spiritual master are just as necessary today as they were in Vedic times.

### Purport

This verse appears in *Caitanya-caritāmṛta* (*Ādi* 1.46). His Divine Grace Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Aṣṭottara-śata Śrī Śrīmad A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has commented on this verse as follows.

“This is a verse from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.17.27) spoken by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa when He was questioned by Uddhava regarding the four social and spiritual orders of society. He was specifically instructing how a *brahmacārī* should behave under the care of a spiritual master. A spiritual master is not an enjoyer of facilities offered by his disciples. He is like a parent. Without the attentive service of his parents, a child cannot grow to manhood; similarly, without the care of the spiritual master one cannot rise to the plane of transcendental service.

“The spiritual master is also called *ācārya,* or a transcendental professor of spiritual science. *Manu-saṁhitā* (2.140) explains the duties of an *ācārya,* describing that a bona fide spiritual maser accepts charge of disciples, teaches them the Vedic knowledge with all its intricacies, and gives them their second birth. The ceremony performed to initiate a disciple into the study of spiritual science is called *upanīti,* or the function that brings one nearer to the spiritual master. One who cannot be brought nearer to a spiritual master cannot have a sacred thread, and thus he is indicated to be a *śūdra.* The sacred thread worn on the body of a *brāhmaṇa,* *kṣatriya* or *vaiśya* is a symbol of initiation by the spiritual master; it is worth nothing if worn merely to boast of high parentage. The duty of the spiritual master is to initiate a disciple with the sacred thread ceremony, and after this *saṁskāra,* or purificatory process, the spiritual master actually begins to teach the disciple about the *Vedas.* A person born a *śūdra* is not barred from such spiritual initiation, provided he is approved by the spiritual master, who is duly authorized to award a disciple the right to be a *brāhmaṇa* if he finds him perfectly qualified. In the *Vāyu Purāṇa an ācārya* is defined as one who knows the import of all the Vedic literatures, explains the purpose of the *Vedas*, abides by their rules and regulations, and teaches his disciples to act in the same way.

“Only out of His immense compassion does the Personality of Godhead reveal Himself as the spiritual master. Therefore in the dealings of an *ācārya* there are no activities but those of transcendental loving service to the Lord. He is the Supreme Personality of Servitor Godhead. It is worthwhile to take shelter of such a steady devotee, who is called *āśraya-vigraha,* or the manifestation or form of the Lord of whom one must take shelter.

“If one poses himself as an *ācārya* but does not have an attitude of servitorship to the Lord, he must be considered an offender, and this offensive attitude disqualifies him from being an *ācārya.* The bona fide spiritual master always engages in unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By this test he is known to be a direct manifestation of the Lord and a genuine representative of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. Such a spiritual master is known as *ācāryadeva.* Influenced by an envious temperament and dissatisfied because of an attitude of sense gratification, mundaners criticize a real *ācārya.* In fact, however, a bona fide *ācārya* is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, and therefore to envy such an *ācārya* is to envy the Personality of Godhead Himself. This will produce an effect subversive to transcendental realization.

“As mentioned previously, a disciple should always respect the spiritual master as a manifestation of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but at the same time one should always remember that a spiritual master is never authorized to imitate the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. False spiritual masters pose themselves as identical with Śrī Kṛṣṇa in every respect, to exploit the sentiments of their disciples, but such impersonalists can only mislead their disciples, for their ultimate aim is to become one with the Lord. This is against the principles of the devotional cult.

“The real Vedic philosophy is *acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,* which establishes everything to be simultaneously one with and different from the Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī confirms that this is the real position of a bona fide spiritual master and says that one should always think of the spiritual master in terms of his intimate relationship with Mukunda (Śrī Kṛṣṇa). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, in his *Bhakti-sandarbha* (213), has clearly defined that a pure devotee’s observation of the spiritual master and Lord Śiva as one with the Personality of Godhead exists in terms of their being very dear to the Lord, not identical with Him in all respects. Following in the footsteps of Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī and Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, later *ācāryas* like Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura have confirmed the same truths. In his prayers to the spiritual master, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura confirms that all the revealed scriptures accept the spiritual master to be identical with the Personality of Godhead because he is a very dear and confidential servant of the Lord. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas therefore worship Śrīla Gurudeva (the spiritual master) in the light of his being the servitor of the Personality of Godhead. In all the ancient literatures of devotional service and in the more recent songs of Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and other unalloyed Vaiṣṇavas, the spiritual master is always considered to be either one of the confidential associates of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī or a manifested representation of Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu.”

### Translation

**In the morning and evening one should collect foodstuffs and other articles and deliver them to the spiritual master. Then, being self-controlled, one should accept for oneself that which is allotted by the ācārya.**

### Purport

One who desires to receive the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master should not be eager to accumulate the paraphernalia of sense gratification; rather, whatever one is able to collect one should offer at the lotus feet of the *ācārya.* Being self-controlled, one should humbly accept that which is allotted by the bona fide spiritual master. Every living entity must ultimately be trained to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but until one has become expert in the techniques of spiritual service one should offer everything to the spiritual master, who is completely realized in the process of worshiping the Lord. When the spiritual master sees that the disciple is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he then engages the disciple in directly worshiping the Personality of Godhead. A bona fide spiritual master does not use anything for his personal sense gratification and entrusts to his disciple only as much material opulence as the disciple can properly offer to the lotus feet of the Lord. The example may be given that when an ordinary father tries to train his son in business and other material activities, he entrusts to the son only as much wealth as the son can intelligently engage in profitable enterprises without foolishly wasting the father’s hard-earned money.

Similarly, the bona fide spiritual master teaches his disciple to worship the Lord, and an immature disciple must simply deliver everything to the lotus feet of the *guru,* just as an immature child does not keep a personal bank account but rather receives his maintenance from the father, who trains the son to be responsible. If one cheats oneself by defying the order of a bona fide spiritual master or Kṛṣṇa, one certainly becomes a nondevotee, or sense enjoyer, and falls from the spiritual path. Therefore, one should be trained to serve a bona fide spiritual master and thus become mature in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**While engaged in serving the spiritual master one should remain as a humble servant, and thus when the guru is walking the servant should humbly walk behind. When the guru lies down to sleep, the servant should also lie down nearby, and when the guru has awakened, the servant should sit near him, massaging his lotus feet and rendering other, similar services. When the guru is sitting down on his āsana, the servant should stand nearby with folded hands, awaiting the guru’s order. In this way one should always worship the spiritual master.**

The word *evaṁ-vṛttaḥ* indicates that although one may eventually marry and become prominent in society as an intellectual, politician or businessman, during student life one must remain without false prestige as a humble servant of the bona fide spiritual master. The *naiṣṭhiki-brahmacārī,* who never marries, is described in the following verse.

*yady asau chandasāṁ lokam

### Synonyms

*yadi* — if; *asau* — that student; *chandasām* *lokam* — the Maharloka planet; *ārokṣyan* — desiring to ascend to; *brahma*-*viṣṭapam* — Brahmaloka; *gurave* — unto the *guru*; *vinyaset* — he should offer; *deham* — his body; *sva*-*adhyāya* — of superior Vedic studies; *artham* — for the purpose; *bṛhat*-*vrataḥ* — observing the powerful vow of perpetual celibacy.

### Translation

**If the brahmacārī student desires to ascend to the Maharloka or Brahmaloka planets, then he should completely surrender his activities to the spiritual master and, observing the powerful vow of perpetual celibacy, dedicate himself to superior Vedic studies.**

### Purport

One who desires the supreme perfection of life must engage his body, mind and words in the service of a bona fide spiritual master. One desiring elevation to superior planets such as Brahmaloka and Maharloka must fully engage in the spiritual master’s service. We can thus imagine the sincerity of purpose and service required to achieve the Kṛṣṇaloka planet, which lies far beyond the material universe.

### Synonyms

*agnau* — in fire; *gurau* — in the spiritual master; *ātmani* — in oneself; *ca* — also; *sarva*-*bhūteṣu* — in all living entities; *mām* — Me; *param* — the Supreme; *apṛthak*-*dhīḥ* — without any concept of duality; *upāsīta* — one should worship; *brahma*-*varcasvī* — possessing Vedic enlightenment; *akalmaṣaḥ* — sinless.

### Translation

**Thus enlightened in Vedic knowledge by service to the spiritual master, freed from all sins and duality, one should worship Me as the Supersoul, as I appear within fire, the spiritual master, one’s own self and all living entities.**

### Purport

One becomes glorious and enlightened by faithfully serving a bona fide spiritual master, who is expert in the Vedic way of life. Thus purified, one never engages in sinful activities, which immediately extinguish the fire of spiritual enlightenment; nor does one become foolish and small-minded, trying to exploit material nature for personal sense gratification. A purified human being is *apṛthag-dhī,* or without consciousness of duality, because he has been trained to observe the Supreme Personality of Godhead within all things. Such sublime consciousness should be systematically taught throughout the world so that human society will become peaceful and sublime.

### Synonyms

*strīṇām* — in relation to women; *nirīkṣaṇa* — glancing; *sparśa* — touching; *saṁlāpa* — conversing; *kṣvelana* — joking or sporting; *ādikam* — and so on; *prāṇinaḥ* — living entities; *mithunī*-*bhūtān* — engaged in sex; *agṛha*-*sthaḥ* — a *sannyāsī,* *vānaprastha* or *brahmacārī*; *agrataḥ* — first of all; *tyajet* — should give up.

### Translation

**Those who are not married — sannyāsīs, vānaprasthas and brahmacārīs — should never associate with women by glancing, touching, conversing, joking or sporting. Neither should they ever associate with any living entity engaged in sexual activities.**

### Purport

*Prāṇinaḥ* indicates all living entities, whether birds, bees or human beings. Among most species of life, sexual intercourse is preceded by diverse mating rituals. In human society, all types of entertainment (books, music, films) and all places of amusement (restaurants, shopping centers, resorts) are designed to stimulate the sexual urge and create an aura of “romance.” One who is not married — a *sannyāsī,* *brahmacārī* or *vānaprastha* — should rigidly avoid anything related to sex and of course should never see any living entity, whether bird, insect or human, engaging in the various phases of sexual intercourse. When a man jokes with a woman, an intimate, sexually charged atmosphere is immediately created, and this should also be avoided for those aspiring to practice celibacy. Even a householder who becomes attached to such activities will also fall down into the darkness of ignorance.

### Translation

**A brāhmaṇa observing the great vow of celibacy becomes brilliant like fire and by serious austerity burns to ashes the propensity to perform material activities. Free from the contamination of material desire, he becomes My devotee.**

### Purport

The process of liberation is described in this verse. Once when Śrīla Prabhupāda was traveling by airplane, a fellow passenger, who happened to be a priest, told him that he had seen his disciples and found them “bright-faced.” Śrīla Prabhupāda was fond of relating this incident. The spirit soul is more brilliant than the sun, and as the process of spiritual purification gradually takes effect, even the external form of a devotee becomes effulgent. The glowing fire of spiritual knowledge burns to ashes the mentality of sense gratification, and one naturally becomes austere and disinterested in mundane enjoyment. Among all austerities, the best is celibacy, by which the shackles of material life immediately become slackened. One who is *amala,* free from material desire, is known as a pure devotee of the Lord. On the paths of *jñāna,* *karma* and *yoga* the mind retains the concept of personal interest, but on the path of pure devotion the mind is trained to see only the interests of the Personality of Godhead. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord is *amala,* completely pure.

### Translation

**A brahmacārī who has completed his Vedic education and desires to enter household life should offer proper remuneration to the spiritual master, bathe, cut his hair, put on proper clothes, and so on. Then, taking permission from the guru, he should go back to his home.**

### Purport

This verse describes the process called *samāvartana,* or returning to one’s home after finishing Vedic education in the *āśrama* of the spiritual master. One who cannot concentrate all of his desires in the devotional service of the Lord is attracted to householder life, and if this attraction is not regulated, one will fall down. Being covered by the ignorance of fruitive activities and mental speculation, a living entity seeks enjoyment outside the devotional service of the Supreme Lord and becomes a nondevotee. One who takes to family life must rigidly follow the Vedic rules and regulations in order to avoid the collapse of his spiritual determination. One who enjoys intimate sense gratification with women must become duplicitous in his dealings with others and consequently falls down from the platform of simple, pure life. When the mind is disturbed by lust, one begins to resent the principle of submission to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotee, and the dark clouds of one’s offensive mentality completely cover the light of spiritual knowledge. One should dovetail his propensity to love someone by serving the lotus feet of a pure devotee. As stated in Vedic literature, “One who worships Govinda, Lord Kṛṣṇa, but does not worship His devotees is not to be considered an advanced Vaiṣṇava; rather, he is to be considered a proud hypocrite.”

*gṛham* — the family home; *vanam* — the forest; *vā* — either; *upaviśet* — one should enter; *pravrajet* — one should renounce; *vā* — or; *dvija*-*uttamaḥ* — a *brāhmaṇa*; *āśramāt* — from one authorized status of life; *āśramam* — to another authorized status; *gacchet* — one should go; *na* — not; *anyathā* — otherwise; *amat*-*paraḥ* — one who is not surrendered to Me; *caret* — should act.

### Translation

**A brahmacārī desiring to fulfill his material desires should live at home with his family, and a householder who is eager to purify his consciousness should enter the forest, whereas a purified brāhmaṇa should accept the renounced order of life. One who is not surrendered to Me should move progressively from one āśrama to another, never acting otherwise.**

### Purport

Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe the regulations governing one’s authorized social status. There are four social divisions of life, namely *brahmacarya, gṛhastha,* *vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa.* One who wants to fulfill material desires should become an ordinary householder (*gṛhastha*), establish a comfortable residence and maintain his family. One desiring to accelerate the process of purification may give up his home and business and live in a sacred place with his wife, as indicated here by the word *vanam,* or “forest.” There are many sacred forests in India meant for this purpose, such as Vṛndāvana and Māyāpur. The word *dvijottama* indicates the *brāhmaṇas.* *Brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* are all *dvija,* or initiated in the Gāyatrī *mantra,* but the *brāhmaṇa* is *dvijottama,* or the highest among those who have received second birth by spiritual initiation. It is recommended that a purified *brāhmaṇa* take to the renounced order of life (*sannyāsa*), giving up further contact with his so-called wife. The *brāhmaṇa* is specifically mentioned here, since *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* are not to take the renounced order of life. Even so, there are many stories in the *Bhāgavatam* wherein great kings retire with their aristocratic wives to the forest to practice the austerities of *vānaprastha* and thus accelerate the process of purification. The *brāhmaṇas,* however, may directly accept the renounced order of life.

The words *āśramād āśramaṁ gacchet* indicate that one may progressively move from *brahmacārī* life to *gṛhastha* life to *vānaprastha* life and then to *sannyāsa.* The words *āśramād āśramam* emphasize that one should never remain without an authorized social status, nor should one go backward, falling down from a higher position. Those who are not surrendered devotees of the Lord must rigidly observe such injunctions, for otherwise they will quickly become degraded, and their sins will place them outside the bounds of authorized human civilization.

Lord Kṛṣṇa emphasizes here that a nondevotee must rigidly observe the rituals and regulations of Vedic social divisions, whereas the Lord’s pure devotee, engaged twenty-four hours a day in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s mission, is transcendental to such divisions. If, however, one performs illicit activities on the strength of being transcendental to Vedic social divisions, one is revealed to be a materialistic neophyte and not an advanced devotee of the Lord. An advanced devotee, who remains aloof from material sense gratification, is not bound by the Vedic social divisions; thus even a householder may live very austerely, traveling and preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness away from home, and even a *sannyāsī* may sometimes engage women in the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The most advanced devotees cannot be restricted by the rituals and regulations of the *varṇāśrama* system, and they move freely around the world distributing love of Godhead. *Mat-para* indicates a pure devotee of the Lord who always keeps the Lord fixed in his heart and consciousness. One who falls down to become a victim of sense gratification is not fully established on the platform of *mat-para* and should rigidly observe the social divisions and regulations to remain steady on the platform of pious human life.

*gṛhārthī sadṛśīṁ bhāryām

### Synonyms

*gṛha* — household; *arthī* — one who desires; *sadṛśīm* — possessing similar characteristics; *bhāryām* — a wife; *udvahet* — one should marry; *ajugupsitām* — beyond reproach; *yavīyasīm* — younger; *tu* — indeed; *vayasā* — by age; *yām* — another wife; *sa*-*varṇām* — the first wife who is of the same caste; *anu* — after; *kramāt* — in succession.

### Translation

**One who desires to establish family life should marry a wife of his own caste, who is beyond reproach and younger in age. If one desires to accept many wives he must marry them after the first marriage, and each wife should be of a successively lower caste.**

### Purport

As stated in the Vedic literature,

*tisro varṇānupūrvyeṇa  
dve tathaikā yathā-kramam  
brāhmaṇa-kṣatriya-viśāṁ  
bhāryāḥ svāḥ śūdra-janmanaḥ*

The purport of this verse is that one’s first wife must always be *sadṛśīm,* or similar to oneself. In other words, an intellectual man should marry an intellectual wife, a heroic man should marry a heroic wife, a business minded man should marry a woman who can encourage him in such activities, and a *śūdra* should marry a less intelligent woman. The wife must be beyond reproach in terms of her background and character and should always be younger than oneself, ideally five to ten years younger. If one desires to marry a second wife, then, as stated in this verse by the word *varṇānupūrvyeṇa* and in the verse spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa by the word *anukramāt,* one must wait until the first marriage is established and then select a second wife from the next-lower caste. If one marries a third time the wife must be, again, from the next-lower caste. For example, a *brāhmaṇa’s* first wife will be a *brāhmaṇī,* his second wife will be from the *kṣatriya* community, his third wife from the *vaiśya* community and fourth wife from the *śūdra* community. A *kṣatriya* may first marry a *kṣatriya* lady and then *vaiśya* and *śūdra* ladies. A *vaiśya* can accept wives from two classes, and a *śūdra* will accept a wife only from the *śūdra* class. By this progression of marriages there will be relative peace in the family. These Vedic marriage injunctions, as mentioned in the previous verse, are especially for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord.

### Translation

**All twice-born men — brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — must perform sacrifice, study the Vedic literature and give charity. Only the brāhmaṇas, however, accept charity, teach the Vedic knowledge and perform sacrifice on behalf of others.**

### Purport

All civilized men must participate in sacrificial performances, give charity and study the Vedic literature. The best of the twice-born, namely the *brāhmaṇas,* are specifically empowered to lead sacrificial performances on behalf of all members of society, teach everyone Vedic knowledge and receive everyone’s charity. Without the assistance or participation of qualified *brāhmaṇas,* the lower classes cannot properly study the Vedic literature, perform sacrifices or give in charity, because they do not have the required intelligence to perfectly execute such functions. When *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* take shelter of bona fide *brāhmaṇas,* they are able to properly execute their respective duties, and society functions smoothly and efficiently.

### Translation

**A brāhmaṇa who considers that accepting charity from others will destroy his austerity, spiritual influence and fame should maintain himself by the other two brahminical occupations, namely teaching Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. If the brāhmaṇa considers that those two occupations also compromise his spiritual position, then he should collect rejected grains in agricultural fields and live without any dependence on others.**

### Purport

A pure devotee of the Lord should always remember that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will personally take care of him. As the Lord states in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.22):

*ananyāś cintayanto māṁ  
ye janāḥ paryupāsate  
teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ  
yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham*

“But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form — to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have.”

A *brāhmaṇa* should not become a professional beggar for his personal maintenance. In India there are many so-called *brāhmaṇas* who sit at the gates of important temples and beg from everyone who comes and goes. If someone does not give a donation they become angry and chase that person. Similarly, in America there are many big preachers who collect huge amounts of money by begging on television and radio. If a *brāhmaṇa* or Vaiṣṇava considers that being a professional beggar is weakening his austerity, destroying his spiritual influence and giving him a bad reputation, then he should give up that process. One may beg everyone to contribute to the cause of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one will be diminished in austerity, influence and reputation by begging for one’s personal livelihood. A *brāhmaṇa* may then take up the task of teaching Vedic knowledge and performing sacrifice. But even such occupations do not bring one to the highest platform of trust in God. A *brāhmaṇa* who teaches as a means of livelihood may often be curbed in his teaching, and one who performs sacrifice may be manipulated by materialistic worshipers. In this way, a *brāhmaṇa* may be placed in an embarrassing and compromised position. Therefore a high-class *brāhmaṇa* or Vaiṣṇava ultimately will depend completely on the mercy of the Lord for his maintenance. The Lord promises to maintain His devotee, and an advanced Vaiṣṇava never doubts the word of the Lord.

### Translation

**The body of a brāhmaṇa is not intended to enjoy insignificant material sense gratification; rather, by accepting difficult austerities in his life, a brāhmaṇa will enjoy unlimited happiness after death.**

### Purport

One may ask why a *brāhmaṇa* should voluntarily accept inconvenience in keeping his body and soul together. In this verse the Lord explains that advanced human life is meant for serious austerity and not for insignificant sense gratification. By spiritual advancement one is fixed in transcendental bliss on the spiritual platform and gives up useless absorption in the temporary material body. One should remain detached from the material body, accepting only the bare necessities of life. The *brāhmaṇas,* by accepting a troublesome form of livelihood, never forget that the material body is destined to grow old, become diseased and die in misery. Thus remaining alert and transcendental, an advanced *brāhmaṇa,* at the end of this life, goes back home, back to Godhead, where he enjoys unlimited spiritual bliss. Without such higher awareness, how can one be considered a qualified *brāhmaṇa?*

Those devotees engaged twenty-four hours a day in spreading the mission of Lord Kṛṣṇa are beyond the platform of renunciation or sense gratification because they engage everything in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service. A pure devotee of the Lord eats only to get strength for serving the Lord and does not accept either sumptuous or meager food simply for the body’s sake. However, everything may be accepted for the Lord, even sumptuous meals. A *brāhmaṇa* who is not working day and night to spread the glories of the Lord should feel embarrassed to eat sumptuously for his personal sense gratification, but a renounced Vaiṣṇava preacher may accept invitations from all classes of pious people, and just to bless their homes he will eat the opulent foods they offer to him. Similarly, he sometimes eats sumptuously to get strength for defeating atheists and impersonalists. As stated in Vedic literature, one cannot be a highly qualified *brāhmaṇa* unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord. And among the devotees, those who are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness are the best, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in the Eighteenth Chapter of *Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Translation

**A brāhmaṇa householder should remain satisfied in mind by gleaning rejected grains from agricultural fields and marketplaces. Keeping himself free of personal desire, he should practice magnanimous religious principles, with consciousness absorbed in Me. In this way a brāhmaṇa may stay at home as a householder without very much attachment and thus achieve liberation.**

### Purport

*Mahāntam* refers to magnanimous religious principles such as very hospitably receiving guests, even those who are uninvited and unexpected. Householders must always be magnanimous and charitable to others, being alert to curb unnecessary affection and attachment in family life. In the past, very renounced *brāhmaṇa* householders would collect grains that had fallen on the ground in the marketplace or those that had been left behind in the fields after harvesting. The most important item here is *mayy arpitātmā,* or fixing the mind in Lord Kṛṣṇa. Despite his material situation, anyone who constantly meditates upon the Lord can become a liberated soul. As stated in *Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu* (1.2.187):

*īhā yasya harer dāsye  
karmaṇā manasā girā  
nikhilāsv api avasthāsu  
jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate*

“A person acting in Kṛṣṇa consciousness \[or, in other words, in the service of Kṛṣṇa\] with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.”

*samuddharanti* — uplift; *ye* — those who; *vipram* — a *brāhmaṇa* or devotee; *sīdantam* — suffering (from poverty); *mat*-*parāyaṇam* — surrendered to Me; *tān* — those who have uplifted; *uddhariṣye* — I will uplift; *na* *cirāt* — in the near future; *āpadbhyaḥ* — from all miseries; *nauḥ* — a boat; *iva* — like; *arṇavāt* — from the ocean.

### Translation

**Just as a ship rescues those who have fallen into the ocean, similarly, I very quickly rescue from all calamities those persons who uplift brāhmaṇas and devotees suffering in a poverty-stricken condition.**

### Purport

The Lord has described how *brāhmaṇas* and devotees achieve the perfection of life, and now a similar perfection is offered to those who utilize their materialistic wealth to relieve the poverty-stricken condition of devotees and *brāhmaṇas.* Although one may neglect the devotional service of the Lord to pursue a material life of sense gratification, one can rectify one’s position by dedicating one’s hard-earned money to the service of the Lord. Seeing the difficult austerities accepted by saintly persons, a pious person should make arrangements for their comfort. Just as a boat saves hopeless people who have fallen into the ocean, similarly, the Lord uplifts persons who have hopelessly fallen into the ocean of material attachment if they have been charitable to the *brāhmaṇas* and devotees.

### Translation

**Just as the chief bull elephant protects all other elephants in his herd and defends himself as well, similarly, a fearless king, just like a father, must save all of the citizens from difficulty and also protect himself.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa, having concluded His discussion of brahminical duties, now describes the character and activities of a king. Protecting all of the citizens from difficulty is an essential duty for the king.

*sīdan vipro vaṇig-vṛttyā  
paṇyair evāpadaṁ taret  
khaḍgena vāpadākrānto  
na śva-vṛttyā kathañcana*

### Synonyms

*sīdan* — suffering; *vipraḥ* — a *brāhmaṇa*; *vaṇik* — of a merchant; *vṛttyā* — by the occupation; *paṇyaiḥ* — by doing business; *eva* — indeed; *āpadam* — suffering; *taret* — should overcome; *khaḍgena* — with sword; *vā* — or; *āpadā* — by suffering; *ākrāntaḥ* — afflicted; *na* — not; *śva* — of the dog; *vṛttyā* — by the occupation; *kathañcana* — by any means.

### Translation

**If a brāhmaṇa cannot support himself through his regular duties and is thus suffering, he may adopt the occupation of a merchant and overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling material things. If he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt the occupation of a kṣatriya, taking sword in hand. But he cannot in any circumstances become like a dog, accepting an ordinary master.**

### Purport

*Śva-vṛttyā,* or “a dog’s profession,” refers to the *śūdras,* who cannot live without accepting a master. A destitute *brāhmaṇa* who is suffering intolerably may become a merchant and then a *kṣatriya* but may never take the position of a *śūdra* by working in a company or accepting a master. Although a *kṣatriya* is ordinarily considered more elevated than a *vaiśya,* the Lord here recommends that distressed *brāhmaṇas* first accept the *vaiśya* occupation, since it is not violent.

### Translation

**A king or other member of the royal order who cannot maintain himself by his normal occupation may act as a vaiśya, may live by hunting or may act as a brāhmaṇa by teaching others Vedic knowledge. But he may not under any circumstances adopt the profession of a śūdra.**

However, all members of society who have adopted inferior occupations in emergency situations must give up those substitute occupations when the difficulties have passed.**

### Synonyms

*veda*-*adhyāya* — by study of Vedic knowledge; *svadhā* — by offering the *mantra* *svadhā*; *svāhā* — by offering the *mantra* *svāhā*; *bali* — by token offerings of food; *anna*-*ādyaiḥ* — by offering grains, water, etc.; *yathā* — according to; *udayam* — one’s prosperity; *deva* — the demigods; *ṛṣi* — sages; *pitṛ* — the forefathers; *bhūtāni* — and all living entities; *mat*-*rūpāṇi* — manifestations of My potency; *anu*-*aham* — daily; *yajet* — one should worship.

### Translation

**One in the gṛhastha order of life should daily worship the sages by Vedic study, the forefathers by offering the mantra svadhā, the demigods by chanting svāhā, all living entities by offering shares of one’s meals, and human beings by offering grains and water. Thus considering the demigods, sages, forefathers, living entities and human beings to be manifestations of My potency, one should daily perform these five sacrifices.**

### Purport

The Lord again discusses the duties of those in the household order of life. Obviously, the five ritualistic daily sacrifices mentioned here are meant for those who are not pure devotees of the Lord and who thus have to counteract their exploitation of material nature by the abovementioned sacrifices. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) is training householders, *sannyāsīs,* *brahmacārīs* and *vānaprasthas* to engage twenty-four hours a day in the loving service of the Lord. Those who are full-time missionary workers in ISKCON have no further obligations or sacrifices to perform, as confirmed in the Eleventh Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (11.5.41):

*devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṝṇāṁ  
na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛṇī ca rājan  
sarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁ  
gato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kartam*

“Anyone who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers.”

### Translation

**A householder should comfortably maintain his dependents either with money that comes of its own accord or with that gathered by honest execution of one’s duties. According to one’s means, one should perform sacrifices and other religious ceremonies.**

### Purport

The Lord here describes the religious duties that are to be performed as far as possible, according to one’s means, and when there is opportunity.

*kuṭumbeṣu na sajjeta  
na pramādyet kuṭumby api

### Synonyms

*kuṭumbeṣu* — to the family members; *na* — not; *sajjeta* — one should be attached; *na* — not; *pramādyet* — should become crazy; *kuṭumbī* — having many dependent family members; *api* — although; *vipaścit* — a wise person; *naśvaram* — temporary; *paśyet* — should see; *adṛṣṭam* — future rewards such as residence in heaven; *api* — indeed; *dṛṣṭa*-*vat* — just like that which is already experienced.

### Translation

**A householder taking care of many dependent family members should not become materially attached to them, nor should he become mentally unbalanced, considering himself to be the lord. An intelligent householder should see that all possible future happiness, just like that which he has already experienced, is temporary.**

### Purport

A family man often acts like a lord, protecting his wife, ordering his children, maintaining servants, grandchildren, domestic animals, and so forth. The words *na pramādyet kuṭumby api* indicate that although one acts like a little lord, surrounded by his family, servants and friends, one should not, through false pride, become mentally unbalanced, considering oneself to be the actual lord. The word *vipaścit* indicates that one should remain sober and intelligent, never forgetting oneself to be the eternal servant of the Supreme Lord.

Householders of the upper, middle and lower classes become attached to different types of sense gratification. In any economic or social class, however, one should remember that all material enjoyment, either here or in the next life, is temporary and ultimately useless. A responsible householder should guide his family members and other dependents back home, back to Godhead, for an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. One should not become a false and puffed-up lord for a brief span of time, for then one will remain bound up, along with his family members, in the cycle of repeated birth and death.

*putra-dārāpta-bandhūnāṁ  
saṅgamaḥ pāntha-saṅgamaḥ  
anu-dehaṁ viyanty ete  
svapno nidrānugo yathā*

### Synonyms

*putra* — of children; *dāra* — wife; *āpta* — relatives; *bandhūnām* — and friends; *saṅgamaḥ* — the association, living together; *pāntha* — of travelers; *saṅgamaḥ* — association; *anu*-*deham* — with each change of body; *viyanti* — they are separated; *ete* — all these; *svapnaḥ* — a dream; *nidrā* — in sleep; *anugaḥ* — occurring; *yathā* — just as.

### Translation

**The association of children, wife, relatives and friends is just like the brief meeting of travelers. With each change of body one is separated from all such associates, just as one loses the objects one possesses in a dream when the dream is over.**

### Purport

*Pāntha-saṅgama* indicates the momentary association of travelers at hotels, restaurants, tourist spots or, in more traditional cultures, freshwater wells and walking paths. We are now associated with many relatives, friends and well-wishers, but as soon as we change our material body we will immediately be separated from all these associates, just as upon awakening we are immediately separated from the imaginary situation of a dream. One becomes attached to the sense gratification of one’s dream, and similarly, under the spell of the illusory concepts of “I” and “mine,” we become attached to so-called relatives and friends who gratify our sense of false ego. Unfortunately, such fleeting egoistic association covers our real knowledge of the self and the Supreme, and we remain hovering in material illusion, futilely endeavoring for permanent sense gratification. One who remains attached to the bodily concept of family and friends cannot possibly give up the false egoism of “I” and “mine,” or “I am everything and everything is mine.”

Without giving up material sense gratification we cannot become steady on the transcendental platform of devotional service, and therefore we cannot relish the actual flavor of eternal happiness. Unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord, accepting Lord Kṛṣṇa as one’s only friend, one cannot give up the hankering for temporary and superficial material relationships. A traveler far away from his home and loved ones may strike up superficial conversations with other travelers, but such relationships have no ultimate meaning. One should therefore revive one’s lost relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa. We are constitutionally part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the reservoir of all spiritual pleasure, and our original relationship with Him is full of love and happiness. But because of our desire to enjoy independently from Him, we fall down into the confusing, meaningless network of material relationships created by *māyā.* An intelligent person realizes there is no actual pleasure or satisfaction for the soul on either this planet or any other material planet. Therefore, like a weary traveler exhausted from his journey, he should go back home, back to Godhead, for eternal peace as the faithful servant of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*ittham* — thus; *parimṛśan* — deeply considering; *muktaḥ* — a liberated soul; *gṛheṣu* — at home; *atithi*-*vat* — just like a guest; *vasan* — living; *na* — not; *gṛhaiḥ* — by the domestic situation; *anubadhyeta* — should become bound; *nirmamaḥ* — without any sense of personal proprietorship; *nirahaṅkṛtaḥ* — without false ego.

### Translation

**Deeply considering the actual situation, a liberated soul should live at home just like a guest, without any sense of proprietorship or false ego. In this way he will not be bound or entangled by domestic affairs.**

### Purport

The word *mukta,* or “liberated,” refers to one freed from all material attachment. In this status, called *mukta-saṅga,* one no longer identifies oneself as a permanent resident of the material world. This liberated status may be attained even by one situated in family life. The only requirement is that one should take up a serious program of *kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana,* which includes constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord, worship of the Deity and participation in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Without a serious program of *kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana* it is very difficult to give up the iron shackles of attachment to women and the byproducts of such attachment.

### Translation

**A householder devotee who worships Me by execution of his family duties may remain at home, go to a holy place or, if he has a responsible son, take sannyāsa.**

### Purport

This verse describes the three alternatives for a householder. He may continue at home, or he may take *vānaprastha,* which involves going to a sacred place with one’s wife. Or if he has a responsible son to take over his family duties, he may take *sannyāsa,* the renounced order, for a definitive solution to the problems of life. In all three *āśramas,* ultimate success depends on sincere surrender to the Supreme Lord; therefore, the most important qualification one can have is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**But a householder whose mind is attached to his home and who is thus disturbed by ardent desires to enjoy his money and children, who is lusty after women, who is possessed of a miserly mentality and who unintelligently thinks, “Everything is mine and I am everything,” is certainly bound in illusion.**

### Purport

Although one may try by various analytical or psychological processes to detach the mind from illusory family attachment, one will inevitably be drawn back into the network of material attachment unless the heart is purified by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A miserly householder thinks only of his own family or community, without mercy for outsiders. Being egoistic, lusty, attached and always disturbed by ardent desires to enjoy money and children, a materialistic householder is hopelessly bound in a web of anxiety.

### Translation

**Thus, because of his foolish mentality, a householder whose heart is overwhelmed by family attachment is never satisfied. Constantly meditating on his relatives, he dies and enters into the darkness of ignorance.**

### Purport

*Andhaṁ viśate tamaḥ* indicates that in his next life an attached householder will certainly be degraded because of his primitive mentality of bodily attachment, which is called *mūḍha-dhī.* In other words, after enjoying the sense gratification of considering oneself the center of everything, one enters into a lower species of life. Somehow or other, we must fix our minds on Lord Kṛṣṇa and come out of the darkness of ignorance to our real life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
