CHAPTER FOUR

The various forms of the past, present and future incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Hari, and the various transcendental characteristics of each of these *avatāras* constitute the subject matter of this chapter.

Even if it were ever possible to count all the particles of dust on the face of the earth, any attempt to count all the innumerable transcendental qualities of the unlimited Lord Hari, the foundation of all potencies, would be simply madness. The Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa created the universe out of the five elements manufactured by His own *māyā,* entered into that universe in the form of the Supersoul and became known as the Puruṣa-avatāra. He effects the work of creation in the mode of passion through the personal form of Brahmā, of protection in the mode of goodness through the form of the Lord of sacrifice, Viṣṇu, and of annihilation in the mode of ignorance through the form of Rudra. Incarnating in the form of Nara-Nārāyaṇa, the greatest of sages, from the womb of Mūrti, the daughter of Dakṣa and wife of Dharma, He preached by His own practical demonstration the science of *naiṣkarmyam.* When Cupid (Kandarpa) and his hosts were sent to Badarikāśrama by King Indra, who had become fearful and envious at seeing the austerities of Lord Nara-Nārāyaṇa, that best of sages welcomed Cupid as an honored guest. The pacified Cupid then offered prayers to the Supreme Personality Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi. By the order of the sage, Cupid returned from there with Urvaśī and upon presenting himself before Indra related to him everything that had taken place.

The Personality of Godhead Lord Viṣṇu has appeared in various partial incarnations for the benefit of the entire world and has given instructions in spiritual knowledge in the forms of Haṁsa, Dattātreya, Sanaka and the other Kumāra brothers, and Ṛṣabhadeva. In the form of Hayagrīva He killed the demon Madhu and saved all the *Vedas.* In the *avatāra* of Matsya, the fish, He protected both the earth and Satyavrata Manu. In the incarnation of Varāha, the boar, He delivered the earth and destroyed Hiraṇyākṣa; in that of Kūrma, the tortoise, He carried Mandara Mountain upon His back; and in the form of Śrī Hari He gave liberation to the king of the elephants. The Lord delivered the Vālakhilyas, who had been trapped in the water in a cow’s hoofprint, He delivered Indra from the reaction for murdering a *brāhmaṇa,* and He delivered the wives of the demigods from imprisonment in the palaces of the demoniac *asuras.* In the *avatāra* of Nṛsiṁha, He killed Hiraṇyakaśipu. In the reign of each Manu He kills the demons, fulfills the needs of the demigods and protects all the planetary systems. In the form of Vāmana, the dwarf *brāhmaṇa* boy, He cheated Bali Mahārāja; in the form of Paraśurāma He rid the earth of *kṣatriyas* twenty-one times; and in the form of Śrī Rāma He brought the ocean under His submission and killed Rāvaṇa. Descending into the Yadu dynasty, He removed the burden of the earth. In the form of Buddha, by His argumentative preaching in defiance of the *Vedas* He bewildered the demons who were unqualified to perform sacrifices, and at the end of Kali-yuga He will destroy the *śūdra* kings in His form of Kalki. In this way the innumerable appearances and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Hari are described.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*rājā* *uvāca* — the King said; *yāni* *yāni* — each; *iha* — in this world; *karmāṇi* — of the activities; *yaiḥ* *yaiḥ* — by each; *svacchanda* — assumed independently; *janmabhiḥ* — of the appearances; *cakre* — He performed; *karoti* — is performing; *kartā* — will perform; *vā* — or; *hariḥ* — the Supreme Lord, Hari; *tāni* — these; *bruvantu* — please tell; *naḥ* — us.

### Translation

**King Nimi said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead descends into the material world by His internal potency and according to His own desire. Therefore, please tell us about the various pastimes Lord Hari has performed in the past, is performing now and will perform in this world in the future in His various incarnations.**

### Purport

In this Fourth Chapter the son of Jayantī, Drumila, will address King Nimi. The forty-eighth verse of the Third Chapter stated, *mūrtyābhimatayātmanaḥ:* “One should worship the particular form of the Lord most attractive to oneself.” Similarly it was stated in the previous chapter, *stavaiḥ stutvā named dharim:* “One should bow down to Lord Hari after glorifying Him with prayers.” Thus it is assumed that the worshiper has knowledge of the Supreme Lord’s transcendental qualities and pastimes in order to execute the process of worship previously described. King Nimi, therefore, is eagerly inquiring about the various incarnations of the Supreme Lord so that he can ascertain which particular form of the Supreme Lord is most suitable for his personal worship. It is understood that King Nimi is a Vaiṣṇava, or devotee, who is trying to advance in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

It is important to note in this regard that the word *abhimata-mūrti,* meaning “one’s most desirable form,” does not indicate that one may concoct a form of the Lord by one’s own whim. *Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.* All the forms of the Supreme Lord are *anādim,* or eternal. Thus there is no question of concocting a form, because such a concoction would be *ādi,* or the origin of the concocted form. *Abhimata-mūrti* means that among the eternal forms of the Lord one should select that form which most inspires one’s love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such love cannot be imitated, but it is automatically aroused when one follows the prescribed rules and regulations given by the bona fide spiritual master and submissively hears these descriptions of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*drumilaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Drumila said; *yaḥ* — who; *vai* — indeed; *anantasya* — of the unlimited Lord; *guṇān* — the transcendental qualities; *anantān* — which are unlimited; *anukramiṣyan* — trying to enumerate; *saḥ* — he; *tu* — certainly; *bāla*-*buddhiḥ* — is a person of childish intelligence; *rajāṁsi* — the particles of dust; *bhūmeḥ* — on the earth; *gaṇayet* — one may count; *kathañcit* — somehow; *kālena* — in time; *na* *eva* — but not; *akhila*-*śakti*-*dhāmnaḥ* — (the qualities) of the reservoir of all potencies.

### Translation

**Śrī Drumila said: Anyone trying to enumerate or describe fully the unlimited qualities of the unlimited Supreme Lord has the intelligence of a foolish child. Even if a great genius could somehow or other, after a time-consuming endeavor, count all the particles of dust on the surface of the earth, such a genius could never count the attractive qualities of the Personality of Godhead, who is the reservoir of all potencies.**

### Purport

In reply to King Nimi’s request that the *nava-yogendras* describe all the qualities and pastimes of the Lord, Śrī Drumila here explains that only the most foolish person would even attempt such a comprehensive description of the unlimited qualities and pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. Such foolish, childish persons, however, are far more advanced than ignorant materialistic scientists who actually try to describe all knowledge without even referring to the Personality of Godhead. In other words, although it is impossible to describe the Lord fully, foolish atheistic scientists attempt to describe all knowledge without even having reached the most preliminary knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. Such atheistic persons should be understood to be shortsighted and of very weak intelligence, despite their showy material achievements, which ultimately end in great suffering and destruction. It is said that Lord Anantadeva Himself, with His innumerable tongues, cannot even begin to vibrate completely the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this verse is very nice. No human being can hope to count the number of particles on the surface of the earth; therefore no one should foolishly try to understand the Supreme Lord by his own tiny endeavor. One should submissively hear knowledge of God as it is spoken by God Himself in *Bhagavad-gītā,* and thus one should gradually be elevated to the stage of hearing *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* According to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by tasting a drop of seawater one can get a general idea of the flavor of the entire ocean. Similarly, by submissively hearing about the Personality of Godhead one can acquire a qualitative understanding of the Absolute Truth, although quantitatively one’s knowledge can never be complete.

puraṁ virājaṁ viracayya tasmin

### Synonyms

*bhūtaiḥ* — by the material elements; *yadā* — when; *pañcabhiḥ* — five (earth, water, fire, air and ether); *ātma*-*sṛṣṭaiḥ* — created by Himself; *puram* — the body; *virājam* — of the universe in its subtle form; *viracayya* — having constructed; *tasmin* — within that; *sva*-*aṁśena* — in the manifestation of His own plenary expansion; *viṣṭaḥ* — entering; *puruṣa*-*abhidhānam* — the name Puruṣa; *avāpa* — assumed; *nārāyaṇaḥ* — Lord Nārāyaṇa; *ādi*-*devaḥ* — the original Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**When the primeval Lord Nārāyaṇa created His universal body out of the five elements produced from Himself and then entered within that universal body by His own plenary portion, He thus became known as the Puruṣa.**

### Purport

The words *bhūtaiḥ pañcabhiḥ* in this verse refer to the five gross material elements — earth, water, fire, air and sky — which form the basic building blocks of the material world. When the conditioned living entity enters within these five elements, consciousness becomes manifest, along with the functions of the mind and intelligence. Unfortunately, the consciousness manifest under the modes of material nature is governed by *ahaṅkāra,* or false ego, in which the living entity wrongly considers himself the enjoyer of the material elements. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Puruṣottama, enjoys His pure transcendental existence in the spiritual sky, the material elements are also meant for His enjoyment, through the process of *yajña,* or sacrifice. This material world is called Devī-dhāma, or the abode of the illusory energy of the Lord, Māyādevī. The *Brahma-saṁhitā* explains that the Supreme Person is not at all attracted to His inferior energy, *māyā,* but when the material creation is used in the devotional service of the Lord, the Lord becomes attracted by the devotion and sacrifice of the living entities, and thus, indirectly, He is also the enjoyer of the material world.

We should not think that the pastimes of Lord Nārāyaṇa as the Supersoul and creator of this universe are on a lower spiritual level than Nārāyaṇa’s eternal pastimes in the spiritual world. Were Lord Nārāyaṇa in any way to diminish His transcendental bliss and knowledge in His activities of material creation, He would have to be considered a conditioned soul, affected by contact with the illusory potency. But since Lord Nārāyaṇa is eternally aloof from the influence of *māyā,* His activities as the Supersoul of this universe are exactly on the same transcendental level as His activities in the spiritual world. All the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are part and parcel of His unlimited spiritual pastimes.

sattvādibhiḥ sthiti-layodbhava ādi-kartā*

### Synonyms

*yat*-*kāye* — within whose body; *eṣaḥ* — this; *bhuvana*-*traya* — of the three planetary systems making up the universe; *sanniveśaḥ* — the elaborate arrangement; *yasya* — of whom; *indriyaiḥ* — by the senses; *tanu*-*bhṛtām* — of the embodied living beings; *ubhaya*-*indriyāṇi* — both kinds of senses (knowledge-acquiring and active); *jñānam* — knowledge; *svataḥ* — directly from Him; *śvasanataḥ* — from His breathing; *balam* — strength of the body; *ojaḥ* — strength of the senses; *īhā* — activities; *sattva*-*ādibhiḥ* — by nature’s modes of goodness, passion and ignorance; *sthiti* — in maintenance; *laya* — destruction; *udbhave* — and creation; *ādi*-*kartā* — the original doer.

### Translation

**Within His body are elaborately arranged the three planetary systems of this universe. His transcendental senses generate the knowledge-acquiring and active senses of all embodied beings. His consciousness generates conditioned knowledge, and His powerful breathing produces the bodily strength, sensory power and conditioned activities of the embodied souls. He is the prime mover, through the agency of the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. And thus the universe is created, maintained and annihilated.**

### Purport

When a conditioned soul becomes completely exhausted by his strenuous activities, or when he is overcome by disease, death or fear, he loses all power to manifest practical knowledge or activities. Thus we should understand that independent of the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead we can neither work nor cultivate knowledge. By the mercy of the Personality of Godhead the conditioned soul acquires a material body, which is a perverted reflection of the unlimited spiritual body of the Lord. Thus the living entity engages in ignorant materialistic activities for society, friendship and love. But the entire program suddenly vanishes with the unforeseen dissolution of the material body. Similarly, our material knowledge is always subject to become null and void within an instant, since the material nature is itself constantly changing. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the prime mover behind the birth, maintenance and destruction of the universe. And the living entity should try to understand that Personality of Godhead who has given him so much facility for illusion. The Personality of Godhead actually wants the conditioned soul to surrender to Him and regain an eternal life of bliss and knowledge at the Lord’s side. The conditioned soul should reason, “If the Lord is giving me so much facility to merge into ignorance, surely He will give even more facility to come out of this ignorance if I humbly follow His direction without foolish speculations.”

This verse describes Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the second phase of the *puruṣa* incarnations of the Lord. This Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is glorified in the *Puruṣa-sūkta* prayers, expands Himself as the Supersoul to enter the heart of every living being. Through chanting the holy names of the Lord — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — even in this degraded age one can find the Supreme Lord within one’s heart. The Lord is a person as much as we are, but He is unlimited. Still, a personal loving relationship exists between the tiny living entity and the unlimited Supreme Lord. In consideration of this personal relationship, *bhakti-yoga* is the only suitable process by which to come to the ultimate understanding of our constitutional position as eternal servants of the Supreme Lord.

### Synonyms

*ādau* — in the beginning; *abhūt* — He became; *śata*-*dhṛtiḥ* — Lord Brahmā; *rajasā* — by the material mode of passion; *asya* — of this universe; *sarge* — in the creation; *viṣṇuḥ* — Lord Viṣṇu; *sthitau* — in maintenance; *kratu*-*patiḥ* — the Lord of sacrifice; *dvija* — of the twice-born *brāhmaṇas*; *dharma* — of the religious duties; *setuḥ* — the protector; *rudraḥ* — Lord Śiva; *apyayāya* — for annihilation; *tamasā* — by the mode of ignorance; *puruṣaḥ* — the Supreme Person; *saḥ* — He; *ādyaḥ* — original; *iti* — thus; *udbhava*-*sthiti*-*layāḥ* — creation, maintenance and destruction; *satatam* — always; *prajāsu* — among created beings.

### Translation

**In the beginning, the original Supreme Personality manifested the form of Brahmā through the material mode of passion in order to create this universe. The Lord manifested His form as Viṣṇu, the Lord of sacrifice and protector of the twice-born brāhmaṇas and their religious duties, to maintain the universe. And when the universe is to be annihilated the same Supreme Lord employs the material mode of ignorance and manifests the form of Rudra. The created living beings are thus always subject to the forces of creation, maintenance and destruction.**

### Purport

In the previous verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead was described as *ādi-kartā,* the original person responsible for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world. According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, *ādi-kartā,* or “the original doer,” implies subsequent creators, maintainers and annihilators. Otherwise there would be no meaning to the word *ādi,* or “original.” Therefore this verse describes that the Absolute Truth expands Himself into the *guṇāvatāras,* or incarnations who carry out the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the universe through the modes of passion, goodness and ignorance respectively.

It is significant here that although this verse mentions creation through the material mode of passion and annihilation through the material mode of ignorance, it does not mention maintenance by Viṣṇu through the material mode of goodness. That is because Viṣṇu is *viśuddha-sattva,* or existing on the platform of unlimited transcendental goodness. Although Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are somewhat affected by their prescribed duties as superintendents of the modes of nature, Lord Viṣṇu is *viśuddha-sattva,* completely beyond contamination even by the material mode of goodness. As described in the *Vedas,* *na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate:* the Lord has no occupational duty. Whereas Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are understood to be servants of the Lord, Viṣṇu is completely transcendental.

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, Viṣṇu, described in this verse as *kratu-patiḥ,* the Lord of sacrifice, is understood to have appeared in a previous age as the incarnation Suyajña, the son of Prajāpati Ruci. Whereas Brahmā and Śiva faithfully engage in service to the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu is the Supreme Lord Himself, and therefore His activities of maintaining the *brāhmaṇas* and religious principles, as mentioned in this verse (*dvija-dharma-setuḥ*), are not occupational duties but *līlā.* So in addition to being a *guṇāvatāra,* Viṣṇu is also a *līlāvatāra,* according to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. The *Mahābhārata* (*Śānti-parva*) describes the birth of Lord Brahmā from the lotus flower emanating from Viṣṇu and the subsequent birth of Lord Śiva from the angry eyes of Lord Brahmā. Viṣṇu, however, is the self-manifested Personality of Godhead who enters the material universe by His own internal potency, as stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.8.15):

*tal loka-padmaṁ sa u eva viṣṇuḥ  
prāvīviśat sarva-guṇāvabhāsam*

In conclusion, Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme controller whose personal form is full of eternal existence, knowledge and bliss, who is beginningless but is the beginning of everything, who is known as Govinda, and who is the original cause of all causes, as stated in *Brahma-saṁhitā.* Still, that same eternal Lord manifests Himself as Brahmā and Śiva in the sense that the primeval controllers Brahmā and Śiva manifest the potency and supreme will of the Lord, although they themselves are not supreme.

### Translation

**Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, who is perfectly peaceful and is the best of sages, was born as the son of Dharma and his wife Mūrti, the daughter of Dakṣa. Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi taught the devotional service of the Lord, by which material work ceases, and He Himself perfectly practiced this knowledge. He is living even today, His lotus feet served by the greatest of saintly persons.**

### Purport

It is understood that Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi spoke transcendental knowledge to great saintly persons such as Nārada Muni. On the basis of these teachings, Nārada was able to describe *naiṣkarmyam,* or the devotional service of the Lord, which eradicates material work, as mentioned in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.3.8): *tantraṁ sātvatam ācaṣṭa naiṣkarmyaṁ karmaṇāṁ yataḥ.* The *ātma-svarūpa,* or eternal form of the living entity, is devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. But our perception of our eternal form is covered by a material concept of life, just as our normal understanding of our life is covered by a dream. *Naiṣkarmyam,* or the cessation of material work, is possible only by the devotional service of the Lord, as stated by Nārada Muni himself: *naiṣkarmyam apy acyuta-bhāva-varjitaṁ na śobhate jñānam alaṁ nirañjanam* (*Bhāg.* 1.5.12). The process of transforming ordinary *karma* into *naiṣkarmya,* or transcendental work, is summarized by Śrīla Prabhupāda in his commentary on this verse spoken by Nārada Muni. “Fruitive work, in which almost all people in general are engaged, is always painful either in the beginning or at the end. It can be fruitful only when made subservient to the devotional service of the Lord. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* also it is confirmed that the result of such fruitive work may be offered for the service of the Lord, otherwise it leads to material bondage. The bona fide enjoyer of the fruitive work is the Personality of Godhead, and thus when it is engaged for the sense gratification of the living beings, it becomes an acute source of trouble.” According to the *Matsya Purāṇa* (3.10), Dharma, the father of Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, was born from the right breast of Brahmā and later married thirteen of the daughters of Prajāpati Dakṣa. The Lord Himself appeared from the womb of Mūrtidevī.

### Translation

**King Indra became fearful, thinking that Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi would become very powerful by His severe penances and seize Indra’s heavenly kingdom. Thus Indra, not knowing the transcendental glories of the incarnation of the Lord, sent Cupid and his associates to the Lord’s residence in Badarikāśrama. As the charming breezes of spring created a most sensuous atmosphere, Cupid himself attacked the Lord with arrows in the form of the irresistible glances of beautiful women.**

### Purport

This verse and the following nine verses illustrate the Personality of Godhead’s opulence of supreme renunciation. The word *atan-mahi-jñaḥ,* “not understanding the glories of the Lord,” indicates that King Indra was placing the Personality of Godhead on the same level as he himself, considering the Lord an ordinary enjoyer who would be attracted by mundane sex life. Indra’s plot to cause the falldown of Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi could not affect the Lord, but it reveals the shortsightedness of Indra himself. Because Indra is attached to his heavenly kingdom, he took it for granted that the Supreme Lord was performing austerities to acquire such flickering phantasmagoria as the kingdom of heaven (*tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate*).

### Synonyms

*vijñāya* — understanding perfectly; *śakra* — by Indra; *kṛtam* — committed; *akramam* — the offense; *ādi*-*devaḥ* — the original Personality of Godhead; *prāha* — He spoke; *prahasya* — laughing; *gata*-*vismayaḥ* — free from pride; *ejamānān* — to those who were trembling; *mā* *bhaiḥ* — please have no fear; *vibho* — O mighty one; *madana* — Cupid; *māruta* — O god of the wind; *deva*-*vadhvaḥ* — O wives of the demigods; *gṛhṇīta* — please accept; *naḥ* — from Us; *balim* — these gifts; *aśūnyam* — not empty; *imam* — this (*āśrama*); *kurudhvam* — please make.

### Translation

**The primeval Lord, understanding the offense committed by Indra, did not become proud. Instead He spoke laughingly as follows to Cupid and his followers, who were trembling before Him: “Do not fear, O mighty Madana, O wind-god and wives of the demigods. Rather, please accept these gifts I am offering you and kindly sanctify My āśrama by your presence.”**

### Purport

The word *gata-vismayaḥ,* or “free from false pride,” is very significant. If one becomes proud by performing severe penances, such penances are considered material. One should not think, “I am a great, austere personality.” Śrī Nara-Nārāyaṇa could immediately understand the foolishness of Indra, and thus He was amused by the whole situation. Cupid and the heavenly women, understanding their great offense, were trembling before Nara-Nārāyaṇa in fear of receiving a powerful curse. But the Lord, exhibiting most sublime saintly behavior, reassured them by saying, *mā bhaiḥ* — “Don’t worry about it” — and actually offered them nice *prasādam* and articles of worship. “If you do not give Me the opportunity to act as host to the demigods and other respectable personalities,” He said, “what will be the use of My *āśrama*? My *āśrama* will be void without the opportunity to receive respectable personalities such as you.”

Similarly, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is establishing beautiful centers in all the major cities of the world. In some of these centers, such as those in Los Angeles, Bombay, London, Paris and Melbourne, the Society has established very gorgeous preaching *āśramas.* But the Vaiṣṇavas who live in these beautiful buildings feel that the buildings are void if guests do not come to hear about Kṛṣṇa and chant His holy name. Thus, one may establish a beautiful *āśrama* not for one’s personal sense gratification but to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness peacefully and encourage others to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness also.

### Translation

**My dear King Nimi, when Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi thus spoke, eradicating the fear of the demigods, they bowed their heads with shame and addressed the Lord as follows, to invoke His compassion: Our dear Lord, You are always transcendental, beyond the reach of illusion, and therefore You are forever changeless. Your causeless compassion toward us, despite our great offense, is not at all unusual in You, since innumerable great sages who are self-satisfied and free from anger and false pride bow down humbly at Your lotus feet.**

### Purport

The demigods said, “Our dear Lord, although ordinary living entities such as the demigods and ordinary men are always disturbed by material pride and anger, You are always transcendental. Therefore it is not surprising that we fallible demigods could not appreciate Your glories.”

### Translation

**The demigods place many obstacles on the path of those who worship You to transcend the temporary abodes of the demigods and reach Your supreme abode. Those who offer the demigods their assigned shares in sacrificial performances encounter no such obstacles. But because You are the direct protector of Your devotee, he is able to step over the head of whatever obstacle the demigods place before him.**

### Purport

The demigods, headed by Kāmadeva, or Cupid, recognizing their offense at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, here point out the insignificant position of the demigods in relation to the Supreme Lord. Just as a farmer must pay a specific percentage of his agricultural profit to the king or political head as tax money, all human beings must offer a percentage of their material wealth to the demigods in sacrifice. In *Bhagavad-gītā,* however, the Lord explains that the demigods are also His servants and it is He Himself who awards all benedictions, through the agency of the demigods. *Mayaiva vihitān hi tān.* Although a Vaiṣṇava, or devotee of the Lord, has no need to worship the demigods, the demigods, being proud of their exalted material position, sometimes resent the exclusive devotion of the Vaiṣṇava to the Lord and thus try to cause the devotee to fall down, as described in this verse (*sura-kṛtā bahavo ’ntarāyāḥ*). But the demigods here point out that Kṛṣṇa is directly the protector of His devotees. Therefore, so-called impediments become stimuli for further spiritual advancement for a sincere devotee.

The demigods here state, “We thought, our dear Lord, that we could disturb Your consciousness by our foolish tricks. But by Your mercy even Your devotees pay little regard to us, so why should You take our foolish behavior seriously?” The word *yadi* here is used to indicate the certainty that Kṛṣṇa is always the protector of His surrendered devotees. Although there may be many obstacles on the path of the sincere devotee who is preaching the glories of the Lord, such obstacles increase the determination of the devotee. Therefore, according to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the continuous obstacles presented by the demigods form a kind of ladder or stairway upon which the devotee steadily progresses back to the kingdom of God. A similar verse appears in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (10.2.33):

*tathā na te mādhava tāvakāḥ kvacid  
bhraśyanti mārgāt tvayi baddha-sauhṛdāḥ  
tvayābhiguptā vicaranti nirbhayā  
vināyakānīkapa-mūrdhasu prabho*

“O Mādhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.”

### Synonyms

*kṣut* — hunger; *tṛṭ* — thirst; *tri*-*kāla*-*guṇa* — the manifestations of the three phases of time (such as heat and cold, rain and so on); *māruta* — wind; *jaihva* — enjoyment of the tongue; *śaiṣṇān* — and of the genitals; *asmān* — ourselves (in all these forms); *apāra* — limitless; *jala*-*dhīn* — oceans; *atitīrya* — having crossed over; *kecit* — some persons; *krodhasya* — of anger; *yānti* — they come; *viphalasya* — which is fruitless; *vaśam* — under the sway; *pade* — in the foot(print); *goḥ* — of a cow; *majjanti* — they drown; *duścara* — difficult to execute; *tapaḥ* — their austerities; *ca* — and; *vṛthā* — without any good purpose; *utsṛjanti* — they throw away.

### Translation

**Some men practice severe penances to cross beyond our influence, which is like an immeasurable ocean with endless waves of hunger, thirst, heat, cold and the other conditions brought about by the passing of time, such as the sensuous wind and the urges of the tongue and sex organs. Nevertheless, although crossing this ocean of sense gratification through severe penances, such persons foolishly drown in a cow’s hoofprint when conquered by useless anger. Thus they exhaust the benefit of their difficult austerities in vain.**

### Purport

Those who do not accept the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can be considered in two categories. Those engaged in sense gratification are easily conquered by the demigods through various weapons such as hunger, thirst, sexual desire, lamentation for the past and vain hoping for the future. Such materialistic fools, infatuated with the material world, are easily controlled by the demigods, who are the ultimate supplying agents of sense gratification. But according to Śrīdhara Svāmī, persons who attempt to subdue the desires of the material senses and thus avoid the control of the demigods without surrendering to the Supreme Lord are even more foolish than the sense gratifiers. Although crossing the ocean of sense gratification, those who perform severe penances without service to the Lord eventually drown in tiny puddles of anger. One who simply performs material penances does not actually purify his heart. By one’s material determination one may restrict the activities of the senses although one’s heart is still filled with material desires. The practical result of this is *krodha,* or anger. We have seen artificial performers of penance who have become very bitter and angry through denial of the senses. Being indifferent to the Supreme Lord, such persons do not achieve ultimate liberation, nor can they enjoy material sense gratification; rather, they become angry, and through cursing others or enjoying false pride they uselessly exhaust the results of their painful austerities. It is understood that when a *yogī* curses he diminishes the mystic power he has accumulated. Thus, anger gives neither liberation nor material sense gratification but merely burns up all the results of material penances and austerities. Being useless, such anger is compared to a useless puddle found in a cow’s hoofprint. Thus after crossing over the ocean of sense gratification the great *yogīs* who are indifferent to the Supreme Lord drown in puddles of anger. Although the demigods admit that the devotees of the Lord actually conquer the miseries of material life, it is understood here that a similar result is not to be obtained by so-called *yogīs* who are not interested in devotional service to the Supreme Lord.

Lord Nara-Nārāyaṇa showed His causeless mercy toward the demigods by relieving them of their false prestige. Although the demigods were proud of their personal beauty and female companions, the Lord showed that He was already being adequately served by innumerable gorgeous females, each of whom was far more beautiful than any female companion imagined by the demigods. The Lord manifested such uniquely attractive women through His own mystic potency.

### Purport

Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi was almost laughing upon seeing the defeat of the demigods. However, being extremely grave, He did not actually laugh. Although the demigods might have thought, “We are simply low-class fools in comparison to these women,” the Lord encouraged them to choose one of the women, whomever they considered equal in character to themselves. The beauty thus selected would become the ornament of heaven.

*bhūmeḥ* — of the earth; *bhara* — the burden; *avataraṇāya* — to diminish; *yaduṣu* — in the Yadu dynasty; *ajanmā* — the unborn Lord; *jātaḥ* — taking birth; *kariṣyati* — He will perform; *suraiḥ* — by the demigods; *api* — even; *duṣkarāṇi* — difficult deeds; *vādaiḥ* — by speculative arguments; *vimohayati* — He will bewilder; *yajña*-*kṛtaḥ* — the performers of Vedic sacrifices; *atat*-*arhān* — who are unfit to be so engaged; *śūdrān* — the low-class men; *kalau* — in the degraded Age of Kali; *kṣiti*-*bhujaḥ* — rulers; *nyahaniṣyat* — He will kill; *ante* — at the end.

### Translation

**To diminish the burden of the earth, the unborn Lord will take birth in the Yadu dynasty and perform feats impossible even for the demigods. Propounding speculative philosophy, the Lord, as Buddha, will bewilder the unworthy performers of Vedic sacrifices. And as Kalki the Lord will kill all the low-class men posing as rulers at the end of the Age of Kali.**

### Purport

It is understood that in this verse the description of the Lord’s appearance in the Yadu dynasty refers to the appearance of both Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, who together removed the demoniac rulers who were burdening the earth. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has pointed out that the description of the incarnations to deal with *śūdrān,* or low-class men, refers to both Buddha and Kalki. Those who misuse Vedic sacrifice to engage in gross sense gratification, such as the sinful killing of animals, are certainly in the category of *śūdra,* as are the so-called political leaders of Kali-yuga who perform many atrocities in the name of state management.
