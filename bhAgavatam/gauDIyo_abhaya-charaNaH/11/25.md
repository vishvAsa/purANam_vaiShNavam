title = "25 The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond"
+++
CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE

To establish the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this chapter describes the various functional manifestations of the three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), which arise in the mind.

Control of the mind, control of the senses, tolerance and so forth are manifestations of the unmixed mode of goodness. Desire, endeavor, false pride and so on are manifestations of the unmixed mode of passion. And anger, greed and bewilderment are among the functions of the unmixed mode of ignorance. In the admixture of the three modes we find the concept of “I” and “my,” behavior in accordance with this mentality by body, mind and words, adherence to the principles of religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, and the fixed pursuit of one’s occupational duty for material interest.

A person whose character is in the mode of goodness worships Lord Hari in a spirit of devotion, without regard to profit. On the other hand, one who hankers after the fruits of his worship of the Lord is passionate by nature. And one who desires violence is in the mode of ignorance. These modes of goodness, passion and ignorance are present in the infinitesimal living entity, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the three modes of material nature.

The substance, place and result of activity, along with the time, the knowledge underlying action, the activity itself, the performer, his faith, his level of awareness, his spiritual progress and his destination after death, all partake of the three modes and manifest variously in terms of distinctions and hierarchies. But objects related to the Supreme Personality, places connected with Him, happiness based on Him, the time occupied in His worship, knowledge related to Him, work offered to Him, the performer of work who acts under His shelter, faith in His devotional service, progress toward the spiritual realm, and the destination of the Supreme Lord’s personal abode all transcend the material modes.

There are many different destinations and conditions of life for the spirit soul within the cycle of material existence. These are all based on the modes of nature and on fruitive activities, which are governed by the modes. It is only by practicing the *yoga* of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord that one can conquer the three modes, which arise originally from the mind. After obtaining a human body, which has the potential for developing knowledge and realization, a person who is intelligent should renounce association with the three modes of nature and then worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First, by increasing the mode of goodness, one can defeat passion and ignorance. Then one can conquer material goodness by evolving his consciousness to the platform of transcendence. At that time he becomes entirely liberated from the material modes, gives up his subtle body (the material mind, intelligence and false ego) and attains the association of the Personality of Godhead. By the shattering of his subtle covering, the living entity is able to come face to face with the Supreme Lord and thus achieve absolute fulfillment by His grace.

श्रीभगवानुवाच  
गुणानामसम्मिश्राणां पुमान् येन यथा भवेत् ।  
तन्मे पुरुषवर्येदमुपधारय शंसत- ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
*guṇānām asammiśrāṇāṁ  
pumān yena yathā bhavet  
tan me puruṣa-varyedam  
upadhāraya śaṁsataḥ*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *guṇānām* — of the modes of nature; *asammiśrāṇām* — in their unmixed state; *pumān* — a person; *yena* — by which mode; *yathā* — how; *bhavet* — he becomes; *tat* — that; *me* — by Me; *puruṣa*-*varya* — O best among men; *idam* — this; *upadhāraya* — please try to understand; *śaṁsataḥ* — as I speak.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O best among men, please listen as I describe to you how the living entity attains a particular nature by association with individual material modes.**

### Purport

The word *asammiśra* indicates that which is not mixed with anything else. Lord Kṛṣṇa now explains how each of the three material modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), acting separately, causes a conditioned soul to manifest a particular type of existence. The living entity is ultimately transcendental to the modes of nature, being part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but in conditioned life he manifests material qualities. This is described in the following verses.

सन्निपातस्त्वहमिति ममेत्युद्धव या मति- ।  
व्यवहार- सन्निपातो मनोमात्रेन्द्रियासुभि- ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*sannipātas tv aham iti  
mamety uddhava yā matiḥ  
vyavahāraḥ sannipāto  
mano-mātrendriyāsubhiḥ*

### Synonyms

*sannipātaḥ* — the combination of the modes; *tu* — and; *aham* *iti* — “I”; *mama* *iti* — “mine”; *uddhava* — O Uddhava; *yā* — which; *matiḥ* — mentality; *vyavahāraḥ* — ordinary activities; *sannipātaḥ* — the combination; *manaḥ* — by the mind; *mātrā* — the objects of perception; *indriya* — the senses; *asubhiḥ* — and the vital airs.

### Translation

**My dear Uddhava, the combination of all three modes is present in the mentality of “I” and “mine.” The ordinary transactions of this world, which are carried out through the agency of the mind, the objects of perception, the senses and the vital airs of the physical body, are also based on the combination of the modes.**

### Purport

The illusory concept of “I” and “mine” occurs by the mixture of the three modes of nature. A person in goodness may feel, “I am peaceful.” One in passion may think, “I am lusty.” And one in ignorance may think, “I am angry.” Similarly, one may think “my peace,” “my lust” or “my anger.” One completely absorbed in the mentality of being peaceful could not work in the material world; he would lack any impulse to perform activity. Similarly, one absorbed in lust would be blinded without at least a tinge of peacefulness or restraint. One overwhelmed with anger could not function properly in the material world without the mixture of other qualities. Thus we find that a material mode does not occur in a pure, isolated form but rather is mixed with other modes, thereby making possible normal functioning within this world. Ultimately one should think, “I am an eternal servant of Lord Kṛṣṇa” and “My only possession is loving service to the Lord.” This is the pure state of consciousness, beyond the material modes of nature.

### Purport

Religiosity, economic development and sense gratification are situated within the modes of nature, and the faith, wealth and enjoyment obtained by them clearly reveal the particular situation of a person within the modes of nature.

### Translation

**When a man desires sense gratification, being attached to family life, and when he consequently becomes established in religious and occupational duties, the combination of the modes of nature is manifest.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, religious duties performed for promotion to heaven are understood to be in the mode of passion, those performed to enjoy ordinary family life are in the mode of ignorance, and those performed selflessly to fulfill one’s occupational duty in the *varṇāśrama* system are in the mode of goodness. The Lord has thus explained how mundane religiosity is manifest within the modes of nature.

## Text 12

### Devanagari

सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणा जीवस्य नैव मे ।  
चित्तजा यैस्तु भूतानां सज्जमानो निबध्यते ॥ १२ ॥

### Verse text

*sattvaṁ rajas tama iti  
guṇā jīvasya naiva me  
citta-jā yais tu bhūtānāṁ  
sajjamāno nibadhyate*

### Synonyms

*sattvam* — the mode of goodness; *rajaḥ* — the mode of passion; *tamaḥ* — the mode of ignorance; *iti* — thus; *guṇāḥ* — the modes; *jīvasya* — pertaining to the spirit soul; *na* — not; *eva* — indeed; *me* — to Me; *citta*-*jāḥ* — manifest within the mind; *yaiḥ* — by which modes; *tu* — and; *bhūtānām* — to material creations; *sajjamānaḥ* — becoming attached; *nibadhyate* — one is bound up.

### Translation

**The three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance — influence the living entity but not Me. Manifesting within his mind, they induce the living entity to become attached to material bodies and other created objects. In this way the living entity is bound up.**

### Purport

The living entity is the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, having the tendency to be overwhelmed by the Lord’s illusory material energy. The Personality of Godhead, however, is the absolute controller of illusion. Illusion can never control the Lord. Thus the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is the eternal object of service for all living beings, who are eternally servants of the Lord.

The three modes of nature manifest within the material energy. When a conditioned soul adopts a material mentality, the modes exert their influence within the jurisdiction of that mentality. But if one purifies one’s mind in the devotional service of the Lord, the modes of nature can no longer act upon him, since they have no influence on the spiritual platform.

### Translation

**It should be understood that alert wakefulness comes from the mode of goodness, sleep with dreaming from the mode of passion, and deep, dreamless sleep from the mode of ignorance. The fourth state of consciousness pervades these three and is transcendental.**

Our original Kṛṣṇa consciousness exists eternally within the soul, and it is also present in all the three phases of awareness, namely normal wakefulness, dreaming and dreamless sleep. Being covered by the modes of nature, this spiritual consciousness may not be manifest, but it continues to exist eternally as the real nature of the living entity.

**Learned persons dedicated to Vedic culture are elevated by the mode of goodness to higher and higher positions. The mode of ignorance, on the other hand, forces one to fall headfirst into lower and lower births. And by the mode of passion one continues transmigrating through human bodies.**

### Purport

*Śūdras,* persons in the mode of ignorance, are generally in deep illusion about the purpose of life, accepting the gross material body as the self. Those in passion and ignorance are called *vaiśyas* and hanker intensely for wealth, whereas *kṣatriyas,* who are in the mode of passion, are eager for prestige and power. Those in the mode of goodness, however, hanker after perfect knowledge; they are therefore called *brāhmaṇas.* Such a person is promoted up to the supreme material position of Brahmaloka, the planet of Lord Brahmā. One who is in the mode of ignorance gradually falls to the level of unmoving species, such as trees and stones, while one in the mode of passion, filled with material desire but satisfying it within Vedic culture, is allowed to remain in human society.

### Synonyms

### Translation

**Absolute knowledge is in the mode of goodness, knowledge based on duality is in the mode of passion, and foolish, materialistic knowledge is in the mode of ignorance. Knowledge based upon Me, however, is understood to be transcendental.**

### Purport

The Lord clearly explains here that spiritual knowledge of His supreme personality is transcendental to ordinary religious knowledge in the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness one understands the existence of a higher spiritual nature within all things. In the mode of passion one acquires scientific knowledge of the material body. And in the mode of ignorance one fixes one’s mind on the sense objects without higher awareness, perceiving things as a small child or a retarded person does.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī elaborately explains in his commentary on this verse that the material mode of goodness does not award perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. He quotes from *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.14.2), proving that many great demigods in the mode of goodness could not understand the transcendental personality of Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the material mode of goodness, one becomes pious or religious, aware of a higher, spiritual nature. On the spiritual platform of purified goodness, however, one establishes a direct, loving relationship with the Absolute Truth, rendering service to the Lord rather than merely maintaining a connection to mundane piety. In the mode of passion the conditioned soul speculates about the reality of his own existence and of the world around him, and considers speculatively the existence of a kingdom of God. In the mode of ignorance one acquires knowledge for sense gratification, absorbing the mind in varieties of eating, sleeping, defending and sex, without any higher purpose. Thus, within the modes of nature the conditioned souls are trying to gratify their senses, or else they are trying to free themselves from sense gratification. But they cannot directly engage themselves in their constitutional, liberated activities until they come to the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, beyond the modes of nature.

वनं तु सात्त्विको वासो ग्रामो राजस उच्यते ।

### Verse text

*vanaṁ tu sāttviko vāso  
grāmo rājasa ucyate  
tāmasaṁ dyūta-sadanaṁ  
man-niketaṁ tu nirguṇam*

### Synonyms

*vanam* — the forest; *tu* — whereas; *sāttvikaḥ* — in the mode of goodness; *vāsaḥ* — residence; *grāmaḥ* — the village neighborhood; *rājasaḥ* — in the mode of passion; *ucyate* — is said; *tāmasam* — in the mode of ignorance; *dyūta*-*sadanam* — the gambling house; *mat*-*niketam* — My residence; *tu* — but; *nirguṇam* — transcendental.

### Translation

**Residence in the forest is in the mode of goodness, residence in a town is in the mode of passion, residence in a gambling house displays the quality of ignorance, and residence in a place where I reside is transcendental.**

### Purport

Many creatures in the forest, such as the trees, wild boars and insects, are actually in the modes of passion and ignorance. But residence in the forest is designated as being in the mode of goodness because there one may live a solitary life free from sinful activities, material opulence and passionate ambition. Throughout the history of India, many millions of persons from all walks of life have adopted the orders of *vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* and have gone to sacred forests to practice austerity and perfect their self-realization. Even in America and other Western countries, persons such as Thoreau achieved fame by retiring to the forest to reduce the scope and opulence of material involvement.

The word *grāma* here indicates residence in the village of one’s family. Family life is certainly full of false pride, false hopes, false affection, lamentation and illusion, since the family connection is squarely resting on the bodily concept of life, the very opposite of self-realization. The word *dyūta-sadanam,* “gambling house,” refers to pool halls, racetracks, poker clubs, bars and other sinful places that maintain an abysmal level of consciousness in the mode of ignorance. *Man-niketam* refers to the Lord’s own abode in the spiritual world as well as the Lord’s temples within this world, wherein the Deity form of the Lord is appropriately worshiped. One who lives in the temple of Lord Kṛṣṇa, following the rules and regulations of temple life, is understood to be residing on the transcendental platform. In these verses the Lord clearly explains that all material phenomena may be divided into three divisions according to the modes of nature, and that ultimately there is the fourth, or transcendental, division — Kṛṣṇa consciousness — which elevates all aspects of human culture to the liberated platform.

### Translation

**A worker free of attachment is in the mode of goodness, a worker blinded by personal desire is in the mode of passion, and a worker who has completely forgotten how to tell right from wrong is in the mode of ignorance. But a worker who has taken shelter of Me is understood to be transcendental to the modes of nature.**

### Purport

A transcendental worker performs his activities in strict accordance with the directions of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the Lord’s bona fide representatives. Taking shelter of the Lord’s guidance, such a worker remains transcendental to the material modes of nature.

**O gentle Uddhava, all these different phases of conditioned life arise from work born of the modes of material nature. The living entity who conquers these modes, manifested from the mind, can dedicate himself to Me by the process of devotional service and thus attain pure love for Me.**

### Purport

The words *mad-bhāvāya prapadyate* indicate the attainment of love for God or of the same state of existence as that of the Supreme Lord. Actual liberation is residence within the eternal kingdom of God, where life is full of bliss and knowledge. The conditioned soul falsely imagines himself to be the enjoyer of the modes of nature, and thus a particular type of material work is generated, the reaction of which binds the conditioned soul to repeated birth and death. This fruitless process can be counteracted by loving service to the Lord, as described here.

### Purport

The human form of life is a rare opportunity for achieving spiritual liberation in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Lord Kṛṣṇa has elaborately described in this chapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and the transcendental situation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, by which process we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Three Modes of Nature and Beyond.”*
