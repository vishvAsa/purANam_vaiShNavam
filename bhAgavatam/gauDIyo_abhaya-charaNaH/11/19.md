title = "19 The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge"

CHAPTER NINETEEN

This chapter describes how those who practice speculative knowledge eventually give up their method, whereas the pure devotees remain engaged in devotional service eternally. Also described are the different practices of the *yogīs,* beginning with *yama.*

The Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, stated to Uddhava, “One who is actually wise, who knows the truth of the self and possesses transcendental insight, rejects this world of dualities and the so-called knowledge meant for facilitating enjoyment of it. He instead engages himself in trying to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all. This is pure *bhakti-yoga.* Transcendental knowledge is greater than such ordinary pious activities as chanting of *mantras,* but pure devotional service is greater than even knowledge.”

After this, Lord Kṛṣṇa, requested by Śrī Uddhava to describe in full detail pure transcendental knowledge and devotional service, related the same instructions that the greatest of Vaiṣṇavas, Bhīṣmadeva, gave on these topics to Śrī Yudhiṣṭhira on the occasion of the battle at Kurukṣetra. Following this, after being asked about *yama* and the other practices of *yoga,* the Lord enumerated the twelve kinds of *yama* beginning with nonviolence, and the twelve kinds of *niyama,* beginning with bodily cleanliness.

श्रीभगवानुवाच  
यो विद्याश्रुतसम्पन्न- आत्मवान् नानुमानिक- ।  
मायामात्रमिदं ज्ञात्वा ज्ञानं च मयि सन्न्यसेत् ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
*yo vidyā-śruta-sampannaḥ  
ātmavān nānumānikaḥ  
māyā-mātram idaṁ jñātvā  
jñānaṁ ca mayi sannyaset*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *yaḥ* — one who; *vidyā* — with realized knowledge; *śruta* — and preliminary scriptural knowledge; *sampannaḥ* — endowed; *ātma*-*vān* — self-realized; *na* — not; *ānumānikaḥ* — engaged in impersonal speculation; *māyā* — illusion; *mātram* — only; *idam* — this universe; *jñātvā* — knowing; *jñānam* — such knowledge and the means of achieving it; *ca* — also; *mayi* — to Me; *sannyaset* — one should surrender.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: A self-realized person who has cultivated scriptural knowledge up to the point of enlightenment and who is free from impersonal speculation, understanding the material universe to be simply illusion, should surrender unto Me both that knowledge and the means by which he achieved it.**

### Purport

*Māyā-mātram idaṁ jñātvā* indicates knowledge that the eternal spirit soul and the eternal Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the temporary qualities of the material world. The word *vidyā-śruta-sampanna* means that one should cultivate Vedic knowledge for the purpose of enlightenment and not to make a show of mysticism, intellectuality or impersonal speculation. Having neutralized the illusory effects of *māyā,* one should then transfer one’s attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, surrendering the process of philosophical negation to the Lord Himself. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives the example that when there is danger the king may issue weapons to private citizens, but after military victory the individual citizens return the weapons to the king.

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains this point of this verse as follows. Somehow or other the living entity has to free himself from material illusion, which has covered him since time immemorial. Cultivating desirelessness and renunciation by practice of the mystic *yoga* system, the living entity develops knowledge of illusion and may thus lift himself above the reach of material ignorance. However, once one is situated on the transcendental platform, both knowledge of illusion and the process of acquiring such knowledge have no further practical application. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the example that a man may be haunted by the ghost of a snake or a tiger. As long as the man is possessed and thinks, “I am a snake” or “I am a tiger,” attempts will be made to counteract the ghostly influence by application of jewels, *mantras* and herbs. But when the man is freed from possession by ghosts, he again thinks, “I am Mr. So-and-so, the son of Mr. So-and-so,” and returns to his original nature. At that time the jewels, *mantras* and herbs have no further immediate application. The word *vidyā* in this verse thus indicates knowledge acquired through philosophical analysis, mystic *yoga,* austerities and renunciation. Such knowledge of the temporary, illusory nature of this world counteracts ignorance, and there are many Vedic scriptures that train the living entity in such knowledge. Gradually one gives up his false identification with the material body and mind and with those material objects that interact with the body and mind. Having realized such counteractive knowledge, one must engage in the loving service of the Personality of Godhead and become a pure devotee. When one is completely perfect in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is naturally little interest in the innumerable details of illusion, and gradually one is transferred to the spiritual world.

*jñāninas tv aham eveṣṭaḥ  
svārtho hetuś ca sammataḥ  
svargaś caivāpavargaś ca  
nānyo ’rtho mad-ṛte priyaḥ*

### Synonyms

*jñāninaḥ* — of a learned self-realized philosopher; *tu* — indeed; *aham* — I; *eva* — alone; *iṣṭaḥ* — the object of worship; *sva*-*arthaḥ* — the desired goal of life; *hetuḥ* — the means for achieving the goal of life; *ca* — also; *sammataḥ* — the settled conclusion; *svargaḥ* — the cause of all happiness in elevation to heaven; *ca* — also; *eva* — indeed; *apavargaḥ* — freedom from all unhappiness; *ca* — also; *na* — not; *anyaḥ* — any other; *arthaḥ* — purpose; *mat* — Me; *rte* — without; *priyaḥ* — dear object.

### Translation

**For learned, self-realized philosophers I am the only object of worship, the desired goal of life, the means for achieving that goal, and the settled conclusion of all knowledge. Indeed, because I am the cause of their happiness and their freedom from unhappiness, such learned souls have no effective purpose or dear object in life except Me.**

### Purport

In the previous verse Lord Kṛṣṇa stated that one should ultimately surrender unto Him that knowledge by which the material world is seen as illusion. Material attachments are certainly problems for the living entities, since they are diseases of the spirit soul. One who has contracted a skin disease that causes terrible itching gains only flickering relief by scratching the unbearable sores. If he does not scratch he suffers greatly, but by scratching, even though there is an instantaneous sensation of pleasure, unbearable misery follows as the itching increases. Real happiness is not found in scratching one’s skin infections but rather in becoming free from such disease. Conditioned souls are harassed by many illusory desires, and in desperation they try to gratify their senses through the hopeless scratching processes of illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. They further try to gain relief through material society, friendship and love, but the result is unbearable suffering. Real happiness is to eliminate completely the itching disease of material desire. Since material desire is a disease of the soul, one must acquire knowledge to treat this disease and eliminate it. Such therapeutic knowledge is essential as long as one is diseased, but when one is fully healthy, such technical medical knowledge is no longer interesting to the healthy person, and he may leave such knowledge to the doctors. Similarly, in the advanced stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness one need not think continually of one’s personal problems but may rather think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, with love and devotion. Lord Kṛṣṇa advises in the previous verse that one should eliminate one’s personal problems through technical knowledge of illusion. After giving up constant meditation on such problems, one can then become a lover of God. Lord Kṛṣṇa certainly guides each and every sincere devotee internally within the heart and externally through the bona fide spiritual master. In this way, Lord Kṛṣṇa gradually trains His sincere devotees to give up their irrational attachment to dead matter. Once freedom has been achieved, a devotee begins to seriously cultivate his relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual sky.

One may falsely think that just as at a certain stage of advancement one ceases to concentrate on technical, analytic knowledge of illusion, so, at another stage one may give up loving devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. To nullify such speculation Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa here states in various ways that He is the supreme eternal goal of all truly learned human beings. Indeed, the most prominent scholars within the universe are the sages, such as the four Kumāras, who accept Lord Kṛṣṇa as their only worshipable object. Because they have discovered that they are eternal fragmental portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, they are not interested in fruitive activities and mental speculation. Lord Kṛṣṇa awards celestial bliss and freedom from anxiety to His sincere followers, who have no purpose or beloved object in life other than the Lord.

ज्ञानविज्ञानसंसिद्धा- पदं श्रेष्ठं विदुर्मम ।  
ज्ञानी प्रियतमोऽतो मे ज्ञानेनासौ बिभर्ति माम् ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*jñāna-vijñāna-saṁsiddhāḥ  
padaṁ śreṣṭhaṁ vidur mama  
jñānī priyatamo ’to me  
jñānenāsau bibharti mām*

### Synonyms

*jñāna* — in scriptural knowledge; *vijñāna* — and realized spiritual understanding; *saṁsiddhāḥ* — completely perfected; *padam* — the lotus feet; *śreṣṭham* — the supreme object; *viduḥ* — they know; *mama* — My; *jñānī* — a learned transcendentalist; *priya*-*tamaḥ* — most dear; *ataḥ* — thus; *me* — to Me; *jñānena* — by spiritual knowledge; *asau* — that learned person; *bibharti* — maintains (in happiness); *mām* — Me.

### Translation

**Those who have achieved complete perfection through philosophical and realized knowledge recognize My lotus feet to be the supreme transcendental object. Thus the learned transcendentalist is most dear to Me, and by his perfect knowledge he maintains Me in happiness.**

### Purport

The words *padaṁ śreṣṭhaṁ vidur mama* (“they recognize My lotus feet to be supreme”) certainly eliminate the impersonalist philosophers from the category of *saṁsiddhāḥ,* or completely perfected philosophers. Lord Kṛṣṇa here refers to such great transcendental scholars as the four Kumāras, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Śrī Vyāsadeva, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura and Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. The Lord similarly states in *Bhagavad-gītā* (7.17-18):

*teṣām jñānī nitya-yukta  
eka-bhaktir viśiṣyate  
priyo hi jñānino ’ty-artham  
ahaṁ sa ca mama priyaḥ*

“Of these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.”

*udārāḥ sarva evaite  
jñānī tv ātmaiva me matam  
āsthitaḥ sa hi yuktātmā  
mām evānuttamāṁ gatim*

“All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he attains Me.”

*Jñāna* refers to an authorized philosophical and analytic perception of reality, and when such knowledge is clearly realized through the sanctification of consciousness the resultant comprehensive experience is called *vijñāna.* Speculative, impersonal knowledge does not actually purify the heart of the living entity but rather merges him ever deeper into forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a father is always proud of his son’s education, similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes very happy to see the living entities acquiring a sound spiritual education and thus making progress on the way back home, back to Godhead.

*tapas tīrthaṁ japo dānaṁ  
pavitrāṇītarāṇi ca  
nālaṁ kurvanti tāṁ siddhiṁ  
yā jñāna-kalayā kṛtā*

### Synonyms

*tapaḥ* — austerity; *tīrtham* — visiting holy places; *japaḥ* — offering silent prayers; *dānam* — charity; *pavitrāṇi* — pious activities; *itarāṇi* — other; *ca* — also; *na* — not; *alam* — up to the same standard; *kurvanti* — they award; *tām* — this; *siddhim* — perfection; *yā* — which; *jñāna* — of spiritual knowledge; *kalayā* — by a fraction; *kṛtā* — is awarded.

### Translation

**That perfection which is produced by a small fraction of spiritual knowledge cannot be duplicated by performing austerities, visiting holy places, chanting silent prayers, giving in charity or engaging in other pious activities.**

### Purport

*Jñāna* here refers to a clear understanding of the Lord’s supreme dominion over all that be, and this realized knowledge is nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That the Lord is supreme is confirmed in the previous verse by the words *padam śreṣṭhaṁ vidur mama.* One may perform penances or visit holy places with a proud mentality or material motivation; similarly, one may chant prayers to God, give charity or perform other externally pious activities with many bizarre, hypocritical or even demoniac motivations. Realized knowledge of the supremacy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, is a solid connection with the spiritual world, and if one pursues this holy understanding one is gradually promoted to the highest level of conscious existence, called Vaikuṇṭha, or the kingdom of God.

*tasmāj jñānena sahitaṁ  
jñātvā svātmānam uddhava  
jñāna-vijñāna-sampanno

### Synonyms

*tasmāt* — therefore; *jñānena* — knowledge; *sahitam* — with; *jñātvā* — knowing; *sva*-*ātmānam* — your own self; *uddhava* — My dear Uddhava; *jñāna* — in Vedic knowledge; *vijñāna* — and clear realization; *sampannaḥ* — accomplished; *bhaja* — worship; *mām* — Me; *bhakti* — of loving devotion; *bhāvataḥ* — in the mood.

### Translation

**Therefore, My dear Uddhava, through knowledge you should understand your actual self. Then, advancing by clear realization of Vedic knowledge, you should worship Me in the mood of loving devotion.**

### Purport

The word *vijñāna* indicates realized knowledge of one’s original, spiritual form. Every living entity has an eternal spiritual form, which lies dormant until one arouses one’s original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Without knowledge of one’s own spiritual personality it is not possible to cultivate love of the Supreme Personality, Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the words *jñātvā svātmānam* are significant here, indicating that every living entity can realize his full potential as an individual person only in the kingdom of God.

### Translation

**Formerly, great sages, through the sacrifice of Vedic knowledge and spiritual enlightenment, worshiped Me within themselves, knowing Me to be the Supreme Lord of all sacrifice and the Supersoul in everyone’s heart. Thus coming to Me, these sages achieved the supreme perfection.**

### Synonyms

*tvayi* — in you; *uddhava* — O Uddhava; *āśrayati* — enters and remains; *yaḥ* — which; *tri*-*vidhaḥ* — in three divisions, according to the modes of nature; *vikāraḥ* — (the material body and mind, which are subject to) constant transformation; *māyā* — illusion; *antarā* — during the present; *āpatati* — suddenly appears; *na* — not; *ādi* — in the beginning; *apavargayoḥ* — nor at the end; *yat* — since; *janma* — birth; *ādayaḥ* — and so on (growth, procreation, maintenance, dwindling and death); *asya* — of the body; *yat* — when; *amī* — these; *tava* — in relation to you; *tasya* — in relation to your spiritual nature; *kim* — what relationship; *syuḥ* — could they have; *ādi* — in the beginning; *antayoḥ* — and in the end; *yat* — since; *asataḥ* — of that which does not exist; *asti* — exists; *tat* — that; *eva* — indeed; *madhye* — only in the middle, at present.

### Translation

**My dear Uddhava, the material body and mind, composed of the three modes of material nature, attach themselves to you, but they are actually illusion, since they appear only at the present, having no original or ultimate existence. How is it possible, therefore, that the various stages of the body, namely birth, growth, reproduction, maintenance, dwindling and death, can have any relation to your eternal self? These phases relate only to the material body, which previously did not exist and ultimately will not exist. The body exists merely at the present moment.**

### Purport

The example is given that a man walking in the forest may see a rope but consider it to be a snake. Such perception is *māyā,* or illusion, although the rope actually exists and a snake also exists in another place. Illusion thus refers to the false identification of one object with another. The material body exists briefly and then disappears. In the past the body did not exist, and in the future it will not exist; it enjoys a flickering, momentary existence in so-called present time. If we falsely identify ourselves as the material body or mind, we are creating an illusion. One who identifies himself as American, Russian, Chinese, Mexican, black or white, man or woman, communist or capitalist, and so on, accepting such designations as his permanent identity, is certainly in deep illusion. He can be compared to a sleeping man who sees himself acting in a different body while dreaming. In the previous verse Lord Kṛṣṇa told Uddhava that spiritual knowledge is the means of achieving the highest perfection, and now the Lord is explicitly describing such knowledge.

Please explain to me that process of knowledge which automatically brings detachment and direct perception of the truth, which is transcendental, and which is traditional among great spiritual philosophers. This knowledge, sought by elevated personalities, describes loving devotional service unto Your Lordship.**

### Purport

Those who are able to cross over the darkness of material existence are called *mahat,* or great personalities. Secondary items like cosmic consciousness or universal control do not deviate the attention of such great souls from loving service to the Lord. Śrī Uddhava desires to hear knowledge of the eternal religious principles that are the traditional aim and objective of all superior personalities.

### Synonyms

*tāpa* — by the miseries; *trayeṇa* — threefold; *abhihatasya* — of one overwhelmed; *ghore* — which is terrible; *santapyamānasya* — being tormented; *bhava* — of material existence; *adhvani* — in the path; *īśa* — O Lord; *paśyāmi* — I see; *na* — none; *anyat* — other; *śaraṇam* — shelter; *tava* — Your; *aṅghri* — lotus feet; *dvandva* — of the two; *ātapatrāt* — than the umbrella; *amṛta* — of nectar; *abhivarṣāt* — the shower.

### Translation

**My dear Lord, for one who is being tormented on the terrible path of birth and death and is constantly overwhelmed by the threefold miseries, I do not see any possible shelter other than Your two lotus feet, which are just like a refreshing umbrella that pours down showers of delicious nectar.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa, recognizing Uddhava’s highly intellectual nature, has repeatedly recommended to him that one should achieve perfection by cultivation of transcendental knowledge. But the Lord has also clearly demonstrated that such knowledge must bring one to the point of loving devotional service to Him, for otherwise it is useless. In this verse Śrī Uddhava corroborates Lord Kṛṣṇa’s statements that actual happiness is obtained by surrendering to His lotus feet. When the incarnation of Godhead Pṛthu Mahārāja was crowned, the demigod Vāyu presented him with an umbrella that constantly sprayed fine particles of water. The Lord’s two lotus feet are similarly compared here to a wonderful umbrella that produces a constant shower of delicious nectar, the bliss of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Normally, speculative analytic knowledge terminates in an impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth, but the so-called bliss of merging into impersonal spiritual existence can never be compared to the bliss of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as stated here by Śrī Uddhava. Kṛṣṇa consciousness thus automatically constitutes perfect knowledge, since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. The words *abhihatasya* and *abhivarṣāt* are significant in this verse. *Abhihatasya* indicates one who is being defeated on all sides by the onslaught of material nature, whereas *abhivarṣāt* indicates a downpour of nectar that eliminates all of the problems of material existence. By our intelligence we should look beyond the dull material body and nonsensical material mind to observe the unlimited shower of blissful nectar coming from the two lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Then our real good fortune will begin.

### Translation

**O almighty Lord, please be merciful and uplift this hopeless living entity who has fallen into the dark hole of material existence, where the snake of time has bitten him. In spite of such abominable conditions, this poor living entity has tremendous desire to relish the most insignificant material happiness. Please save me, my Lord, by pouring down the nectar of Your instructions, which awaken one to spiritual freedom.**

### Purport

Material life, so much cherished by the nondevotees, is here compared to a dark hole filled with poisonous snakes. In material life there is certainly no clear understanding of one’s ultimate identity, of God or of the universe. Everything is vague and dark. In material life the poisonous snake of time is always threatening, and at any moment our near and dear ones will be killed by the mortal fangs of the serpent. Ultimately, we ourselves will also be bitten and killed by the poisonous effects of time. The word *sampatitam* indicates that the falldown of the living entity is complete. In other words, he cannot get up again. Śrī Uddhava therefore appeals to the Lord to be kind to these poor fallen souls, humbly represented by his own self. If one receives the Lord’s mercy, then even without any further qualification one can go back home, back to Godhead; and without the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the most learned, austere, powerful, wealthy or beautiful man will be pathetically crushed by the material world’s machinery of illusion. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, as described here, is *mahānubhāva,* or the greatest, most powerful and most merciful personality, whose influence extends everywhere. The Lord’s mercy is manifest in the form of His nectarean instructions such as *Bhagavad-gītā* and the *Uddhava-gītā,* being spoken here. The word *kṣudra-sukhoru-tarṣam* reveals the irony of material existence. Although material happiness is *kṣudra,* or ridiculous and insignificant, our desire to enjoy it is *uru,* tremendous. Our disproportionate hankering to enjoy dead matter is certainly an illusory state of mind, and it gives us constant distress, keeping us bound up in the dark hole of material existence. Every living entity should put aside his false prestige based on ephemeral bodily qualifications and appeal sincerely to the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, for His mercy. The Lord hears every sincere appeal, from even the most fallen soul, and the effects of the Lord’s mercy are wonderful. Although *jñānīs, yogīs* and fruitive workers are laboriously endeavoring to achieve their respective goals, their position is precarious and uncertain. Simply by achieving the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, one can very easily attain the highest perfection of life. If even one who is not a great or pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa sincerely appeals to the Lord for His mercy, the Lord is sure to give it generously.

*navaikādaśa pañca trīn  
bhāvān bhūteṣu yena vai

taj jñānaṁ mama niścitam*

### Synonyms

*nava* — nine; *ekādaśa* — eleven; *pañca* — five; *trīn* — and three; *bhāvān* — elements; *bhūteṣu* — in all living beings (from Lord Brahmā down to the immovable living entities); *yena* — by which knowledge; *vai* — certainly; *īkṣeta* — one may see; *atha* — thus; *ekam* — one element; *api* — indeed; *eṣu* — within these twenty-eight elements; *tat* — that; *jñānam* — knowledge; *mama* — by Me; *niścitam* — is authorized.

### Translation

**I personally approve of that knowledge by which one sees the combination of nine, eleven, five and three elements in all living entities, and ultimately one element within those twenty-eight.**

### Purport

The nine elements are material nature, the living entity, the *mahat-tattva,* false ego, and the five objects of sense perception, namely sound, touch, form, taste and aroma. The eleven elements are the five working senses (the voice, hands, legs, anus and genitals) plus the five knowledge-acquiring senses (the ears, touch, eyes, tongue and nostrils), along with the coordinative sense, the mind. The five elements are the five physical elements, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, and the three elements are the three modes of material nature — goodness, passion and ignorance. All living entities, from mighty Lord Brahmā down to an insignificant weed, manifest material bodies composed of these twenty-eight elements. The one element within all twenty-eight is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, who is all-pervading within the material and spiritual worlds.

One can easily understand that the material universe is composed of innumerable causes and effects. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes, all secondary causes and their effects are ultimately nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. This understanding constitutes real knowledge, or *jñāna,* which is essential for perfecting one’s life.

*etad eva hi vijñānaṁ

### Synonyms

*etat* — this; *eva* — indeed; *hi* — actually; *vijñānam* — realized knowledge; *na* — not; *tathā* — in that way; *ekena* — by the one (Personality of Godhead); *yena* — by whom; *yat* — which (universe); *sthiti* — maintenance; *utpatti* — creation; *apyayān* — and annihilation; *paśyet* — one should see; *bhāvānām* — of all material elements; *tri*-*guṇa* — of the three modes of nature; *ātmanām* — composed.

### Translation

**When one no longer sees the twenty-eight separated material elements, which arise from a single cause, but rather sees the cause itself, the Personality of Godhead — at that time one’s direct experience is called vijñāna, or self-realization.**

### Purport

The difference between *jñāna* (ordinary Vedic knowledge) and *vijñāna* (self-realization) can be understood as follows. A conditioned soul, although cultivating Vedic knowledge, continues to identify himself to some extent with the material body and mind and consequently with the material universe. In trying to understand the world he lives in, the conditioned soul learns through Vedic knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the one supreme cause of all material manifestations. He comes to understand the world around him, which he accepts more or less as his world. As he progresses in spiritual realization, breaking through the barrier of bodily identification, and realizes the existence of the eternal soul, he gradually identifies himself as part and parcel of the spiritual world, Vaikuṇṭha. At that time he is no longer interested in the Personality of Godhead merely as the supreme explanation of the material world; rather, he begins to reorient his entire mode of consciousness so that the central object of his attention is the Personality of Godhead. Such a reorientation is required, since the Supreme Lord is the factual center and cause of everything. A self-realized soul in the stage of *vijñāna* thus experiences the Personality of Godhead not merely as the creator of the material world but as the supreme living entity existing blissfully in His own eternal context. As one progresses in one’s realization of the Supreme Lord in His own abode in the spiritual sky, one gradually becomes disinterested in the material universe and ceases to define the Supreme Lord in terms of His temporary manifestations. A self-realized soul in the stage of *vijñāna* is not at all attracted by objects that are created, maintained and ultimately destroyed. The stage of *jñāna* is the preliminary stage of knowledge for those still identifying themselves in terms of the material universe, whereas *vijñāna* is the mature stage of knowledge for those who see themselves as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.

### Verse text

*ādāv ante ca madhye ca  
sṛjyāt sṛjyaṁ yad anviyāt  
punas tat-pratisaṅkrāme  
yac chiṣyeta tad eva sat*

### Synonyms

*ādau* — in the causal stage; *ante* — in the termination of the causal function; *ca* — also; *madhye* — in the phase of maintenance; *ca* — also; *sṛjyāt* — from one production; *sṛjyam* — to another production; *yat* — which; *anviyāt* — accompanies; *punaḥ* — again; *tat* — of all material phases; *pratisaṅkrāme* — in the annihilation; *yat* — which; *śiṣyeta* — remains; *tat* — that; *eva* — indeed; *sat* — the one eternal.

### Translation

**Commencement, termination and maintenance are the stages of material causation. That which consistently accompanies all these material phases from one creation to another and remains alone when all material phases are annihilated is the one eternal.**

### Purport

The Lord here reiterates that the one Supreme Personality of Godhead is the basis of unlimited material variety. Material activity is a chain of cause-and-effect relationships by which innumerable objects are produced. A particular material effect is converted into a subsequent cause, and when the causal phase is terminated, the effect disappears. Fire causes firewood to burn to ashes, and when the causal function of fire is finished, fire itself, which was the effect of a previous cause, is also terminated. The simple fact is that all material objects are created, maintained and ultimately annihilated by the supreme potency of the Lord. And when the entire field of material cause and effect is withdrawn, so that all cause-effect relationships vanish, the Personality of Godhead remains in His own abode. Therefore, although innumerable objects may function as causes, they are not the ultimate or supreme cause. Only the Personality of Godhead is the absolute cause. Similarly, although material things may exist, they do not always exist. The Personality of Godhead alone has absolute existence. By the process of *jñāna,* or knowledge, one should understand the supreme position of the Lord.

### Verse text

*śrutiḥ pratyakṣam aitihyam  
anumānaṁ catuṣṭayam  
pramāṇeṣv anavasthānād  
vikalpāt sa virajyate*

### Synonyms

*śrutiḥ* — Vedic knowledge; *pratyakṣam* — direct experience; *aitihyam* — traditional wisdom; *anumānam* — logical induction; *catuṣṭayam* — fourfold; *pramāneṣu* — among all types of evidence; *anavasthānāt* — due to the flickering nature; *vikalpāt* — from material diversity; *saḥ* — a person; *virajyate* — becomes detached.

### Translation

**From the four types of evidence — Vedic knowledge, direct experience, traditional wisdom and logical induction — one can understand the temporary, insubstantial situation of the material world, by which one becomes detached from the duality of this world.**

### Purport

In the *śruti,* or Vedic literature, it is clearly stated that everything emanates from the Absolute Truth, is maintained by the Absolute Truth and at the end is conserved within the Absolute Truth. Similarly, by direct experience we can observe the creation and destruction of great empires, cities, buildings, bodies and so on. Furthermore, we find all around the world traditional wisdom warning people that things in this world cannot last. Finally, by logical induction we can easily conclude that nothing in this world is permanent. Material sense gratification — up to the highest possible living standard found in the heavenly planets or down to the lowest conditions in the most repugnant precincts of hell — is always unsteady and prone to collapse at any moment. One should therefore develop *vairāgya,* detachment, as stated here.

Another meaning of this verse is that the four types of evidence cited here are often mutually contradictory in their description of the highest truth. One should therefore be detached from the duality of mundane evidence, including the portions of the *Vedas* that deal with the material world. Instead, one should accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the actual authority. Both in *Bhagavad-gītā* and here in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* Lord Kṛṣṇa is personally speaking, and thus there is no need to enter into the bewildering network of competing systems of mundane logic. One can directly hear from the Absolute Truth Himself and immediately acquire perfect knowledge. One thereby becomes detached from inferior systems of knowledge, which cause one to hover on the material mental platform.

*karmaṇāṁ pariṇāmitvād  
ā-viriñcyād amaṅgalam  
vipaścin naśvaraṁ paśyed  
adṛṣṭam api dṛṣṭa-vat*

### Synonyms

*karmaṇām* — of material activities; *pariṇāmitvāt* — because of being subject to transformation; *ā* — up to; *viriñcyāt* — the planet of Lord Brahmā; *amaṅgalam* — inauspicious unhappiness; *vipaścit* — an intelligent person; *naśvaram* — as temporary; *paśyet* — should see; *adṛṣṭam* — that which he has not yet experienced; *api* — indeed; *dṛṣṭa*-*vat* — just like that already experienced.

### Translation

**An intelligent person should see that any material activity is subject to constant transformation and that even on the planet of Lord Brahmā there is thus simply unhappiness. Indeed, a wise man can understand that just as all that he has seen is temporary, similarly, all things within the universe have a beginning and an end.**

### Purport

The word *adṛṣṭam* indicates the heavenly standard of life available in the higher planets within this universe. Such celestial neighborhoods are not actually experienced on the earth planet, although they are described in the Vedic literatures. One may argue that promotion to material heaven is recommended in the *karma-kāṇḍa* portion of the *Vedas* and that although the happiness available there is not eternal, at least for some time one may enjoy life. Lord Kṛṣṇa here states, however, that even on the planet of Lord Brahmā, which is superior to the heavenly planets, there is no happiness whatsoever. Even in the upper planetary systems there is rivalry, envy, irritation, lamentation and ultimately death itself.

### Synonyms

*bhakti*-*yogaḥ* — devotional service to the Lord; *purā* — previously; *eva* — indeed; *uktaḥ* — explained; *prīyamāṇāya* — who has developed love; *te* — unto you; *anagha* — O sinless Uddhava; *punaḥ* — again; *ca* — also; *kathayiṣyāmi* — I will explain; *mat* — unto Me; *bhakteḥ* — of devotional service; *kāraṇam* — the actual means; *param* — supreme.

### Translation

**O sinless Uddhava, because you love Me, I previously explained to you the process of devotional service. Now I will again explain the supreme process for achieving loving service unto Me.**

### Purport

Although Lord Kṛṣṇa previously described *bhakti-yoga* to Śrī Uddhava, Uddhava is not yet satisfied, because he loves Lord Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who loves the Lord cannot be fully satiated by discussions of devotional service mixed with descriptions of mere Vedic duties and analytic philosophy. The supreme stage of conscious existence is pure love of Kṛṣṇa, and one who is addicted to Lord Kṛṣṇa desires to constantly drink the nectar of such topics. Lord Kṛṣṇa has given an extensive survey of many aspects of human civilization, including the *varṇāśrama-dharma* system and the processes of distinguishing between matter and spirit, renouncing sense gratification, and so forth. Now Uddhava is hankering to hear specifically about pure devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, and the Lord thus turns to that topic.

### Translation

**Firm faith in the blissful narrations of My pastimes, constant chanting of My glories, unwavering attachment to ceremonial worship of Me, praising Me through beautiful hymns, great respect for My devotional service, offering obeisances with the entire body, performing first-class worship of My devotees, consciousness of Me in all living entities, offering of ordinary, bodily activities in My devotional service, use of words to describe My qualities, offering the mind to Me, rejection of all material desires, giving up wealth for My devotional service, renouncing material sense gratification and happiness, and performing all desirable activities such as charity, sacrifice, chanting, vows and austerities with the purpose of achieving Me — these constitute actual religious principles, by which those human beings who have actually surrendered themselves to Me automatically develop love for Me. What other purpose or goal could remain for My devotee?**

### Purport

The words *mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā* are significant in this verse. *Abhyadhikā* indicates “superior quality.” The Lord is extremely satisfied with those who offer worship to His pure devotees, and He rewards them accordingly. Because of the Lord’s generous appraisal of His pure devotees, worship of the pure devotees is described as superior to worship of the Lord Himself. The words *mad-artheṣv aṅga-ceṣṭā* state that ordinary, bodily activities such as brushing the teeth, taking bath, eating, etc., should all be offered to the Supreme Lord as devotional service. The words *vacasā mad-guṇeraṇam* indicate that whether one speaks in ordinary, crude language or with learned poetic eloquence, one should describe the glories of the Personality of Godhead. The words *mad-arthe ’rtha-parityāgaḥ* indicate that one should spend one’s money for festivals glorifying the Personality of Godhead, such as Ratha-yātrā, Janmāṣṭamī and Gaura-pūrṇimā. Also, one is herein instructed to spend money to assist the mission of one’s spiritual master and other Vaiṣṇavas. Wealth that cannot be used properly in the Lord’s service and is thus an impediment to one’s clear consciousness should be given up entirely. The word *bhogasya* refers to sense gratification, headed by sex enjoyment, and *sukhasya* refers to sentimental material happiness, such as excessive family attachment. The words *dattaṁ hutam* indicate that one should offer to *brāhmaṇas* and Vaiṣṇavas first-class foods cooked in ghee. One should offer the vibration *svāhā* to Lord Viṣṇu in an authorized sacrificial fire along with grains and ghee. The word *japtam* indicates that one should constantly chant the holy names of the Lord.

### Translation

**When one’s peaceful consciousness, strengthened by the mode of goodness, is fixed on the Personality of Godhead, one achieves religiosity, knowledge, detachment and opulence.**

### Purport

A pure devotee becomes peaceful, *śānta,* by desiring everything for the service of the Lord and nothing for himself. He is strengthened by the transcendental, or purified, mode of goodness and thus achieves the supreme religious principle of directly serving the Lord. He also achieves *jñāna,* or knowledge of the Lord’s form and his own spiritual body, detachment from material piety and sin, and the opulences of the spiritual world. One who is not a pure devotee of the Lord, however, but whose devotion is mixed with a fascination for mystic knowledge, is strengthened by the material mode of goodness. Through his meditation on the Lord he achieves the lesser results of *dharma* (piety in the mode of goodness), *jñāna* (knowledge of spirit and matter) and *vairāgya* (detachment from the lower modes of nature). Ultimately, one should be a pure devotee of the Lord, since even the best the material world has to offer is most insignificant compared to the kingdom of God.

*yat* — when; *arpitam* — fixed; *tat* — this (consciousness); *vikalpe* — in material variety (the body, home, family, etc.); *indriyaiḥ* — with the senses; *paridhāvati* — chasing all around; *rajaḥ*-*valam* — strengthened by the mode of passion; *ca* — also; *asat* — to that which has no permanent reality; *niṣṭham* — dedicated; *cittam* — consciousness; *viddhi* — you should understand; *viparyayam* — the opposite (of what was previously mentioned).

### Translation

**When consciousness is fixed on the material body, home and other, similar objects of sense gratification, one spends one’s life chasing after material objects with the help of the senses. Consciousness, thus powerfully affected by the mode of passion, becomes dedicated to impermanent things, and in this way irreligion, ignorance, attachment and wretchedness arise.**

### Purport

In the previous verse Lord Kṛṣṇa explained the auspicious results of fixing the mind in Him, and now the opposite is explained. *Rajas-valam* indicates that one’s passion grows so strong that one commits sinful activities and reaps all types of misfortune. Although materialistic people are blind to their impending wretchedness, one can confirm by all types of evidence — namely Vedic injunctions, direct observation, traditional wisdom and inductive logic — that the result of violating the laws of God is disastrous.

### Translation

**Actual religious principles are stated to be those that lead one to My devotional service. Real knowledge is the awareness that reveals My all-pervading presence. Detachment is complete disinterest in the objects of material sense gratification, and opulence is the eight mystic perfections, such as aṇimā-siddhi.**

### Purport

The Supreme Lord is perfect knowledge; thus one who has been delivered from ignorance automatically engages in the devotional service of the Lord and is called religious. One who becomes detached from the three modes of material nature and the gratificatory objects they produce is considered to be situated in detachment. The eight mystic *yoga* perfections, described previously by the Lord to Uddhava, constitute material power, or opulence, in the highest degree.

### Translation

**Absorbing the intelligence in Me constitutes mental equilibrium, and complete discipline of the senses is self-control. Tolerance means patiently enduring unhappiness, and steadfastness occurs when one conquers the tongue and genitals. The greatest charity is to give up all aggression toward others, and renunciation of lust is understood to be real austerity. Real heroism is to conquer one’s natural tendency to enjoy material life, and reality is seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere. Truthfulness means to speak the truth in a pleasing way, as declared by great sages. Cleanliness is detachment in fruitive activities, whereas renunciation is the sannyāsa order of life. The true desirable wealth for human beings is religiousness, and I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, am sacrifice. Religious remuneration is devotion to the ācārya with the purpose of acquiring spiritual instruction, and the greatest strength is the prāṇāyāma system of breath control.**

### Purport

Lord Kṛṣṇa here describes those qualities that are desirable for persons advancing in human life. *Śama,* or “mental equilibrium,” means to fix the intelligence in Lord Kṛṣṇa. Mere peacefulness without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a dull and useless state of mind. *Dama,* or “discipline,” means first to control one’s own senses. If one wants to discipline one’s children, disciples or followers without controlling one’s own senses, one becomes a mere laughingstock. Tolerance means to patiently endure unhappiness, such as that provoked by the insults or negligence of others. One must also sometimes accept material inconvenience to carry out the injunctions of scriptures, and that unhappiness must also be patiently endured. If one is not tolerant of the insults and abuse of others, nor tolerant of the inconveniences that may arise from following authorized religious scriptures, it is simply foolishness for him to make a whimsical show of tolerating extreme heat, cold and pain and so on, just to impress others. Concerning steadfastness, if one does not control the tongue and genitals, then any other steadfastness is useless. Real charity means to renounce all aggression toward others. If one gives money to charitable causes but at the same time engages in exploitative business enterprises or abusive political tactics, one’s charity is worth nothing at all. Austerity means to give up lust and sense gratification and to observe prescribed vows such as Ekādaśī; it does not mean inventing whimsical methods of torturing the material body. Real heroism is to conquer one’s lower nature. Certainly everyone likes to propagate his own fame as a brilliant person, but everyone is also subject to lust, anger, greed and so forth. Therefore, if one can conquer these lower characteristics generated from the modes of passion and ignorance, one is a greater hero than those who merely destroy their political opponents through intrigue and violence.

One can develop equal vision by giving up jealousy and envy and by recognizing the existence of the soul within every material body. This attitude pleases the Supreme Lord, who then reveals Himself, solidifying forever one’s equal vision. Merely describing things that exist does not constitute the last word in the perception of reality. One must also see the true spiritual equality of all living entities and all situations. Truthfulness means that one should speak in a pleasing way so that there will be a beneficial effect. If one becomes attached to pointing out the faults of others in the name of truth, then such faultfinding will not be appreciated by saintly persons. The bona fide spiritual master speaks the truth in such a way that people can elevate themselves to the spiritual platform, and one should learn this art of truthfulness. If one is attached to material things, his body and mind are understood to be always polluted. Cleanliness therefore means to give up material attachment, not merely to frequently rinse one’s skin with water. Real renunciation is giving up one’s false sense of proprietorship over one’s relatives and wife, and not just giving away material objects, while real wealth is to be religious. Sacrifice is the Personality of Godhead Himself, because the performer of sacrifice, to be successful, must absorb his consciousness in the Personality of Godhead and not in temporary, material rewards that may accrue from sacrifice. Real religious remuneration means that one should serve saintly persons who can enlighten one with spiritual knowledge. One may offer remuneration to his spiritual master, who has enlightened him, by distributing the same knowledge to others, thereby pleasing the *ācārya.* Preaching work thus constitutes the highest form of remuneration. By performing the *prāṇāyāma* system of respiratory control, one can easily subdue the mind, and one who can in this way perfectly control the restless mind is the most powerful person.

### Translation

**Actual opulence is My own nature as the Personality of Godhead, through which I exhibit the six unlimited opulences. The supreme gain in life is devotional service to Me, and actual education is nullifying the false perception of duality within the soul. Real modesty is to be disgusted with improper activities, and beauty is to possess good qualities such as detachment. Real happiness is to transcend material happiness and unhappiness, and real misery is to be implicated in searching for sex pleasure. A wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from bondage, and a fool is one who identifies with his material body and mind. The real path in life is that which leads to Me, and the wrong path is sense gratification, by which consciousness is bewildered. Actual heaven is the predominance of the mode of goodness, whereas hell is the predominance of ignorance. I am everyone’s true friend, acting as the spiritual master of the entire universe, and one’s home is the human body. My dear friend Uddhava, one who is enriched with good qualities is actually said to be rich, and one who is unsatisfied in life is actually poor. A wretched person is one who cannot control his senses, whereas one who is not attached to sense gratification is a real controller. One who attaches himself to sense gratification is the opposite, a slave. Thus, Uddhava, I have elucidated all of the matters about which you inquired. There is no need for a more elaborate description of these good and bad qualities, since to constantly see good and bad is itself a bad quality. The best quality is to transcend material good and evil.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally full of six opulences, namely unlimited beauty, wealth, fame, knowledge, strength and renunciation. Therefore the greatest profit in life is to achieve personal loving service to the Lord, who is naturally the reservoir of all pleasure. Real education means to give up the false idea that anything is separate from the Lord, the source of all potencies. Similarly, one should not falsely consider the individual soul to be different or separate from the Supreme Soul. Mere bashfulness does not constitute modesty. One should spontaneously withdraw in disgust from sinful activities; then one is actually modest or humble. One who is satisfied in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus does not seek material pleasure or suffer material unhappiness is considered to be actually situated in happiness. The most wretched person is one addicted to sex pleasure, and a wise man is one who knows the process of freedom from such material bondage. A fool is one who gives up his eternal friendship with Lord Kṛṣṇa and instead identifies himself with his own temporary material body, mind, society, community and family. The real path in life is not simply a modern interstate highway or, in more simple cultures, a footpath free of thorns and mud. It is that path that leads to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The wrong path in life is not simply a road having many thieves or tollbooths; it is that path that leads one to utter confusion in material sense gratification. A heavenly situation is that in which the mode of goodness predominates, rather than that found on the planet of Indra, where passion and ignorance sometimes disturb the celestial atmosphere. Hell is anywhere the mode of ignorance is predominant, and not merely the hellish planets, where, according to Lord Śiva, a pure devotee can think of Kṛṣṇa and remain happy. Our actual friend in life is the bona fide spiritual master, who saves us from all dangers. Among all *gurus,* Lord Kṛṣṇa is Himself the *jagad-guru,* or spiritual master of the entire universe. In material life our own material body is our immediate home, rather than some structure of bricks, cement, stone and wood. A rich man is one who possesses innumerable good qualities; he is not a neurotic fool with a large bank account. A poor man is one who is unsatisfied, which is self-explanatory. One who cannot control his senses is certainly wretched and miserable in life, whereas one who detaches himself from material life is actually a lord or controller. In modern times there are remnants of aristocracy in Europe and other countries, but such so-called lords often display the habits of lower forms of life. A real lord is one who conquers material existence by rising to the spiritual platform. A person who is attached to material life will undoubtedly manifest the opposites of all the good qualities mentioned here, and he is thus the symbol of going backward in life. The Lord concludes His analysis by stating that there is no need for further elaboration of these good and bad qualities. Indeed, the purpose of life is to transcend materially good and bad qualities and come to the liberated platform of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This point will be further explained in the following chapter.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Perfection of Spiritual Knowledge.”*
