CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT

This chapter briefly summarizes the process of *jñāna-yoga,* which previous chapters described in detail.

Every created thing in this universe is a material product of the three modes of nature, is subject to sensory perception, and is essentially unreal. Actually, the designations of “good” and “bad” that we assign to the various objects and activities of this world are all superficial. It is better to avoid condemning or praising anything of this world, because doing so simply entangles one in matter and deprives one of the higher goals of spiritual life. Hidden within every object of the material universe is the spirit soul, who underlies both the causes and products of manifest existence. One should see things in this light and thus move about the material world in a mood of detachment.

As long as there is a relationship between the bodily senses, which are comprised of matter, and the soul, which is the reality, one will continue in false consciousness. Although material existence is unreal, those who lack discrimination remain entangled in the cycle of birth and death because of their absorption in sense gratification. All the phases of material life — such as birth, death, sorrow and happiness — belong not to the soul but to the materialistic false ego. By learning to distinguish between the soul and its opposite, matter, one can destroy this false identification.

There is a single Absolute Truth present at the beginning and at the end of this world. During its interim, or maintenance phase, the cosmic manifestation is also founded upon the same Absolute Truth. This Absolute, Brahman, exists everywhere, both positively by its manifestations and negatively by its aloofness. Brahman is unique in being self-sufficient, whereas this world is the expansion of Brahman produced through the material mode of passion.

By the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, one can understand the Absolute Truth and come to appreciate the nonspiritual nature of the material body and its extensions. Desisting from engagement in material sense enjoyment, one then becomes satisfied in the ecstasy of the self. Just as the sun remains untouched by the coming and going of clouds, the discriminating, liberated person remains unaffected by the activities of his senses. Nevertheless, until one becomes perfectly fixed in *bhakti-yoga,* pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, one should carefully avoid contacting material sense objects. An aspiring devotee may meet various obstacles and fall down, but in his next life he will continue his practice by dint of what he has already accomplished in devotional service. He will never again become bound up by the laws of *karma.* The man who is liberated and established in discrimination will under no circumstances seek false enjoyment by indulging in material sense gratification. He knows that the soul is changeless and that any contrary conception imposed on the pure self is sheer illusion.

If, during the immature stage of spiritual practice, one suffers physical disease or other disturbances, the *Vedas* enjoin that he should certainly take proper measures to eradicate the problem. The prescribed remedies for lust and the other enemies of the mind are meditation on the Supreme Lord and *saṅkīrtana,* the loud chanting of His names. The remedy for the disease of false ego is rendering service to the Supreme Lord’s saintly devotees.

By practicing *yoga,* some nondevotees keep their bodies youthful and fit, and may even achieve mystic perfections or long life. But these attainments are actually worthless, because they are perfections only of the material body. An intelligent person is therefore uninterested in this kind of process. Rather, by taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, an aspiring devotee who is seriously dedicated to the Lord rids himself of all disturbances and becomes empowered to attain the highest perfection, the full bliss of spiritual life.

श्रीभगवानुवाच  
परस्वभावकर्माणि न प्रशंसेन्न गर्हयेत् ।  
विश्वमेकात्मकं पश्यन् प्रकृत्या पुरुषेण च ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

śrī-bhagavān uvāca  
*para-svabhāva-karmāṇi  
na praśaṁsen na garhayet  
viśvam ekātmakaṁ paśyan  
prakṛtyā puruṣeṇa ca*

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *para* — anyone else’s; *svabhāva* — nature; *karmāṇi* — and activities; *na* *praśaṁset* — one should not praise; *na* *garhayet* — one should not criticize; *viśvam* — the world; *eka*-*ātmakam* — based on one reality; *paśyan* — seeing; *prakṛtyā* — along with nature; *puruṣeṇa* — with the enjoying soul; *ca* — also.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: One should neither praise nor criticize the conditioned nature and activities of other persons. Rather, one should see this world as simply the combination of material nature and the enjoying souls, all based on the one Absolute Truth.**

### Purport

Material situations and activities appear to be good, passionate or ignorant according to the interaction of the modes of nature. These modes are produced by the illusory potency of the Lord, which is itself not different from its master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So a devotee of the Lord remains aloof from the illusory, temporary manifestations of material nature. At the same time, he accepts material nature as the potency of the Lord and thus essentially real. The example may be given that modeling clay is shaped by a child into various playful forms such as tigers, men or houses. The modeling clay is real, whereas the temporary shapes it assumes are illusory, not being actual tigers, men or houses. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation is modeling clay in the hands of the Supreme Lord, who acts through *māyā* to shape the glaring temporary forms of illusion, which absorb the minds of those who are not devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

परस्वभावकर्माणि य- प्रशंसति निन्दति ।  
स आशु भ्रश्यते स्वार्थादसत्यभिनिवेशत- ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*para-svabhāva-karmāṇi  
yaḥ praśaṁsati nindati  
sa āśu bhraśyate svārthād  
asaty abhiniveśataḥ*

### Synonyms

*para* — another’s; *svabhāva* — personality; *karmāṇi* — and work; *yaḥ* — who; *praśaṁsati* — praises; *nindati* — criticizes; *saḥ* — he; *āśu* — quickly; *bhraśyate* — falls down; *sva*-*arthāt* — from his own interest; *asati* — in unreality; *abhiniveśataḥ* — because of becoming entangled.

### Translation

**Whoever indulges in praising or criticizing the qualities and behavior of others will quickly become deviated from his own best interest by his entanglement in illusory dualities.**

### Purport

A conditioned soul desires to lord it over material nature and thus criticizes another conditioned soul whom he considers inferior. Similarly, one praises a superior materialist because one aspires to that superior position, in which one may dominate others. Praising and criticizing other materialistic people are thus directly or indirectly based on envy of other living entities and cause one to fall down from *sva-artha,* one’s real self-interest, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The words *asaty abhiniveśataḥ,* “by absorption in the temporary, or unreal,” indicate that one should not adopt a concept of material duality and praise or criticize other materialistic persons. Rather, one should praise the pure devotees of the Supreme Lord and criticize the mentality of rebellion against the Personality of Godhead, by which one becomes a nondevotee. One should not criticize a low-class materialist, thinking that a high-class materialist is nice. In other words, one should distinguish between the material and the spiritual and should not become absorbed in good and bad on the material platform. For example, an honest citizen distinguishes between the life of civil freedom and that of imprisonment, whereas a foolish prisoner distinguishes between comfortable and uncomfortable prison cells. Just as for a free citizen any situation in prison is unacceptable, for a liberated, Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee any material position is unappealing.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura indicates that rather than trying to separate conditioned souls by materialistic distinctions, one should bring them together to chant the holy names of the Lord and propagate the *saṅkīrtana* movement of Lord Caitanya. A nondevotee, or even an envious third-class devotee, is not interested in uniting people on the platform of love of Godhead. Instead he unnecessarily separates them by emphasizing material distinctions like “communist,” “capitalist,” “black,” “white,” “rich,” “poor,” “liberal,” “conservative” and so on. Material life is always imperfect, full of ignorance and disappointing in the end. Rather than praising and criticizing the high and low features of ignorance, one should be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, on the spiritual platform of eternity, bliss and knowledge.

तैजसे निद्रयापन्ने पिण्डस्थो नष्टचेतन- ।  
मायां प्राप्नोति मृत्युं वा तद्वन्नानार्थद‍ृक् पुमान् ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*taijase nidrayāpanne  
piṇḍa-stho naṣṭa-cetanaḥ  
māyāṁ prāpnoti mṛtyuṁ vā  
tadvan nānārtha-dṛk pumān*

### Synonyms

*taijase* — when the senses, which are the products of false ego in the mode of passion; *nidrayā* — by sleep; *āpanne* — are overcome; *piṇḍa* — in the shell of the material body; *sthaḥ* — (the soul) who is situated; *naṣṭa*-*cetanaḥ* — having lost his consciousness; *māyām* — the illusion of dreaming; *prāpnoti* — he experiences; *mṛtyum* — the deathlike condition of deep sleep; *vā* — or; *tadvat* — in the same way; *nānā*-*artha* — in terms of material varieties; *dṛk* — who sees; *pumān* — a person.

### Translation

**Just as the embodied spirit soul loses external consciousness when his senses are overcome by the illusion of dreaming or the deathlike state of deep sleep, so a person experiencing material duality must encounter illusion and death.**

### Purport

The material senses are described here as *taijasa* because they are born of false ego in the mode of passion. Impelled by false ego, one dreams of the material world without the Personality of Godhead and makes plans to lord it over nature, to exploit her resources. Modern atheistic scientists have developed this false ego to a fine art and imagine themselves great heroes conquering the obstacles of nature and moving forward toward inevitable omniscience. Such dreamy materialists are repeatedly stunned by the crushing reactions of the laws of nature, and their arrogant, agnostic civilizations are repeatedly annihilated by world wars, natural disasters and violent shifts of the cosmic situation.

On a simpler level, all conditioned souls are captivated by sex attraction and thus bound to the illusion of material society, friendship and love. They imagine themselves to be wonderful enjoyers of the material nature, which suddenly turns against them and kills them just like the “tamed” animal that suddenly turns on its master and kills him.

किं भद्रं किमभद्रं वा द्वैतस्यावस्तुन- कियत् ।  
वाचोदितं तदनृतं मनसा ध्यातमेव च ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*kiṁ bhadraṁ kim abhadraṁ vā  
dvaitasyāvastunaḥ kiyat  
vācoditaṁ tad anṛtaṁ  
manasā dhyātam eva ca*

### Synonyms

*kim* — what; *bhadram* — good; *kim* — what; *abhadram* — bad; *vā* — or; *dvaitasya* — of this duality; *avastunaḥ* — insubstantial; *kiyat* — how much; *vācā* — by words; *uditam* — generated; *tat* — that; *anṛtam* — false; *manasā* — by the mind; *dhyātam* — meditated upon; *eva* — indeed; *ca* — and.

### Translation

**That which is expressed by material words or meditated upon by the material mind is not ultimate truth. What, therefore, is actually good or bad within this insubstantial world of duality, and how can the extent of such good and bad be measured?**

### Purport

The actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom everything emanates, by whom everything is maintained, and in whom everything merges to rest. Material nature is the reflection of the Absolute Truth, and by the interaction of the material modes of nature the innumerable varieties of matter appear to be separate, independent truths. *Māyā,* illusion, distracts the conditioned soul from the Absolute Truth and absorbs his mind in the glaring manifestation of matter, which ultimately is nondifferent from the Absolute Truth, being an emanation from Him. The sense of good and bad as separate from the Supreme Lord is like the good and bad dreams experienced by a sleeping person. Good and bad dreams are equally unreal. Similarly, material good and evil have no permanent existence separate from the Personality of Godhead.

The Supreme Lord is the well-wisher of every living entity, and therefore execution of His order is good, whereas disobeying His order is bad. Lord Kṛṣṇa has created a perfect social and occupational system called *varṇāśrama-dharma,* and the Lord has further given perfect spiritual knowledge in *Bhagavad-gītā* and other literatures. Execution of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s order will bring complete social, psychological, political, economic and spiritual success to human society. We should not foolishly look for so-called good outside the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Such orders are called the laws of God and constitute the essence, or substance, of religion.

छायाप्रत्याह्वयाभासा ह्यसन्तोऽप्यर्थकारिण- ।  
एवं देहादयो भावा यच्छन्त्यामृत्युतो भयम् ॥ ५ ॥

### Verse text

*chāyā-pratyāhvayābhāsā  
hy asanto ’py artha-kāriṇaḥ  
evaṁ dehādayo bhāvā  
yacchanty ā-mṛtyuto bhayam*

### Synonyms

*chāyā* — shadows; *pratyāhvaya* — echoes; *ābhāsāḥ* — and false appearances; *hi* — indeed; *asantaḥ* — nonexistent; *api* — although; *artha* — ideas; *kāriṇaḥ* — creating; *evam* — in the same way; *deha*-*ādayaḥ* — the body and so on; *bhāvāḥ* — material conceptions; *yacchanti* — they give; *ā*-*mṛtyutaḥ* — up to the point of death; *bhayam* — fear.

### Translation

**Although shadows, echoes and mirages are only illusory reflections of real things, such reflections do cause a semblance of meaningful or comprehensible perception. In the same way, although the identification of the conditioned soul with the material body, mind and ego is illusory, this identification generates fear within him even up to the moment of death.**

### Purport

Although shadows, echoes and mirages are mere reflections of real substances, they create strong emotions in persons falsely accepting them as real. In the same manner, a conditioned soul is seized by such emotions as fear, lust, anger and hope because of his illusory perception of himself as the material body, mind and false ego. By practical example it is thus shown that even illusory objects may cause highly emotional reactions. Ultimately our emotions should be absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternal truth. Fear is forever vanquished when one takes shelter of the Lord’s lotus feet. One can then enjoy the pure emotions of liberated life.

### Synonyms

*ātmā* — the Supreme Soul; *eva* — alone; *tat* *idam* — this; *viśvam* — universe; *sṛjyate* — is created; *sṛjati* — and creates; *prabhuḥ* — the Supreme Lord; *trāyate* — is protected; *trāti* — protects; *viśva*-*ātmā* — the Soul of all that be; *hriyate* — is withdrawn; *harati* — withdraws; *īśvaraḥ* — the supreme controller; *tasmāt* — than Him; *na* — no; *hi* — indeed; *ātmanaḥ* — than the Soul; *anyasmāt* — who is distinct; *anyaḥ* — other; *bhāvaḥ* — entity; *nirūpitaḥ* — is ascertained; *nirūpite* — thus established; *ayam* — this; *tri*-*vidhā* — threefold; *nirmūlā* — without basis; *bhātiḥ* — appearance; *ātmani* — within the Supersoul; *idam* — this; *guṇa*-*mayam* — consisting of the modes of nature; *viddhi* — you should know; *tri*-*vidham* — threefold; *māyayā* — by the illusory energy; *kṛtam* — created.

### Translation

**The Supersoul alone is the ultimate controller and creator of this world, and thus He alone is also the created. Similarly, the Soul of all existence Himself both maintains and is maintained, withdraws and is withdrawn. No other entity can be properly ascertained as separate from Him, the Supreme Soul, who nonetheless is distinct from everything and everyone else. The appearance of the threefold material nature, which is perceived within Him, has no actual basis. Rather, you should understand that this material nature, composed of the three modes, is simply the product of His illusory potency.**

### Purport

The Absolute Truth, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, expands His external potency and thus creates the material cosmos. As with the sun globe and its expanded rays, the Lord and His expanded potency are simultaneously one and different. Although to conditioned souls material duality seems to be based on the modes of nature, the entire material manifestation is actually nondifferent from the Lord and is of one ultimately spiritual nature. The modes of nature create sense objects, demigods, human beings, animals, friends, enemies and so forth. But in reality, everything is simply an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Lord.

Foolishly, the conditioned soul tries to lord it over material nature, but the Lord Himself, being nondifferent from that nature, is its only true proprietor. In several places the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* has given the example of the spider spinning its web by expanding thread from its own mouth. Similarly, through His own potency the Lord manifests the material world, maintains it and eventually withdraws it within Himself. Although the Lord is the unique Supreme Personality of Godhead, above everyone and everything, He is simultaneously and inconceivably nondifferent from everything. Therefore it is the Lord Himself who is manifested when the Lord creates, it is the Lord Himself who is maintained when the Lord maintains, and it is the Lord Himself who is withdrawn at the time of annihilation.

Although the Lord is nondifferent from both His spiritual abode and His material creation, still the spiritual abode, Vaikuṇṭha, is always superior to the material manifestation. Both matter and spirit are energies of the Lord, yet the spiritual energy is molded into the eternal forms of bliss and knowledge, whereas the temporary forms of matter are symbols of ignorance and frustration for the conditioned souls who covet them. The Supreme Lord is Himself the reservoir of all pleasure and is thus dear to His devotees. The presumption that the Lord cannot give us complete pleasure is due to our misidentifying Him as a product of the material modes of nature. As a result, we pursue false happiness in the deadly embrace of *māyā* and thus deviate from our eternal loving relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa.

एतद् विद्वान् मदुदितं ज्ञानविज्ञाननैपुणम् ।

### Verse text

*etad vidvān mad-uditaṁ  
jñāna-vijñāna-naipuṇam  
na nindati na ca stauti  
loke carati sūrya-vat*

### Synonyms

*etat* — this; *vidvān* — one who knows; *mat* — by Me; *uditam* — described; *jñāna* — in knowledge; *vijñāna* — and realization; *naipuṇam* — the status of being fixed; *na* *nindati* — does not criticize; *na* *ca* — nor; *stauti* — praise; *loke* — within the world; *carati* — he wanders; *sūrya*-*vat* — just like the sun.

### Translation

**One who has properly understood the process of becoming firmly fixed in theoretical and realized knowledge, as described herein by Me, does not indulge in material criticism or praise. Like the sun, he wanders freely throughout this world.**

### Purport

Every living entity emanates from the Supreme Lord and is thus naturally full of realized knowledge. But when one becomes attached to praising or criticizing material good and bad for one’s personal sense gratification, one’s expert knowledge of the Lord becomes covered. A pure devotee should neither love nor hate any aspect of material illusion; he should rather accept whatever is favorable for serving Kṛṣṇa and reject whatever is unfavorable, following the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.

*pratyakṣeṇānumānena

### Synonyms

*pratyakṣeṇa* — by direct perception; *anumānena* — by logical deduction; *nigamena* — by the statements of scripture; *ātma*-*saṁvidā* — and by one’s own realization; *ādi*-*anta*-*vat* — having a beginning and an end; *asat* — unreal; *jñātvā* — knowing; *niḥsaṅgaḥ* — free from attachment; *vicaret* — one should move about; *iha* — in this world.

### Translation

**By direct perception, logical deduction, scriptural testimony and personal realization, one should know that this world has a beginning and an end and so is not the ultimate reality. Thus one should live in this world without attachment.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, there are two main material dualities. The first duality is that one sees material good and bad, beautiful and ugly, rich and poor, and so on. The second is that one sees the entire material world as separate from or independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first duality, that of opposites, is subject to dissolution by the influence of time, and the second duality, that of separateness, is merely a hallucination. One who is firmly convinced of the temporary, illusory nature of this world moves about freely, without attachment. Although engaging in all types of devotional service for the Lord, such a person is never entangled and remains cheerful and satisfied in spiritual consciousness.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*uddhavaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Uddhava said; *na* — there is not; *eva* — indeed; *ātmanaḥ* — of the self; *na* — nor; *dehasya* — of the body; *saṁsṛtiḥ* — material existence; *draṣṭṛ*-*dṛśyayoḥ* — of the seer or the seen; *anātma* — of that which is not spirit; *sva*-*dṛśoḥ* — or of him who has innate knowledge; *īśa* — O Lord; *kasya* — of whom; *syāt* — may be; *upalabhyate* — which is experienced.

### Translation

**Śrī Uddhava said: My dear Lord, it is not possible for this material existence to be the experience of either the soul, who is the seer, or of the body, which is the seen object. On the one hand, the spirit soul is innately endowed with perfect knowledge, and on the other hand, the material body is not a conscious, living entity. To whom, then, does this experience of material existence pertain?**

### Purport

Since the living entity is pure spirit soul, innately full of perfect knowledge and bliss, and since the material body is a biochemical machine without knowledge or personal consciousness, who or what is actually experiencing the ignorance and anxiety of this material existence? The conscious experience of material life cannot be denied, and thus Uddhava asks Lord Kṛṣṇa this question to elicit a more precise understanding of the process by which illusion occurs.

*ātmāvyayo ’guṇaḥ śuddhaḥ  
svayaṁ-jyotir anāvṛtaḥ  
agni-vad dāru-vad acid  
dehaḥ kasyeha saṁsṛtiḥ*

### Synonyms

*ātmā* — the spirit soul; *avyayaḥ* — inexhaustible; *aguṇaḥ* — transcendental to the material modes; *śuddhaḥ* — pure; *svayam*-*jyotiḥ* — self-luminous; *anāvṛtaḥ* — uncovered; *agni*-*vat* — like fire; *dāru*-*vat* — like firewood; *acit* — nonliving; *dehaḥ* — the material body; *kasya* — of which; *iha* — in this world; *saṁsṛtiḥ* — the experience of material life.

### Translation

**The spirit soul is inexhaustible, transcendental, pure, self-luminous and never covered by anything material. It is like fire. But the nonliving material body, like firewood, is dull and unaware. So in this world, who is it that actually undergoes the experience of material life?**

### Purport

The words *anāvṛtaḥ* and *agni-vat* are significant here. Fire can never be covered with darkness because by nature fire is illuminating. Similarly, the spirit soul is *svayaṁ-jyotiḥ,* or self-luminous, and thus the soul is transcendental — he can never be covered by the darkness of material life. On the other hand, the material body, like firewood, is by nature dull and unilluminated. In itself it does not have any awareness of life. If the soul is transcendental to material life and the body is not even conscious of it, the following question arises: How does our experience of material existence actually take place?

*yāvad dehendriya-prāṇair

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*bhagavān* *uvāca* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; *yāvat* — as long as; *deha* — by the body; *indriya* — senses; *prāṇaiḥ* — and vital force; *ātmanaḥ* — of the soul; *sannikarṣaṇam* — attraction; *saṁsāraḥ* — material existence; *phala*-*vān* — fruitful; *tāvat* — for that duration; *apārthaḥ* — meaningless; *api* — although; *avivekinaḥ* — for the undiscriminating.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: As long as the foolish spirit soul remains attracted to the material body, senses and vital force, his material existence continues to flourish, although it is ultimately meaningless.**

### Purport

Here the word *sannikarṣaṇam* indicates that the pure spirit soul voluntarily connects himself with the material body, considering this a most fruitful arrangement. Actually, the situation is *apārtha,* useless, unless one uses one’s embodied situation to engage in the loving service of the Lord. At that time one’s connection is actually with Lord Kṛṣṇa, not with the body, which becomes a mere instrument for executing one’s higher purpose.

### Synonyms

*arthe* — real cause; *hi* — certainly; *avidyamāne* — not existing; *api* — although; *saṁsṛtiḥ* — the material existential condition; *na* — not; *nivartate* — does cease; *dhyāyataḥ* — contemplating; *viṣayān* — objects of the senses; *asya* — of the living entity; *svapne* — in a dream; *anartha* — of disadvantages; *āgamaḥ* — arrival; *yathā* — like.

### Translation

**Actually, the living entity is transcendental to material existence. But because of his mentality of lording it over material nature, his material existential condition does not cease, and, just as in a dream, he is affected by all sorts of disadvantages.**

### Purport

This same verse and other very similar verses occur elsewhere in the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:* Third Canto, Chapter Twenty-seven, verse 4; Fourth Canto, Chapter Twenty-nine, verses 35 and 73; and Eleventh Canto, Chapter Twenty-two, verse 56. In fact, this verse completely explains the essence of illusion.

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *hi* — indeed; *apratibuddhasya* — for one who has not awakened; *prasvāpaḥ* — sleep; *bahu* — many; *anartha* — undesirable experiences; *bhṛt* — presenting; *saḥ* — that same dream; *eva* — indeed; *pratibuddhasya* — for one who has awakened; *na* — not; *vai* — certainly; *mohāya* — confusion; *kalpate* — generates.

### Translation

**Although while dreaming a person experiences many undesirable things, upon awakening he is no longer confused by the dream experiences.**

### Purport

Even a liberated soul must observe material objects while living in this world. But being awake to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he understands that sensory pains and pleasures, like dreams, are without substance. Thus the liberated soul is not bewildered by illusion.

*śoka-harṣa-bhaya-krodha-  
lobha-moha-spṛhādayaḥ  
ahaṅkārasya dṛśyante  
janma-mṛtyuś ca nātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*śoka* — lamentation; *harṣa* — elation; *bhaya* — fear; *krodha* — anger; *lobha* — greed; *moha* — confusion; *spṛhā* — hankering; *ādayaḥ* — and so on; *ahaṅkārasya* — of false ego; *dṛśyante* — they appear; *janma* — birth; *mṛtyuḥ* — death; *ca* — and; *na* — not; *ātmanaḥ* — of the soul.

### Translation

**Lamentation, elation, fear, anger, greed, confusion and hankering, as well as birth and death, are experiences of the false ego and not of the pure soul.**

### Purport

False ego is the pure soul’s illusory identification with the subtle material mind and the gross material body. As a result of this illusory identification, the conditioned soul feels lamentation for things lost, jubilation over things gained, fear of things inauspicious, anger at the frustration of his desires, and greed for sense gratification. And so, bewildered by such false attractions and aversions, the conditioned soul must accept further material bodies, which means he must undergo repeated births and deaths. One who is self-realized knows that all such mundane emotions have nothing to do with the pure soul, whose natural propensity is to engage in the loving service of the Lord.

### Synonyms

*deha* — with the material body; *indriya* — senses; *prāṇa* — life air; *manaḥ* — and mind; *abhimānaḥ* — who is falsely identifying; *jīvaḥ* — the living entity; *antaḥ* — situated within; *ātmā* — the soul; *guṇa* — according to his material qualities; *karma* — and work; *mūrtiḥ* — assuming his form; *sūtram* — the *sūtra-tattva*; *mahān* — the original form of material nature; *iti* — thus; *urudhā* — in many different ways; *iva* — indeed; *gītaḥ* — described; *saṁsāre* — in material life; *ādhāvati* — he runs about; *kāla* — of time; *tantraḥ* — under the strict control.

### Translation

**The living entity who falsely identifies with his body, senses, life air and mind, and who dwells within these coverings, assumes the form of his own materially conditioned qualities and work. He is designated variously in relation to the total material energy, and thus, under the strict control of supreme time, he is forced to run here and there within material existence.**

### Purport

False ego, which causes the living entity to suffer material existence, is here described in detail as the illusory identification with the material body, senses, life air and mind. The word *kāla* refers directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who imposes the limiting segments of time upon the conditioned souls, keeping them tightly bound under the laws of nature. Liberation is not an impersonal experience; liberation is attainment of one’s eternal body, senses, mind and intelligence in the association of the Personality of Godhead. We can revive our eternal, liberated personality, free from the contamination of false ego, by dedicating ourselves to the loving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When the pure spirit soul accepts the false ego, he must undergo material suffering. One automatically conquers the false ego by accepting oneself, in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to be the eternal servant of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

### Synonyms

*amūlam* — without foundation; *etat* — this (false ego); *bahu*-*rūpa* — in many forms; *rūpitam* — ascertained; *manaḥ* — of the mind; *vacaḥ* — speech; *prāṇa* — the life air; *śarīra* — and the gross body; *karma* — the functions; *jñāna* — of transcendental knowledge; *asinā* — by the sword; *upāsanayā* — through devotional worship (of the spiritual master); *śitena* — which has been sharpened; *chittvā* — cutting off; *muniḥ* — a sober sage; *gām* — this earth; *vicarati* — wanders; *atṛṣṇaḥ* — free from material desires.

### Translation

**Although the false ego has no factual basis, it is perceived in many forms — as the functions of the mind, speech, life air and bodily faculties. But with the sword of transcendental knowledge, sharpened by worship of a bona fide spiritual master, a sober sage will cut off this false identification and live in this world free from all material attachment.**

### Purport

The word *bahu-rūpa-rūpitam,* “perceived in many forms,” also indicates that the false ego is manifest in the belief that one is a demigod, a great man, a beautiful lady, an oppressed worker, a tiger, a bird, an insect and so on. By the influence of false ego, the pure soul accepts some material covering to be his ultimate self, but such ignorance can be removed by the process described in this verse.

*jñānam* — transcendental knowledge; *vivekaḥ* — discrimination; *nigamaḥ* — the scripture; *tapaḥ* — austerity; *ca* — and; *pratyakṣam* — direct perception; *aitihyam* — the historical accounts of the *Purāṇas*; *atha* — and; *anumānam* — logic; *ādi* — in the beginning; *antayoḥ* — and the end; *asya* — of this creation; *yat* — which; *eva* — indeed; *kevalam* — alone; *kālaḥ* — the controlling factor of time; *ca* — and; *hetuḥ* — the ultimate cause; *ca* — and; *tat* — that; *eva* — alone; *madhye* — in the middle.

### Translation

**Real spiritual knowledge is based on the discrimination of spirit from matter, and it is cultivated by scriptural evidence, austerity, direct perception, reception of the Purāṇas’ historical narrations, and logical inference. The Absolute Truth, which alone was present before the creation of the universe and which alone will remain after its destruction, is also the time factor and the ultimate cause. Even in the middle stage of this creation’s existence, the Absolute Truth alone is the actual reality.**

### Purport

Material scientists and philosophers are desperately searching for the ultimate material cause or principle, which is described here as *kāla,* the time factor. The material process of cause and effect takes place entirely within a sequence of time; in other words, the time factor is the motivating impetus for material cause and effect. This time factor is a manifestation of the Supersoul, the form of the Supreme Lord that pervades and supports the cosmic manifestation. The method for acquiring knowledge is scientifically described here, and those who are serious, reasonable scholars will take advantage of the transcendental epistemology revealed here by the Lord.

*yathā* — just as; *hiraṇyam* — gold; *su*-*akṛtam* — unmanifest as manufactured products; *purastāt* — previously; *paścāt* — subsequently; *ca* — and; *sarvasya* — of everything; *hiraṇ*-*mayasya* — that is made of gold; *tat* — that gold; *eva* — alone; *madhye* — in the middle; *vyavahāryamāṇam* — being utilized; *nānā* — various; *apadeśaiḥ* — in terms of designations; *aham* — I; *asya* — of this created universe; *tadvat* — in the same way.

### Translation

**Gold alone is present before its manufacture into gold products, the gold alone remains after the products’ destruction, and the gold alone is the essential reality while it is being utilized under various designations. Similarly, I alone exist before the creation of this universe, after its destruction and during its maintenance.**

### Purport

Gold is manufactured into many types of jewelry, as well as into coins and other luxurious products. But at each stage — before manufacture, during manufacture, during utilization and afterward — the essential reality is gold. In the same way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essential reality — both the dynamic and the ingredient cause of everything. All throughout the material creation, the Lord is simply setting into motion His own potency, which is not different from Him.

guṇa-trayaṁ kāraṇa-kārya-kartṛ  
samanvayena vyatirekataś ca

### Synonyms

*vijñānam* — (the mind, whose symptom is) full knowledge; *etat* — this; *tri*-*avastham* — existing in three conditions (wakeful consciousness, sleep and deep sleep); *aṅga* — My dear Uddhava; *guṇa*-*trayam* — manifesting through the three modes of nature; *kāraṇa* — as the subtle cause (*adhyātma*); *kārya* — the gross product (*adhibhūta*); *kartṛ* — and the producer (*adhidaiva*); *samanvayena* — in each of them, one after another; *vyatirekataḥ* — as separate; *ca* — and; *yena* — by which; *eva* — indeed; *turyeṇa* — fourth factor; *tat* — that; *eva* — alone; *satyam* — is the Absolute Truth.

### Translation

**The material mind manifests in three phases of consciousness — wakefulness, sleep and deep sleep — which are products of the three modes of nature. The mind further appears in three different roles — the perceiver, the perceived and the regulator of perception. Thus the mind is manifested variously throughout these threefold designations. But it is the fourth factor, existing separately from all this, that alone constitutes the Absolute Truth.**

### Purport

As stated in *Kaṭha Upaniṣad* (2.2.15), *tam eva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṁ/ tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṁ vibhāti:* “Everything radiates its illumination in pursuance of His original illumination; His light illuminates everything in this universe.” As thus described, the entire range of perception, cognition and sensitivity is an insignificant expansion of the perception, cognition and sensitivity of the Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**That which did not exist in the past and will not exist in the future also has no existence of its own for the period of its duration, but is only a superficial designation. In My opinion, whatever is created and revealed by something else is ultimately only that other thing.**

### Purport

Although all material products, such as our own bodies, are temporary and thus ultimately false, the material world is a real manifestation of the Lord’s potency. The basic substance, or reality, of this world is the Personality of Godhead Himself, whereas the temporary designations imposed by the conditioned souls are illusion. Thus we consider ourselves American, Russian, British, German, Indian, black, white, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so forth. In fact, we are the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, but by attempting to exploit the Lord’s inferior material potency we have become entangled in illusion. Everything should be properly defined in terms of the Personality of Godhead, who is the essential reality of this and all other worlds.

vaikāriko rājasa-sarga eṣaḥ

### Synonyms

*avidyamānaḥ* — actually not existing; *api* — although; *avabhāsate* — appears; *yaḥ* — which; *vaikārikaḥ* — manifestation of transformations; *rājasa* — of the mode of passion; *sargaḥ* — the creation; *eṣaḥ* — this; *brahma* — the Absolute Truth (on the other hand); *svayam* — established in Himself; *jyotiḥ* — luminous; *ataḥ* — therefore; *vibhāti* — becomes manifest; *brahma* — the Absolute Truth; *indriya* — of the senses; *artha* — their objects; *ātma* — the mind; *vikāra* — and of the transformations of the five gross elements; *citram* — as the variety.

### Translation

**Although thus not existing in reality, this manifestation of transformations created from the mode of passion appears real because the self-manifested, self-luminous Absolute Truth exhibits Himself in the form of the material variety of the senses, the sense objects, the mind and the elements of physical nature.**

### Purport

The total material nature, *pradhāna,* is originally undifferentiated and inert, but later it undergoes transformation when the Supreme Lord, through His time agent, glances upon it and activates the mode of passion. Material transformation thus takes place and is exhibited as the Lord’s inferior energy. In contrast, the Supreme Lord’s personal abode possesses eternal variety, which is the self-luminous, internal opulence of the Absolute Truth and is not subject to material creation, transformation or annihilation. The material world is in this way simultaneously one with and different from the Absolute Truth.

*evam* — in this way; *sphuṭam* — clearly; *brahma* — of the Absolute Truth; *viveka*-*hetubhiḥ* — by discriminating, logical arguments; *para* — of misidentification with other conceptions; *apavādena* — by refutation; *viśāradena* — expert; *chittvā* — cutting off; *ātma* — regarding the identity of the self; *sandeham* — doubt; *upārameta* — one should desist; *sva*-*ānanda* — in his own transcendental ecstasy; *tuṣṭaḥ* — satisfied; *akhila* — from all; *kāmukebhyaḥ* — things of lust.

### Translation

**Thus clearly understanding by discriminating logic the unique position of the Absolute Truth, one should expertly refute one’s misidentification with matter and cut to pieces all doubts about the identity of the self. Becoming satisfied in the soul’s natural ecstasy, one should desist from all lusty engagements of the material senses.**

### Translation

**The material body made of earth is not the true self; nor are the senses, their presiding demigods or the air of life; nor is the external air, water or fire or one’s mind. All these are simply matter. Similarly, neither one’s intelligence, material consciousness nor ego, nor the elements of ether or earth, nor the objects of sense perception, nor even the primeval state of material equilibrium can be considered the actual identity of the soul.**

### Translation

**For one who has properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme Godhead, what credit is there if his senses — mere products of the material modes — are perfectly concentrated in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds come and go?**

### Purport

A pure devotee of the Lord is considered eternally liberated, because he has perfectly understood the Lord’s transcendental personality and abode and is always engaged in serving the Lord’s mission within this world. Although superficially such a devotee may appear agitated by events in the material world while engaged in the Lord’s mission, this does not change his exalted status as the Lord’s eternal servitor, just as the exalted status of the sun is not changed even when the sun is apparently covered by clouds.

### Translation

**The sky may display the various qualities of the air, fire, water and earth that pass through it, as well as such qualities as heat and cold, which continually come and go with the seasons. Yet the sky is never entangled with any of these qualities. Similarly, the Supreme Absolute Truth is never entangled with the contaminations of goodness, passion and ignorance, which cause the material transformations of the false ego.**

### Purport

The word *ahaṁ-mateḥ* here indicates the conditioned living entity, who becomes manifest with the false ego of a particular material body. By contrast, the Personality of Godhead is unaffected by the modes of nature, and thus He is never covered by a material body and never subject to false ego. As described here, the Lord is eternally infallible and pure.

### Translation

**Nevertheless, until by firmly practicing devotional service to Me one has completely eliminated from his mind all contamination of material passion, one must very carefully avoid associating with the material modes, which are produced by My illusory energy.**

### Purport

The word *tathāpi* in this verse indicates that even though the material nature is nondifferent from the Supreme Lord (as elaborately described in this chapter), one who has yet to conquer material desire should not artificially associate with material things, declaring them to be nondifferent from the Lord. Thus one aspiring to be Kṛṣṇa conscious should not loosely associate with women, claiming them to be nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead, for by such imitation of the most advanced devotees one will become a sense gratifier. A neophyte devotee who presumes himself liberated is impelled by the mode of passion to become falsely proud of his position, and thus he neglects the actual process of devotional service to the Lord. One must have firm and steady engagement in the loving service of the Lord, under the direction of higher authorities; then advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be easy and sublime.

### Translation

**Just as an improperly treated disease recurs and gives repeated distress to the patient, the mind that is not completely purified of its perverted tendencies will remain attached to material things and repeatedly torment the imperfect yogī.**

### Purport

*Sarva-saṅgam* refers to one’s stubborn attachment to material objects of so-called enjoyment, such as children, wife, money, nation and friends. One who increases his attachment to children, wife and so on, although supposedly performing devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, is understood to be either a *kuyogī,* as described in this verse, or a bewildered neophyte who has failed to properly treat the disease of the heart called material attachment. If one has repeated relapses into material attachment, he has failed to eradicate the darkness of ignorance from his heart.

### Synonyms

*ku*-*yoginaḥ* — those practitioners of *yoga* whose knowledge is not complete; *ye* — who; *vihita* — imposed; *antarāyaiḥ* — by obstructions; *manuṣya*-*bhūtaiḥ* — in the form of human beings (their relatives, disciples and so on); *tridaśa* — by the demigods; *upasṛṣṭaiḥ* — sent; *te* — they; *prāktana* — of the previous life; *abhyāsa* — of the accumulated practice; *balena* — on the strength; *bhūyaḥ* — once again; *yuñjanti* — engage; *yogam* — in spiritual practice; *na* — never; *tu* — however; *karma*-*tantram* — the entanglement of fruitive work.

### Translation

**Sometimes the progress of imperfect transcendentalists is checked by attachment to family members, disciples or others, who are sent by envious demigods for that purpose. But on the strength of their accumulated advancement, such imperfect transcendentalists will resume their practice of yoga in the next life. They will never again be trapped in the network of fruitive work.**

### Purport

Sometimes *sannyāsīs* and other spiritual teachers are bewildered by flattering followers and disciples sent by the demigods to embarrass spiritual leaders who are lacking complete spiritual knowledge. Similarly, spiritual progress is sometimes checked by attachment to one’s bodily relatives. Although an imperfect transcendentalist may fall down from *yoga* practice in this life, he will resume it in the next life on the strength of his accumulated merit, as described in the *Bhagavad-gītā.* The words *na tu karma-tantram* indicate that a fallen transcendentalist does not have to pass through the lower stages of fruitive activity and gradually be promoted to the practice of *yoga.* Rather, he will immediately resume his *yoga* practice at that point at which he left it. Of course, one should not presume to fall back on the facility offered here but should try to become perfect in this lifetime. *Sannyāsīs,* especially, should remove the knot of lust from their hearts and should avoid falling into the clutches of flattering followers or female disciples sent by the demigods to expose a so-called spiritual leader who is imperfect in Kṛṣṇa conscious knowledge.

करोति कर्म क्रियते च जन्तु-  
केनाप्यसौ चोदित आनिपातात् ।  
न तत्र विद्वान् प्रकृतौ स्थितोऽपि  
निवृत्ततृष्ण- स्वसुखानुभूत्या ॥ ३० ॥

### Verse text

*karoti karma kriyate ca jantuḥ  
kenāpy asau codita ā-nipātāt  
na tatra vidvān prakṛtau sthito ’pi  
nivṛtta-tṛṣṇaḥ sva-sukhānubhūtyā*

### Synonyms

*karoti* — he performs; *karma* — material work; *kriyate* — is acted upon; *ca* — also; *jantuḥ* — the living entity; *kena* *api* — by some force or other; *asau* — he; *coditaḥ* — impelled; *ā*-*nipātāt* — up to the point of death; *na* — not; *tatra* — there; *vidvān* — a wise person; *prakṛtau* — in material nature; *sthitaḥ* — situated; *api* — even though; *nivṛtta* — having given up; *tṛṣṇaḥ* — material desire; *sva* — by his own; *sukha* — of happiness; *anubhūtyā* — experience.

### Translation

**An ordinary living entity performs material work and is transformed by the reaction to such work. Thus he is driven by various desires to continue working fruitively up to the very moment of his death. A wise person, however, having experienced his own constitutional bliss, gives up all material desires and does not engage in fruitive work.**

### Purport

By sexual association with women, a man is driven to enjoy the female form again and again, and indeed he remains lusty up to the moment of death. Similarly, through association with family and friends the knot of material attachment becomes very tight. Thus the reactions of fruitive work bind one more and more in the cycle of material defeat. But a learned person, one who is in touch with the Supreme Lord within his heart, realizes the ultimate frustration of material work and the danger of entering the womb of a pig or dog in a future life as the result of sinful activities. One on the platform of self-realization does not regard himself as an enjoyer of the world. Rather, he regards the entire cosmos as simply an insignificant expansion of the Lord’s potency — and himself as the Lord’s humble servant.

### Synonyms

*tiṣṭhantam* — standing; *āsīnam* — sitting; *uta* — or; *vrajantam* — walking; *śayānam* — lying down; *ukṣantam* — urinating; *adantam* — eating; *annam* — food; *sva*-*bhāvam* — manifested from his conditioned nature; *anyat* — other; *kim* *api* — whatever; *īhamānam* — executing; *ātmānam* — his own bodily self; *ātma*-*stha* — fixed in the true self; *matiḥ* — whose consciousness; *na* *veda* — he does not recognize.

### Translation

**The wise man, whose consciousness is fixed in the self, does not even notice his own bodily activities. While standing, sitting, walking, lying down, urinating, eating or performing other bodily functions, he understands that the body is acting according to its own nature.**

यदि स्म पश्यत्यसदिन्द्रियार्थं

### Verse text

*yadi sma paśyaty asad-indriyārthaṁ  
nānānumānena viruddham anyat  
na manyate vastutayā manīṣī  
svāpnaṁ yathotthāya tirodadhānam*

### Synonyms

*yadi* — if; *sma* — ever; *paśyati* — he sees; *asat* — impure; *indriya*-*artham* — sense objects; *nānā* — of their being based on duality; *anumānena* — by the logical inference; *viruddham* — refuted; *anyat* — separate from true reality; *na* *manyate* — does not accept; *vastutayā* — as real; *manīṣī* — the intelligent man; *svāpnam* — of a dream; *yathā* — as if; *utthāya* — waking; *tirodadhānam* — which is in the process of disappearing.

### Translation

**Although a self-realized soul may sometimes see an impure object or activity, he does not accept it as real. By logically understanding impure sense objects to be based on illusory material duality, the intelligent person sees them to be contrary to and distinct from reality, in the same way that a man awakening from sleep views his fading dream.**

### Purport

A sane person can clearly distinguish between a dream experience and his real life. Similarly a *manīṣī,* or intelligent person, can clearly perceive polluted material sense objects to be creations of the Lord’s illusory energy and not factual reality. This is the practical test of realized intelligence.

### Verse text

*pūrvaṁ gṛhītaṁ guṇa-karma-citram  
ajñānam ātmany aviviktam aṅga  
nivartate tat punar īkṣayaiva  
na gṛhyate nāpi visṛjya ātmā*

### Synonyms

*pūrvam* — previously; *gṛhītam* — accepted; *guṇa* — of the modes of nature; *karma* — by the activities; *citram* — made varied; *ajñānam* — the ignorance; *ātmani* — upon the soul; *aviviktam* — imposed as identical; *aṅga* — My dear Uddhava; *nivartate* — ceases; *tat* — that; *punaḥ* — again; *īkṣayā* — by knowledge; *eva* — alone; *na* *gṛhyate* — is not accepted; *na* — nor; *api* — indeed; *visṛjya* — being rejected; *ātmā* — the soul.

### Translation

**Material nescience, which expands into many varieties by the activities of the modes of nature, is wrongly accepted by the conditioned soul to be identical with the self. But through the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, My dear Uddhava, this same nescience fades away at the time of liberation. The eternal self, on the other hand, is never assumed and never abandoned.**

### Purport

It is emphasized here that the eternal self is never assumed or imposed as a material designation, nor is it ever abandoned. As explained in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the soul is eternally the same and does not undergo transformation. The modes of nature, however, create the gross material body and subtle mind as a result of one’s previous fruitive activities, and these gross and subtle bodies are imposed upon the soul. Thus the living entity can neither assume nor reject the soul, which is an eternal fact. Rather, he should give up the gross ignorance of material consciousness by cultivating spiritual knowledge, as indicated here.

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *hi* — indeed; *bhānoḥ* — of the sun; *udayaḥ* — the rising; *nṛ* — human; *cakṣuṣām* — of eyes; *tamaḥ* — the darkness; *nihanyāt* — destroys; *na* — not; *tu* — but; *sat* — objects that exist; *vidhatte* — creates; *evam* — similarly; *samīkṣā* — full realization; *nipuṇā* — potent; *satī* — true; *me* — of Me; *hanyāt* — destroys; *tamisram* — the darkness; *puruṣasya* — of a person; *buddheḥ* — in the intelligence.

### Translation

**When the sun rises it destroys the darkness covering men’s eyes, but it does not create the objects they then see before them, which in fact were existing all along. Similarly, potent and factual realization of Me will destroy the darkness covering a person’s true consciousness.**

mahānubhūtiḥ sakalānubhūtiḥ  
eko ’dvitīyo vacasāṁ virāme

### Synonyms

*eṣaḥ* — this (Supersoul); *svayam*-*jyotiḥ* — self-luminous; *ajaḥ* — unborn; *aprameyaḥ* — impossible to measure; *mahā*-*anubhūtiḥ* — full of transcendental consciousness; *sakala*-*anubhūtiḥ* — aware of everything; *ekaḥ* — one; *advitīyaḥ* — without a second; *vacasām* *virāme* — (realized only) when material words cease; *yena* — by whom; *īṣitāḥ* — impelled; *vāk* — speech; *asavaḥ* — and the life airs; *caranti* — move.

### Translation

**The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, unborn and immeasurable. He is pure transcendental consciousness and perceives everything. One without a second, He is realized only after ordinary words cease. By Him the power of speech and the life airs are set into motion.**

### Purport

The Supreme Lord is self-luminous, self-manifested, whereas the individual living entity is manifested by Him. The Lord is unborn, but the living entity, because of material, designative coverings, takes birth in conditioned life. The Lord is immeasurable, being all-pervasive, whereas the living entity is localized. The Supreme Lord is *mahānubhūti,* the totality of consciousness, whereas the living entity is a tiny spark of consciousness. The Lord is *sakalānubhūti,* omniscient, whereas the living entity is aware only of his own limited experience. The Supreme Lord is one, whereas the living entities are innumerable. Considering all these contrasts between the Lord and ourselves, we should not waste time like the foolish material scientists and philosophers, who struggle to find the origin of this world by their insignificant mental speculation and word jugglery. Although one may discover some of the gross laws of material nature through material research, there is no hope of achieving the Absolute Truth by such petty endeavors.

### Verse text

*etāvān ātma-sammoho  
yad vikalpas tu kevale  
ātman ṛte svam ātmānam  
avalambo na yasya hi*

### Synonyms

*etāvān* — whatever; *ātma* — of the self; *sammohaḥ* — delusion; *yat* — which; *vikalpaḥ* — idea of duality; *tu* — but; *kevale* — in the unique; *ātman* — in the self; *ṛte* — without; *svam* — that very; *ātmānam* — self; *avalambaḥ* — basis; *na* — there is not; *yasya* — of which (duality); *hi* — indeed.

### Translation

**Whatever apparent duality is perceived in the self is simply the confusion of the mind. Indeed, such supposed duality has no basis to rest upon apart from one’s own soul.**

### Purport

As explained in verse 33 of this chapter, the eternal self is neither assumed nor lost, since every living entity is an eternal reality. The word *vikalpa,* or “duality,” here refers to the mistaken idea that the spirit soul is partly composed of matter in the form of the gross body or subtle mind. It is thus that foolish persons consider the material body or mind to be an intrinsic or fundamental component of the self. In fact the living entity is pure spirit, without any tinge of matter. Consequently the false ego, which is generated by the false identification with matter, is a mistaken identity imposed upon the pure spirit soul. The sense of ego, or “I am” — in other words, the sense of one’s individual identity — comes from the spirit soul, because there is no other possible basis for such self-awareness. By studying one’s false sense of ego, one can analytically understand that there is a pure ego, which is expressed by the words *ahaṁ brahmāsmi,* “I am pure spirit soul.” One can easily understand in a similar way that there is a supreme spirit soul, the Personality of Godhead, who is the omniscient controller of everything. Such understanding in Kṛṣṇa consciousness constitutes perfect knowledge, as described here by the Lord.

यन्नामाकृतिभिर्ग्राह्यं पञ्चवर्णमबाधितम् ।

*yan nāmākṛtibhir grāhyaṁ  
pañca-varṇam abādhitam  
vyarthenāpy artha-vādo ’yaṁ  
dvayaṁ paṇḍita-māninām*

### Synonyms

*yat* — which; *nāma* — by names; *ākṛtibhiḥ* — and forms; *grāhyam* — perceivable; *pañca*-*varṇam* — consisting of the five material elements; *abādhitam* — undeniable; *vyarthena* — in vain; *api* — indeed; *artha*-*vādaḥ* — the imaginative interpretation; *ayam* — this; *dvayam* — duality; *paṇḍita*-*māninām* — of so-called scholars.

### Translation

**The duality of the five material elements is perceived only in terms of names and forms. Those who say this duality is real are pseudoscholars vainly proposing fanciful theories without basis in fact.**

### Purport

Material names and forms, subject as they are to creation and annihilation, have no permanent existence and so do not constitute essential, fundamental principles of reality. The material world consists of variegated transformations of the potency of God. Although God is real and His potency is real, the particular forms and names that temporarily or circumstantially appear have no ultimate reality. Gross ignorance occurs when the conditioned soul imagines himself to be material or a mixture of matter and spirit. Some philosophers argue that the eternal soul in contact with matter is permanently transformed and that the false ego represents a new and permanent reality of the soul. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī replies that spirit is the living, superior energy of the Lord, whereas matter is the inferior, unconscious energy of the Lord, and that these two energies thus possess opposite qualities, as with light and darkness. The superior living entity and inferior matter therefore cannot possibly merge into a common existence, since they eternally possess opposite and incompatible characteristics. The hallucination of a mixture of matter and spirit is called illusion; it becomes specifically manifest as false ego, which identifies with a specific material body or mind created by illusion. Clearly those scientists or philosophers who are embedded in gross ignorance cannot be real scientists and philosophers. The simple criterion of spiritual self-awareness unfortunately eliminates a huge percentage of modern so-called scientists and philosophers, who bury their foolish noses in the Lord’s material energy, without any knowledge of or interest in the Lord Himself.

### Verse text

*yogino ’pakva-yogasya

### Synonyms

*yoginaḥ* — of the *yogī*; *apakva*-*yogasya* — who is immature in the practice of *yoga*; *yuñjataḥ* — trying to engage; *kāyaḥ* — the body; *utthitaiḥ* — which have arisen; *upasargaiḥ* — by disturbances; *vihanyeta* — may be frustrated; *tatra* — in that connection; *ayam* — this; *vihitaḥ* — is prescribed; *vidhiḥ* — recommended process.

### Translation

**The physical body of the endeavoring yogī who is not yet mature in his practice may sometimes be overcome by various disturbances. Therefore the following process is recommended.**

### Purport

Having described the process of cultivating knowledge, the Lord now gives instructions to the *yogī* whose body may be disturbed by disease or other impediments. Those inferior *yogīs* who are attached to the body and bodily exercises are often incomplete in their realization, and thus the Lord here offers them some assistance.

### Translation

**These inauspicious disturbances can be gradually removed by constant remembrance of Me, by congregational hearing and chanting of My holy names, or by following in the footsteps of the great masters of yoga.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, by meditation on the Supreme Lord one can overcome lust and other mental disturbances, and by following in the footsteps of great transcendentalists one can overcome hypocrisy, false pride and other types of mental imbalance.

### Translation

**By various methods, some yogīs free the body from disease and old age and keep it perpetually youthful. Thus they engage in yoga for the purpose of achieving material mystic perfections.**

### Purport

The process described here is meant to fulfill one’s material desires, not to bring one transcendental knowledge. Therefore this process cannot be accepted as devotional service to the Lord, according to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Despite all such mystic perfections, the material body will ultimately die. Actual eternal youth and happiness are available only on the spiritual platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

*na* — not; *hi* — indeed; *tat* — that; *kuśala* — by those expert in transcendental knowledge; *ādṛtyam* — to be respected; *tat* — of that; *āyāsaḥ* — the endeavor; *hi* — certainly; *apārthakaḥ* — useless; *anta*-*vattvāt* — because of being subject to destruction; *śarīrasya* — on the part of the material body; *phalasya* — of the fruit; *iva* — just as; *vanaspateḥ* — of a tree.

### Translation

**This mystic bodily perfection is not valued very highly by those expert in transcendental knowledge. Indeed, they consider endeavor for such perfection useless, since the soul, like a tree, is permanent, but the body, like a tree’s fruit, is subject to destruction.**

### Purport

The example given here is of a tree that seasonally bears fruit. The fruit exists for a very short time, whereas the tree may exist for thousands of years. Similarly, the spirit soul is eternal, whereas the material body, even when preserved as long as possible, is destroyed relatively quickly. The body should never be equated with the eternally existing spirit soul. Those who are actually intelligent, who actually have spiritual knowledge, are not interested in material mystic perfections.

### Translation

**Although the physical body may be improved by various processes of yoga, an intelligent person who has dedicated his life to Me does not place his faith in the prospect of perfecting his physical body through yoga, and in fact he gives up such procedures.**

### Purport

A devotee of the Lord keeps his body fit by eating nourishing Kṛṣṇa *prasādam,* by maintaining a clean and regulated life, free from unnecessary anxiety, and by chanting and dancing before the Deity of the Lord. When a devotee is sick, he accepts medical treatment by normal methods, but beyond this there is no need to absorb one’s mind in the physical body in the name of so-called *yoga* practice. Ultimately one must accept the destiny that has been ordained by the Lord.

### Translation

**The yogī who has taken shelter of Me remains free from hankering because he experiences the happiness of the soul within. Thus while executing this process of yoga, he is never defeated by obstacles.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the Supreme Lord has briefly described to Uddhava the essential wisdom of all the *Upaniṣads,* with the conclusion that pure devotional service to the Lord is the real means of ultimate liberation. In this regard Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura emphasizes that although *haṭha-yogīs* and *rāja-yogīs* try to make progress along their prescribed paths, they confront obstacles and often fail to achieve their desired goals. However, one who surrenders to the Supreme Lord will certainly be victorious on his spiritual path back home, back to Godhead.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Jñāna-yoga.”*
