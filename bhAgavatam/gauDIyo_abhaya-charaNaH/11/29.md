CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE

Thinking that the previously described spiritual practice, based on detachment, is too difficult, Uddhava inquired about an easier method. In reply, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa gave brief instructions on devotional service.

The fruitive workers and mystic *yogīs,* who are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and puffed up by their false identifications, refuse to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. But the swanlike men, those who know how to discriminate between the essential and nonessential, always take shelter at the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord Himself — within the living entity as the *caittya-guru* and without as the spiritual master who teaches by example — eradicates all the misfortune of the spirit soul and reveals His own personal form.

One should execute all duties for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, keeping one’s mind absorbed in Him. One should take advantage of the sacred abodes of the Lord, where His devotees reside, and one should serve the Lord and celebrate the festivals and holidays in His honor. By understanding all living beings to be Lord Kṛṣṇa’s place of residence, one can attain the ability to see equally everywhere, and thus all faulty qualities of envy, false ego and so on will be removed. Bearing this in mind, the devotee should give up his proud relatives, his separatist outlook and his mundane embarrassment and should offer obeisances flat on the ground to all, even the dogs and outcastes. As long as one has not learned to see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all creatures, he must continue to use his body, mind and speech to worship the Supreme Lord in that manner of offering full obeisances to all.

Because this eternal process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord is transcendental and has been established by the Lord Himself, it can never, to the slightest extent, be defeated or prove fruitless. When one offers himself completely to the Supreme Lord with exclusive devotion, the Lord becomes particularly pleased, and thus the devotee achieves immortality, becoming qualified to obtain opulence equal to that of the Lord.

After receiving these instructions, Śrī Uddhava went to Badarikāśrama in pursuance of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s order, and by perfectly carrying out the instructions of the Supreme Lord, he attained the Lord’s transcendental abode. By faithfully serving these instructions spoken by the Personality of Godhead to Uddhava, the greatest of devotees, the entire world can become liberated.

### Verse text

*prāyaśaḥ puṇḍarīkākṣa  
yuñjanto yogino manaḥ  
viṣīdanty asamādhānān  
mano-nigraha-karśitāḥ*

### Synonyms

*prāyaśaḥ* — for the most part; *puṇḍarīka*-*akṣa* — O lotus-eyed Lord; *yuñjantaḥ* — who engage; *yoginaḥ* — *yogīs*; *manaḥ* — the mind; *viṣīdanti* — become frustrated; *asamādhānāt* — because of inability to attain trance; *manaḥ*-*nigraha* — by the attempt to subdue the mind; *karśitāḥ* — weary.

### Translation

### Purport

Without the shelter of the Supreme Lord, a *yogī* easily becomes discouraged in the difficult task of fixing his mind on the Supreme.

haṁsāḥ śrayerann aravinda-locana  
sukhaṁ nu viśveśvara yoga-karmabhis  
tvan-māyayāmī vihatā na māninaḥ*

### Synonyms

*atha* — now; *ataḥ* — therefore; *ānanda*-*dugham* — the source of all ecstasy; *pada*-*ambujam* — Your lotus feet; *haṁsāḥ* — the swanlike men; *śrayeran* — take shelter of; *aravinda*-*locana* — O lotus-eyed; *sukham* — happily; *nu* — indeed; *viśva*-*īśvara* — Lord of the universe; *yoga*-*karmabhiḥ* — because of their practice of mysticism and fruitive work; *tvat*-*māyayā* — by Your material energy; *amī* — these; *vihatāḥ* — defeated; *na* — do not (take shelter); *māninaḥ* — those who are falsely proud.

### Translation

**Therefore, O lotus-eyed Lord of the universe, swanlike men happily take shelter of Your lotus feet, the source of all transcendental ecstasy. But those who take pride in their accomplishments in yoga and karma fail to take shelter of You and are defeated by Your illusory energy.**

### Purport

Śrī Uddhava emphasizes here that one can achieve spiritual perfection simply by taking shelter of the Personality of Godhead. Those who do so are called *haṁsāḥ,* the most discriminating human beings, since they are able to locate the actual source of spiritual happiness, the Lord’s lotus feet. The word *yoga-karmabhiḥ* indicates that those who are attracted to or proud of achievements in the field of mystic *yoga* or ordinary material endeavor cannot appreciate the great advantage of obediently surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally the *yogīs* and fruitive workers are proud of their so-called achievements and are more attracted to their own endeavor than to the Lord Himself. By humbly taking shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one can advance easily and quickly on the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and go back home, back to Godhead.

yo ’rocayat saha mṛgaiḥ svayam īśvarāṇāṁ  
śrīmat-kirīṭa-taṭa-pīḍita-pāda-pīṭhaḥ*

### Synonyms

*kim* — what; *citram* — wonder; *acyuta* — O infallible Lord; *tava* — Your; *etat* — this; *aśeṣa*-*bandho* — O friend of all; *dāseṣu* — for the servants; *ananya*-*śaraṇeṣu* — who have taken no other shelter; *yat* — which; *ātma*-*sāttvam* — intimacy with You; *yaḥ* — who; *arocayat* — acted affectionately; *saha* — with; *mṛgaiḥ* — the animals (monkeys); *svayam* — Yourself; *īśvarāṇām* — of the great demigods; *śrīmat* — effulgent; *kirīṭa* — of the helmets; *taṭa* — by the edges; *pīḍita* — shaken; *pāda*-*pīṭhaḥ* — whose footstool.

### Translation

**My dear infallible Lord, it is not very astonishing that You intimately approach Your servants who have taken exclusive shelter of You. After all, during Your appearance as Lord Rāmacandra, even while great demigods like Brahmā were vying to place the effulgent tips of their helmets upon the cushion where Your lotus feet rested, You displayed special affection for monkeys such as Hanumān because they had taken exclusive shelter of You.**

### Purport

The devotees of the Lord become completely successful by the Lord’s causeless mercy. Sometimes Lord Kṛṣṇa accepts a position of subservience to His great devotees, as with Nanda Mahārāja, the *gopīs,* Bali Mahārāja and others. Although demigods like Lord Brahmā were standing in line to touch their helmets to the Lord’s foot cushion, still Lord Rāmacandra awarded His most intimate friendship to subhumans, such as the monkeys headed by Hanumān. Similarly Lord Kṛṣṇa’s affection for the deer and cows, and even for the trees of Vṛndāvana, is well known. Further, the Lord gladly drove the chariot of Arjuna and acted as the messenger and faithful subordinate of King Yudhiṣṭhira. Such devotees have no need for the elaborate *jñāna-yoga* systems or the process for achieving mystic powers. All these devotees are represented here by Śrī Uddhava, who frankly informs the Lord that the sophisticated systems of philosophical speculation and mystic *yoga* are not appealing for one who has developed a taste for direct loving service to the Lord.

### Translation

**Who, then, could dare reject You, the very Soul, the most dear object of worship, and the Supreme Lord of all — You who give all possible perfections to the devotees who take shelter of You? Who could be so ungrateful, knowing the benefits You bestow? Who would reject You and accept something for the sake of material enjoyment, which simply leads to forgetfulness of You? And what lack is there for us who are engaged in the service of the dust of Your lotus feet?**

### Purport

As stated in the *Nārāyaṇīya* of the *Mokṣa-dharma,* in *Śrī Mahābhārata:*

*yā vai sādhana-sampattiḥ  
puruṣārtha-catuṣṭaye  
tayā vinā tad āpnoti  
naro nārāyaṇāśrayaḥ*

“Whatever among the four goals of human life can be achieved by various spiritual practices is automatically achieved without such endeavors by the person who has taken shelter of Lord Nārāyaṇa, the refuge of all persons.” Thus a Kṛṣṇa conscious person knows that he will obtain all perfection of life simply by surrendering to the devotional service of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is the highest stage of *yoga,* as confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā.*

### Translation

**O my Lord! Transcendental poets and experts in spiritual science could not fully express their indebtedness to You, even if they were endowed with the prolonged lifetime of Brahmā, for You appear in two features — externally as the ācārya and internally as the Supersoul — to deliver the embodied living being by directing him how to come to You.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, Lord Kṛṣṇa is ten million times more dear to a devotee than life itself. And according to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, even by rendering devotional service for the total duration of one thousand universal creations, a devotee cannot repay the debt he feels to the Lord for having awarded him loving service to the Lord’s lotus feet. The Lord appears within the heart as the Supersoul and externally both as the spiritual master and as His literary incarnation — the supreme Vedic knowledge of *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Verse text

*kuryāt sarvāṇi karmāṇi  
mad-arthaṁ śanakaiḥ smaran  
mayy arpita-manaś-citto  
mad-dharmātma-mano-ratiḥ*

### Synonyms

*kuryāt* — one should perform; *sarvāṇi* — all; *karmāṇi* — prescribed activities; *mat*-*artham* — for Me; *śanakaiḥ* — without becoming impetuous; *smaran* — remembering; *mayi* — unto Me; *arpita* — who has offered; *manaḥ*-*cittaḥ* — his mind and his intelligence; *mat*-*dharma* — My devotional service; *ātma*-*manaḥ* — of his own mind; *ratiḥ* — the attraction.

### Translation

**Always remembering Me, one should perform all his duties for Me without becoming impetuous. With mind and intelligence offered to Me, one should fix his mind in attraction to My devotional service.**

### Purport

The words *mad-dharmātma-mano-ratiḥ* mean that all of one’s love and affection should be devoted to pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not indicated here that one should try to relish selfish satisfaction in devotional service, but rather that one should be attracted to the Lord’s own satisfaction, which one achieves by faithfully executing the order of a bona fide spiritual master coming in disciplic succession from Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Attachment to one’s own satisfaction, even within devotional service, is materialistic, whereas attachment to the satisfaction of the Lord is pure spiritual emotion.

### Translation

**One should take shelter of holy places where My saintly devotees reside, and one should be guided by the exemplary activities of My devotees, who appear among the demigods, demons and human beings.**

### Purport

Nārada Muni is one of the great devotees of the Lord who appeared among the demigods. Prahlāda Mahārāja appeared among the demons, and many other great devotees, such as Ambarīṣa Mahārāja and the Pāṇḍavas, appeared among human beings. One should take shelter of the devotees’ exemplary activities and also the holy places where devotees reside. Thus one will remain safe on the path of devotional service.

Such transcendental scholars searching for the ultimate unity will be attracted by the Lord’s manifestation described here.

### Synonyms

*iti* — in this way; *sarvāṇi* — to all; *bhūtāni* — living beings; *mat*-*bhāvena* — with the sense of My presence; *mahā*-*dyute* — O greatly effulgent Uddhava; *sabhājayan* — giving respect; *manyamānaḥ* — so considering; *jñānam* — knowledge; *kevalam* — transcendental; *āśritaḥ* — taking shelter of; *brāhmaṇe* — in the *brāhmaṇa*; *pukkase* — in the outcaste of the Pukkasa tribe; *stene* — in the thief; *brahmaṇye* — in the man who respects brahminical culture; *arke* — in the sun; *sphuliṅgake* — in the spark of the fire; *akrūre* — in the gentle; *krūrake* — in the cruel; *ca* — also; *eva* — indeed; *sama*-*dṛk* — having equal vision; *paṇḍitaḥ* — a learned scholar; *mataḥ* — is considered.

### Translation

**O brilliant Uddhava, one who thus views all living entities with the idea that I am present within each of them, and who by taking shelter of this divine knowledge offers due respect to everyone, is considered actually wise. Such a man sees equally the brāhmaṇa and the outcaste, the thief and the charitable promoter of brahminical culture, the sun and the tiny sparks of fire, the gentle and the cruel.**

### Purport

A series of opposites is set forth here — namely the high-class *brāhmaṇa* and the low-class aborigine, the thief who steals from respectable persons and the respecter of brahminical culture who gives charity to *brāhmaṇas,* the all-powerful sun and the insignificant spark, and finally the kind and the cruel. Ordinarily, the ability to distinguish between such opposites qualifies one as intelligent. How, then, can the Lord state that ignoring such obvious differences establishes one as a wise man? The answer is given by the words *mad-bhāvena:* a wise person sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead within everything. Therefore, although externally perceiving and dealing with the varieties of material situations, a wise man is more impressed by and concerned with the overwhelming unity of all existence, which is based on the presence of the Supreme Lord within everything. As explained here, a truly wise person is not limited to superficial material discrimination.

*nareṣv abhīkṣṇaṁ mad-bhāvaṁ  
puṁso bhāvayato ’cirāt  
spardhāsūyā-tiraskārāḥ  
sāhaṅkārā viyanti hi*

### Synonyms

*nareṣu* — in all persons; *abhīkṣṇam* — constantly; *mat*-*bhāvam* — the personal presence of Me; *puṁsaḥ* — of the person; *bhāvayataḥ* — who is meditating upon; *acirāt* — quickly; *spardhā* — the tendency to feel rivalry (against equals); *asūyā* — envy (of superiors); *tiraskārāḥ* — and abuse (of inferiors); *sa* — along with; *ahaṅkārāḥ* — false ego; *viyanti* — they disappear; *hi* — indeed.

### Translation

**For him who constantly meditates upon My presence within all persons, the bad tendencies of rivalry, envy and abusiveness, along with false ego, are very quickly destroyed.**

### Purport

We conditioned souls tend to feel rivalry toward our equals, envy toward our superior, and the desire to belittle our subordinates. These contaminated propensities, along with their very basis, false ego, can be quickly vanquished by meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead within every living being.

### Synonyms

*visṛjya* — giving up; *smayamānān* — who are laughing; *svān* — one’s own friends; *dṛśam* — the outlook; *vrīḍām* — the embarrassment; *ca* — and; *daihikīm* — of the bodily conception; *praṇamet* — one should offer obeisances; *daṇḍa*-*vat* — falling down like a rod; *bhūmau* — upon the ground; *ā* — even; *śva* — to the dogs; *cāṇḍāla* — outcastes; *go* — cows; *kharam* — and asses.

### Translation

**Disregarding the ridicule of one’s companions, one should give up the bodily conception and its accompanying embarrassment. One should offer obeisances before all — even the dogs, outcastes, cows and asses — falling flat upon the ground like a rod.**

### Purport

One should practice seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead within all creatures. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised all devotees to consider themselves lower than a blade of grass and to be more tolerant than a tree. In such a humble position, one will not be disturbed in the prosecution of pure devotional service to the Lord. A devotee does not foolishly think that a cow or an ass is God, but rather the devotee sees the Supreme Lord within all creatures, and on this higher, spiritual plane he does not discriminate.

### Verse text

*yāvat sarveṣu bhūteṣu  
mad-bhāvo nopajāyate  
tāvad evam upāsīta  
vāṅ-manaḥ-kāya-vṛttibhiḥ*

### Synonyms

*yāvat* — as long as; *sarveṣu* — in all; *bhūteṣu* — living entities; *mat*-*bhāvaḥ* — the vision of My presence; *na* *upajāyate* — does not fully develop; *tāvat* — for that long; *evam* — in this way; *upāsīta* — one must worship; *vāk* — of his speech; *manaḥ* — mind; *kāya* — and body; *vṛttibhiḥ* — by the functions.

### Translation

**Until one has fully developed the ability to see Me within all living beings, one must continue to worship Me by this process with the activities of his speech, mind and body.**

### Purport

Until one fully realizes the Supreme Lord within all beings, he should continue the process of offering obeisances to all creatures. Although one may not be able to actually fall on the ground before all creatures, at least within his mind or by his words one should offer respect to all living beings. This will accelerate the devotee’s self-realization.

### Translation

**My dear Uddhava, because I have personally established it, this process of devotional service unto Me is transcendental and free from any material motivation. Certainly a devotee never suffers even the slightest loss by adopting this process.**

### Purport

Although great sages and authorities have established various methods of human progress, the Supreme Lord Himself has introduced the system of *bhakti-yoga,* wherein one directly takes shelter of the Lord in loving service. One who serves the Lord without personal motivation can never be defeated in his progress and will certainly go back home, back to Godhead, in the near future.

### Verse text

*yo yo mayi pare dharmaḥ  
kalpyate niṣphalāya cet  
tad-āyāso nirarthaḥ syād  
bhayāder iva sattama*

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* *yaḥ* — whatever; *mayi* — unto Me; *pare* — the Supreme; *dharmaḥ* — is religion; *kalpyate* — tends; *niṣphalāya* — toward becoming free from the result of material work; *cet* — if; *tat* — of that; *āyāsaḥ* — the endeavor; *nirarthaḥ* — futile; *syāt* — may be; *bhaya*-*ādeḥ* — of fear and so on; *iva* — as; *sat*-*tama* — O best of saintly persons.

### Translation

**O Uddhava, greatest of saints, in a dangerous situation an ordinary person cries, becomes fearful and laments, although such useless emotions do not change the situation. But activities offered to Me without personal motivation, even if they are externally useless, amount to the actual process of religion.**

### Purport

Even the most insignificant activity, when offered to the Supreme Lord without personal desire, can elevate one to the perfection of spiritual life. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa always protects and maintains His devotee. But if a devotee cries to the Lord for protection or maintenance, desiring to continue his devotional service unimpeded, Lord Kṛṣṇa accepts such apparently unnecessary appeals to be the highest religious process.

### Translation

**This process is the supreme intelligence of the intelligent and the cleverness of the most clever, for by following it one can in this very life make use of the temporary and unreal to achieve Me, the eternal reality.**

### Purport

As described in this chapter, one who desires personal prestige in the Lord’s service cannot be considered intelligent and clever. Similarly, one who is anxious to become a sophisticated transcendental philosopher is not the most intelligent. Nor is one who is expert in accumulating money. The Lord here states that the most intelligent and clever person is the devotee who offers his temporary, illusory material body and possessions to Him with love and without personal motivation. The devotee thus obtains the eternal Absolute Truth. In other words, real intelligence is to actually surrender to Lord Kṛṣṇa, without personal desire or duplicity. That is the Lord’s opinion.

### Translation

**Thus have I related to you — both in brief and in detail — a complete survey of the science of the Absolute Truth. Even for the demigods, this science is very difficult to comprehend.**

### Purport

The word *devānām* indicates those living beings in the mode of goodness (such as demigods, saints and pious philosophers) who nevertheless cannot understand the Absolute Truth because they lack full surrender to the Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**My dear friend Uddhava, have you now completely understood this transcendental knowledge? Are the confusion and lamentation that arose in your mind now dispelled?**

### Purport

Śrī Uddhava had been bewildered by considering manifestations of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s own potency to be separate from Him. Uddhava’s lamentation arose because he thought himself separated from Lord Kṛṣṇa. Actually, Śrī Uddhava is an eternally liberated soul, but the Lord placed him in bewilderment and lamentation so that this supreme knowledge of the *Uddhava-gīta* could be spoken. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s question here indicates that if Uddhava had not perfectly understood this knowledge, Lord Kṛṣṇa would have explained the same thing again. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, since Śrī Uddhava is the intimate friend of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Lord’s question here was in a friendly, playful spirit. The Lord was well aware of Uddhava’s complete enlightenment in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

### Translation

**Through analytic knowledge, ritualistic work, mystic yoga, mundane business and political rule, people seek to advance in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. But because you are My devotee, whatever men can accomplish in these multifarious ways you will very easily find within Me.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the fear of separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa was continually entering the mind of Śrī Uddhava, and thus he tried to maintain his enthusiasm by remembering the Lord’s great kindness upon him. He steadied his mind with feelings of gratitude toward the Lord.

Although Śrī Uddhava feared separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, he now understands that in a fundamental sense the Lord is everything. Kṛṣṇa consciousness can never be threatened or diminished for one who has taken full shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.

### Verse text

dāśārha-vṛṣṇy-andhaka-sātvateṣu  
prasāritaḥ sṛṣṭi-vivṛddhaye tvayā

### Synonyms

*vṛkṇaḥ* — cut off; *ca* — and; *me* — my; *su*-*dṛḍhaḥ* — very firm; *sneha*-*pāśaḥ* — binding rope of affection; *dāśārha*-*vṛṣṇi*-*andhaka*-*sātvateṣu* — for the Dāśārhas, Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and Sātvatas; *prasāritaḥ* — cast; *sṛṣṭi* — of Your creation; *vivṛddhaye* — for the increase; *tvayā* — by You; *sva*-*māyayā* — through Your illusory energy; *hi* — indeed; *ātma* — of the soul; *su*-*bodha* — of proper knowledge; *hetinā* — by the sword.

### Translation

**The firmly binding rope of my affection for the families of the Dāśārhas, Vṛṣṇis, Andhakas and Sātvatas — a rope You originally cast over me by Your illusory energy for the purpose of developing Your creation — is now cut off by the weapon of transcendental knowledge of the self.**

### Purport

Although the members of the families mentioned in this verse are eternal associates of Lord Kṛṣṇa and thus proper objects of affection, Śrī Uddhava had regarded them as his personal relatives rather than simply as pure devotees of the Lord. Influenced by the Lord’s illusory potency, Uddhava had desired the prosperity and victory of these dynasties. But now, by hearing Lord Kṛṣṇa’s instructions, he has again fixed his mind exclusively upon Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus he regards his so-called family members without any mundane conception — as eternal servants of the Lord.

Purify yourself by both touching and also bathing in the holy waters there, which have emanated from My lotus feet. Rid yourself of all sinful reactions with the sight of the sacred Alakanandā River. Dress yourself in bark and eat whatever is naturally available in the forest. Thus you should remain content and free from desire, tolerant of all dualities, good-natured, self-controlled, peaceful and endowed with transcendental knowledge and realization. With fixed attention, meditate constantly upon these instructions I have imparted to you and assimilate their essence. Fix your words and thoughts upon Me, and always endeavor to increase your realization of My transcendental qualities. In this way you will cross beyond the destinations of the three modes of nature and finally come back to Me.**

According to the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.4.5), while Uddhava was enroute to Badarikāśrama he heard about the Lord’s journey to Prabhāsa. Turning back and following Lord Kṛṣṇa from behind, he saw the Lord alone just after the withdrawal of the Yadu dynasty. After being again mercifully instructed by the Personality of Godhead (along with Maitreya, who had just arrived), Uddhava felt his knowledge of the truth reawaken, and then, by the order of the Lord, he went on his way.

Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it.**

### Purport

Just as a bee extracts nectar from a flower without harming the flower, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa extracts the essence of all Vedic knowledge without disturbing the elaborate system of Vedic advancement. In other words, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa establishes Himself as the goal of Vedic knowledge without destroying preliminary, inferior processes that may be applicable to grossly materialistic men. Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī thus concludes by offering his obeisances to the spiritual master of the entire universe, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

*Thus end the purports of the humble servants of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda to the Eleventh Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Bhakti-yoga.”*
