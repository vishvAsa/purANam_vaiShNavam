In this chapter the brāhmaṇa Jaḍa Bharata instructs Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa in detail. He tells the King: “You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of your knowledge. Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement. Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of karma-kāṇḍa, material benefit. No one can spiritually advance by such activities. The conditioned soul is always overpowered by the modes of material nature, and consequently he is simply concerned with material benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things. In other words, the mind, which is the leader of the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life. Thus he continuously gets different types of bodies and suffers miserable material conditions. On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has been formulated. If one’s mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the material world. According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be transformed into hundreds and thousands. A person who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious is subjected to all these mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy. The living entity who is free from mental concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul, devoid of material contamination. There are two types of living entities: jīvātmā and Paramātmā, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. That Supreme Soul in His ultimate realization is Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. He enters into everyone’s heart and controls the living entity in his different activities. He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities. One can understand the Supreme Soul and one’s position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed from the unwanted association of ordinary men. In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of nescience. The cause of conditional life is attachment to the external energy. One has to conquer these mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties. Although mental concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable. No one should neglect to control the mind. If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position. Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and that service to Kṛṣṇa is his only business, one is doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses. One should kill mental concoctions by the sword of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee (guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja).”">

  <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
<p>In this chapter the <em>brāhmaṇa</em> Jaḍa Bharata instructs Mahārāja Rahūgaṇa in detail. He tells the King: “You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of your knowledge. Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement. Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of <em>karma-kāṇḍa,</em> material benefit. No one can spiritually advance by such activities. The conditioned soul is always overpowered by the modes of material nature, and consequently he is simply concerned with material benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things. In other words, the mind, which is the leader of the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life. Thus he continuously gets different types of bodies and suffers miserable material conditions. On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has been formulated. If one’s mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the material world. According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be transformed into hundreds and thousands. A person who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious is subjected to all these mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy. The living entity who is free from mental concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul, devoid of material contamination. There are two types of living entities: <em>jīvātmā</em> and <em>Paramātmā,</em> the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. That Supreme Soul in His ultimate realization is Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. He enters into everyone’s heart and controls the living entity in his different activities. He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities. One can understand the Supreme Soul and one’s position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed from the unwanted association of ordinary men. In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of nescience. The cause of conditional life is attachment to the external energy. One has to conquer these mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties. Although mental concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable. No one should neglect to control the mind. If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position. Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and that service to Kṛṣṇa is his only business, one is doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses. One should kill mental concoctions by the sword of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee (<em>guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</em>).”</p>

<h3 id="translation">Translation</h3>
<p><strong>The brāhmaṇa Jaḍa Bharata said: My dear King, although you are not at all experienced, you are trying to speak like a very experienced man. Consequently you cannot be considered an experienced person. An experienced person does not speak the way you are speaking about the relationship between a master and a servant or about material pains and pleasures. These are simply external activities. Any advanced, experienced man, considering the Absolute Truth, does not talk in this way.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purport">Purport</h3>
<p>Kṛṣṇa similarly chastised Arjuna. <em>Aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase:</em> “While speaking learned words, you are lamenting for what is not worthy of grief.” (Bg. 2.11) Similarly, among people in general, 99.9 percent try to talk like experienced advisers, but they are actually devoid of spiritual knowledge and are therefore like inexperienced children speaking nonsensically. Consequently their words cannot be given any importance. One has to learn from Kṛṣṇa or His devotee. If one speaks on the basis of this experience — that is, on the basis of spiritual knowledge — one’s words are valuable. At the present moment, the entire world is full of foolish people. <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> describes these people as <em>mūḍhas.</em> They are trying to rule human society, but because they are devoid of spiritual knowledge, the entire world is in a chaotic condition. To be released from these miserable conditions, one has to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and take lessons from an exalted personality like Jaḍa Bharata, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Kapiladeva. That is the only way to solve the problems of material life.</p>

<p><strong>My dear King, talks of the relationship between the master and the servant, the king and the subject and so forth are simply talks about material activities.

<h3 id="purport-1">Purport</h3>
<p>In this verse, two words are significant — <em>veda-vāda</em> and <em>tattva-vāda.</em> According to <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> those who are simply attached to the <em>Vedas</em> and who do not understand the purpose of the <em>Vedas</em> or the <em>Vedānta-sūtra</em> are called <em>veda-vāda-ratāḥ.</em></p>
<p><em>yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ<br>
pravadanty avipaścitaḥ<br>
veda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha<br>
nānyad astīti vādinaḥ</em></p>
<p><em>kāmātmānaḥ svarga-parā<br>
janma-karma-phala-pradām<br>
kriyā-viśeṣa-bahulāṁ<br>
bhogaiśvarya-gatiṁ prati</em></p>
<p>“Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the <em>Vedas,</em> which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power and so forth. Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say there is nothing more than this.” (<em>Bg</em>. 2.42-43)</p>
<p>The <em>veda-vāda</em> followers of the <em>Vedas</em> are generally inclined to <em>karma-kāṇḍa,</em> the performance of sacrifice according to the Vedic injunctions. They are thereby promoted to higher planetary systems. They generally practice the Cāturmāsya system. <em>Akṣayyaṁ ha vai cāturmāsya-yājinaḥ sukṛtaṁ bhavati:</em> one who performs the <em>cāturmāsya-yajña</em> becomes pious. By becoming pious, one may be promoted to the higher planetary systems (<em>ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ</em>). Some of the followers of the <em>Vedas</em> are attached to <em>karma-kāṇḍa,</em> the fruitive activities of the <em>Vedas,</em> in order to be promoted to a higher standard of life. Others argue that this is not the purpose of the <em>Vedas.</em> <em>Tad yathaiveha karma jitaḥ lokaḥ kṣīyate evam evam utra puṇya jitaḥ lokaḥ kṣīyate.</em> In this world someone may become very highly elevated by taking birth in an aristocratic family, by being well educated, beautiful or very rich. These are the gifts for pious activities enacted in the past life. However, these will be finished when the stock of pious activity is finished. If we become attached to pious activities, we may get these various worldly facilities in the next life and may take birth in the heavenly planets. But all this will eventually be finished. <em>Kṣīṇe puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti</em> (Bg. 9.21): when the stock of pious activity is finished, one again has to come to this <em>martya-loka.</em> According to the Vedic injunctions, the performance of pious activity is not really the objective of the <em>Vedas.</em> The objective of the <em>Vedas</em> is explained in <em>Bhagavad-gītā.</em> <em>Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:</em> the objective of the <em>Vedas</em> is to understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are <em>veda-vādīs</em> are not actually advanced in knowledge, and those who are followers of <em>jñāna-kāṇḍa</em> (Brahman understanding) are also not perfect. However, when one comes to the platform of <em>upāsanā</em> and accepts the worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes perfect (<em>ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param</em>). In the <em>Vedas</em> the worship of different demigods and the performance of sacrifice are certainly, mentioned, but such worship is inferior because the worshipers do not know that the ultimate goal is Viṣṇu (<em>na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum</em>). When one comes to the platform of <em>viṣṇor ārādhanam,</em> or <em>bhakti-yoga,</em> one has attained the perfection of life. Otherwise, as indicated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā,</em> one is not a <em>tattva-vādī</em> but a <em>veda-vādī, a</em> blind follower of the Vedic injunctions. A <em>veda-vādī</em> cannot be purified from material contamination unless he becomes a <em>tattva-vādī,</em> that is, one who knows <em>tattva,</em> the Absolute Truth. <em>Tattva</em> is also experienced in three features — <em>brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.</em> Even after coming to the platform of understanding <em>tattva,</em> one must worship Bhagavān, Viṣṇu and His expansions, or one is not yet perfect. <em>Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:</em> after many births, one who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. The conclusion is that unintelligent men with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand Bhagavān, Brahman or Paramātmā, but after studying the <em>Vedas</em> and attaining the understanding of the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is supposed to be on the platform of perfect knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="purport-2">Purport</h3>
<p>In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (2.45), Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to become transcendental to the material activities impelled by the three material modes of nature (<em>traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna</em>). The purpose of Vedic study is to transcend the activities of the three modes of material nature. Of course in the material world the mode of goodness is accepted as the best, and one can be promoted to the higher planetary systems by being on the <em>sattva-guṇa</em> platform. However, that is not perfection. One must come to the conclusion that even the <em>sattva-guṇa</em> platform is also not good. One may dream that he has become a king with a good family, wife and children, but immediately at the end of that dream he comes to the conclusion that it is false. Similarly, all kinds of material happiness are undesirable for a person who wants spiritual salvation. If a person does not come to the conclusion that he has nothing to do with any kind of material happiness, he cannot come to the platform of understanding the Absolute Truth, or <em>tattva jñāna.</em> <em>Karmīs, jñānīs</em> and <em>yogīs</em> are after some material elevation. The <em>karmīs</em> work hard day and night for some bodily comfort, and the <em>jñānīs</em> simply speculate about how to get out of the entanglement of <em>karma</em> and merge into the Brahman effulgence. The <em>yogīs</em> are very much addicted to the acquisition of material perfection and magical powers. All of them are trying to be materially perfect, but a devotee very easily comes to the platform of <em>nirguṇa</em> in devotional service, and consequently for the devotee the results of <em>karma, jñāna</em> and <em>yoga</em> become very insignificant. Therefore only the devotee is on the platform of <em>tattva jñāna,</em> not the others. Of course the <em>jñānī’s</em> position is better than that of the <em>karmī</em> but that position is also insufficient. The <em>jñānī</em> must actually become liberated, and after liberation he may be situated in devotional service (<em>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām</em>).</p>

<p>Transmigration among the 8,400,000 species is due to the mind’s being polluted by certain material qualities. Due to the mind, the soul is subjected to pious and impious activities.

<p>Mental activities under the influence of material nature cause happiness and distress within the material world. Being covered by illusion, the living entity eternally continues conditioned life under different designations. Such living entities are known as <em>nitya-baddha,</em> eternally conditioned.

If the mind is controlled, the senses are automatically controlled, and therefore the soul is saved from the reactions of pious and impious activity. If the mind is engaged at the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa (<em>sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ</em>), the senses are automatically engaged in the Lord’s service.

At the present moment, in our conditioned state, our mind is fully absorbed in material sense gratification, but it can be purified and brought to its original Kṛṣṇa consciousness by the process of devotional service. We have often given the example of Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. <em>Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</em> The mind must be controlled in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The tongue can be utilized to spread the message of Kṛṣṇa and glorify the Lord or take <em>prasāda,</em> the remnants of food offered to Kṛṣṇa. <em>Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau:</em> when one utilizes the tongue in the service of the Lord, the other senses can become purified. As stated in the <em>Nārada-pañcarātra, sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam:</em> when the mind and senses are purified, one’s total existence is purified, and one’s designations are also purified. One no longer considers himself a human being, a demigod, cat, dog, Hindu, Muslim and so forth. When the senses and mind are purified and one is fully engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service, one can be liberated and return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>The physical elements, nature, the original cause, culture, destiny and the time element are all material causes.

<h3 id="purport-10">Purport</h3>
<p>One should not think that all the interactions of the physical elements, gross and subtle, that cause the transformation of mind and consciousness are working independently. They are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.15), Kṛṣṇa says that the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart (<em>sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</em>). As mentioned herein, Supersoul (<em>kṣetrajña</em>) is directing everything. The living entity is also <em>kṣetrajña,</em> but the supreme <em>kṣetrajña</em> is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the witness and order giver. Under His direction, everything takes place. The different inclinations of the living entity are created by his own nature or his expectations, and he is trained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature. The body, nature and the physical elements are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They do not function automatically. Nature is neither independent nor automatic. As confirmed in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is behind nature.</p>

<h3 id="purport-11">Purport</h3>
<p>As stated in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (13.3), <em>kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</em> There are two kinds of <em>kṣetrajña,</em> or living beings. One is the individual living being, and the other is the supreme living being. The ordinary living being knows about his body to some extent, but the Supreme, Paramātmā, knows the condition of all bodies. The individual living being is localized, and the Supreme, Paramātmā, is all-pervading. In this <em>śloka</em> the word <em>kṣetrajña</em> refers to an ordinary living being, not the supreme living being. This ordinary living being is of two kinds — <em>nitya-baddha</em> or <em>nitya-mukta.</em> One is eternally conditioned and the other eternally liberated. The eternally liberated living beings are in the Vaikuṇṭha <em>jagat,</em> the spiritual world, and they never fall into the material world. Those in the material world are conditioned souls, <em>nitya-baddha.</em> The <em>nitya-baddhas</em> can become liberated by controlling the mind because the cause of conditioned life is the mind. When the mind is trained and the soul is not under the mind’s control, the soul can be liberated even in this material world. When it is liberated, one is called <em>jīvan-mukta.</em> A <em>jīvan-mukta</em> knows how he has become conditioned; therefore he tries to purify himself and return home, back to Godhead. The eternally conditioned soul is eternally conditioned because he is controlled by the mind. The conditioned state and liberated state are compared to the sleeping, unconscious state and the awakened state. Those who are sleeping and unconscious are eternally conditioned, but those who are awake understand that they are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore even in this material world, they engage in Kṛṣṇa’s service. As confirmed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī: <em>īhā yasya harer dāsye.</em> If one takes to Kṛṣṇa’s service, he is liberated, even though he appears to be a conditioned soul within the material world. <em>Jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate.</em> In any condition, one is to be considered liberated if his only business is to serve Kṛṣṇa.</p>

<p><strong>There are two kinds of kṣetrajña — the living entity, as explained above, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is explained as follows. He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with Lord Brahmā. He is called Nārāyaṇa, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is therefore known as Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings, moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.</strong></p>
<h3 id="purport-12">Purport</h3>
<p>This is confirmed in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> (15.15). <em>Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca.</em> Every living being is controlled by the supreme living being, Paramātmā, who resides within everyone’s heart. He is the <em>puruṣa,</em> the <em>puruṣa-avatāra,</em> who creates this material world. The first <em>puruṣa-avatāra</em> is Mahā-Viṣṇu, and that Mahā-Viṣṇu is the plenary portion of the plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa’s first expansion is Baladeva, and His next expansions are Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Vāsudeva is the original cause of the <em>brahmajyoti,</em> and the <em>brahmajyoti</em> is the expansion of the rays of the body of Vāsudeva.</p>

The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes.” (<em>Brahma-saṁhitā</em> 5.40) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus described in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>:</p>

<h3 id="purport-15">Purport</h3>
<p>There is one easy weapon with which the mind can be conquered — neglect. The mind is always telling us to do this or that; therefore we should be very expert in disobeying the mind’s orders. Gradually the mind should be trained to obey the orders of the soul. It is not that one should obey the orders of the mind. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to say that to control the mind one should beat it with shoes many times just after awakening and again before going to sleep. In this way one can control the mind. This is the instruction of all the <em>śāstras.</em> If one does not do so, one is doomed to follow the dictations of the mind. Another bona fide process is to abide strictly by the orders of the spiritual master and engage in the Lord’s service. Then the mind will be automatically controlled. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has instructed Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:</p>
<p><em>brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva<br>
guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</em></p>
<p>When one receives the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the <em>guru</em> and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one’s real life begins. If one abides by the orders of the spiritual master, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa he is freed from service to the mind.</p>
