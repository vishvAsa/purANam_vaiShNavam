CHAPTER FIFTEEN

In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Mahārāja and many other kings are described. The son of Mahārāja Bharata was named Sumati. He followed the path of liberation given by Ṛṣabhadeva. Some people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha. The son of Sumati was Devatājit, and his son was Devadyumna. Devadyumna’s son was Parameṣṭhī, and his son was Pratīha. Pratīha was a very great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, and he had three sons, named Pratihartā, Prastotā and Udgātā. Pratihartā had two sons, Aja and Bhūmā. The son of Bhūmā was Udgītha, and the son of Udgītha was Prastāva. The son of Prastāva was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was Pṛthuṣeṇa, whose son was Nakta. The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king. Actually King Gaya was a partial incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu, and because of his great devotion to Lord Viṣṇu he received the title Mahāpuruṣa. King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana. The son of Citraratha was the emperor Samrāṭ, and his son was Marīci, whose son was Bindu. Bindu’s son was Madhu, and Madhu’s son was Vīravrata. Vīravrata’s two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was Bhauvana. The son of Bhauvana was Tvaṣṭā, and the son of Tvaṣṭā was Viraja, who glorified the whole dynasty. Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter. Of these, the son named Śatajit became very famous.

### Synonyms

*śrī*-*śukaḥ* *uvāca* — Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued to speak; *bharatasya* — of Bharata Mahārāja; *ātma*-*jaḥ* — the son; *sumatiḥ* *nāma*-*abhihitaḥ* — named Sumati; *yam* — unto whom; *u* *ha* *vāva* — indeed; *kecit* — some; *pākhaṇḍinaḥ* — atheists, men without Vedic knowledge; *ṛṣabha*-*padavīm* — the path of King Ṛṣabhadeva; *anuvartamānam* — following; *ca* — and; *anāryāḥ* — not belonging to the Āryans who strictly follow the Vedic principles; *aveda*-*samāmnātām* — not enumerated in the *Vedas*; *devatām* — to be Lord Buddha or a similar Buddhist deity; *sva*-*manīṣayā* — by their own mental speculation; *pāpīyasyā* — most sinful; *kalau* — in this Age of Kali; *kalpayiṣyanti* — will imagine.

### Translation

**Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The son of Mahārāja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Ṛṣabhadeva, but in the Age of Kali some unscrupulous people will imagine him to be Lord Buddha himself. These people, who will actually be atheistic and of bad character, will interpret the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people will accept Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagate the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they will be carried away by mental concoction.**

### Purport

Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this Age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the Arya Samaj, who members are ignorant of the import of the *Vedas* in the *paramparā* system. They decry all bona fide *ācāryas* and pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles, but in fact such non-Āryans do not follow the Vedic principles. Another group of non-Āryans are the Jains, who are referred to in the present verse. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha, though they claim to. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they also claim to be descendants of Ṛṣabhadeva. Those who are Vaiṣṇavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the *Vedas.* In *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.15) Kṛṣṇa says, *vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:* “The real purpose of the *Vedas* is to understand Me.” This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot be accepted as an Āryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of *bhāgavata-dharma.* He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.

### Verse text

*ya ātma-vidyām ākhyāya svayaṁ saṁśuddho mahā-puruṣam anusasmāra.*

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* — who (King Pratīha); *ātma*-*vidyām* *ākhyāya* — after instructing many people about self-realization; *svayam* — personally; *saṁśuddhaḥ* — being very advanced and purified in self-realization; *mahā*-*puruṣam* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu; *anusasmāra* — perfectly understood and always remembered.

### Translation

**King Pratīha personally propagated the principles of self-realization. In this way, not only was he purified, but he became a great devotee of the Supreme Person, Lord Viṣṇu, and directly realized Him.**

### Purport

The word *anusasmāra* is very significant. God consciousness is not imaginary or concocted. The devotee who is pure and advanced realizes God as He is. Mahārāja Pratīha did so, and due to his direct realization of Lord Viṣṇu, he propagated self-realization and became a preacher. A real preacher cannot be bogus; he must first of all realize Lord Viṣṇu as He is. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.34), *upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ:* “One who has seen the truth can impart knowledge.” The word *tattva-darśī* refers to one who has perfectly realized the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a person can become a *guru* and propound Vaiṣṇava philosophy all over the world. The paragon of bona fide preachers and *gurus* is King Pratīha.

### Translation

**In the womb of his wife, Ṛṣikulyā, King Bhūmā begot a son named Udgītha. From Udgītha’s wife, Devakulyā, a son named Prastāva was born, and Prastāva begot a son named Vibhu through his wife, Niyutsā. In the womb of his wife, Ratī, Vibhu begot a son named Pṛthuṣeṇa. Pṛthuṣeṇa begot a son named Nakta in the womb of his wife, named Ākūti. Nakta’s wife was Druti, and from her womb the great King Gaya was born. Gaya was very famous and pious; he was the best of saintly kings. Lord Viṣṇu and His expansions, who are meant to protect the universe, are always situated in the transcendental mode of goodness, known as viśuddha-sattva. Being the direct expansion of Lord Viṣṇu, King Gaya was also situated in the viśuddha-sattva. Because of this, Mahārāja Gaya was fully equipped with transcendental knowledge. Therefore he was called Mahāpuruṣa.**

### Purport

From this verse it appears that the incarnations of God are various. Some are part and parcel of the direct expansions, and some are direct expansions of Lord Viṣṇu. A direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called *aṁśa* or *svāṁśa,* whereas an incarnation from *aṁśa* is called *kalā.* Among the *kalās* there are the *vibhinnāṁśa-jīvas,* or living entities. These are counted among the *jīva-tattvas.* Those who come directly from Lord Viṣṇu are called *viṣṇu-tattva* and are sometimes designated as Mahāpuruṣa. Another name for Kṛṣṇa is Mahāpuruṣa, and a devotee is sometimes called *mahā-pauruṣika.*

### Translation

**King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be disturbed by undesirable elements. He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens. \[This is called poṣaṇa.\] He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them. \[This is called prīṇana.\] He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words. \[This is called upalālana.\] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. \[This is called anuśāsana.\] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya’s royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called Mahāpuruṣa because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he anxious to rule the kingdom.**

### Purport

As Lord Kṛṣṇa states in *Bhagavad-gītā,* when He descends to the earth, He has two types of business — to give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (*paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām*). Since the king is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called *nara-deva,* that is, the Lord as a human being. According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on the material platform. As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would be jubilant. The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes. If the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful activities of the citizens. In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected to the influence of Kali-yuga. It is understood from the *Rāmāyaṇa* that when Bibhīṣaṇa became friends with Lord Rāmacandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord Rāmacandra, he would become a *brāhmaṇa* or a king in Kali-yuga. In this age, as Bibhīṣaṇa indicated, both *brāhmaṇas* and kings are in a wretched condition. Actually there are no kings or *brāhmaṇas* in this age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress. Compared to present standards, Mahārāja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Viṣṇu; therefore he was known as Mahāpuruṣa.

### Translation

**My dear King Parīkṣit, those who are learned scholars in the histories of the Purāṇas eulogize and glorify King Gaya with the following verses.**

### Purport

The historical references to exalted kings serve as a good example for present rulers. Those who are ruling the world at the present moment should take lessons from King Gaya, King Yudhiṣṭhira and King Pṛthu and rule the citizens so that they will be happy. Presently the governments are levying taxes without improving the citizens in any cultural, religious, social or political way. According to the *Vedas,* this is not recommended.

### Translation

**The great King Gaya used to perform all kinds of Vedic rituals. He was highly intelligent and expert in studying all the Vedic literatures. He maintained the religious principles and possessed all kinds of opulence. He was a leader among gentlemen and a servant of the devotees. He was a totally qualified plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore who could equal him in the performance of gigantic ritualistic ceremonies?**

### Translation

**All the chaste and honest daughters of Mahārāja Dakṣa, such as Śraddhā, Maitrī and Dayā, whose blessings were always effective, bathed Mahārāja Gaya with sanctified water. Indeed, they were very satisfied with Mahārāja Gaya. The planet earth personified came as a cow, and, as though she saw her calf, she delivered milk profusely when she saw all the good qualities of Mahārāja Gaya. In other words, Mahārāja Gaya was able to derive all benefits from the earth and thus satisfy the desires of his citizens. However, he personally had no desire.**

### Purport

The earth over which Mahārāja Gaya ruled is compared to a cow. The good qualities whereby he maintained and ruled the citizens are compared to the calf. A cow delivers milk in the presence of her calf; similarly the cow, or earth, fulfilled the desires of Mahārāja Gaya, who was able to utilize all the resources of the earth to benefit his citizens. This was possible because he was bathed in sanctified water by the honest daughters of Dakṣa. Unless a king or ruler is blessed by authorities, he cannot rule the citizens very satisfactorily. Through the good qualities of the ruler, the citizens become very happy and well qualified.

### Synonyms

*chandāṁsi* — all the different parts of the *Vedas*; *akāmasya* — of one who has no desire for personal sense gratification; *ca* — also; *yasya* — whose; *kāmān* — all desirables; *dudūhuḥ* — yielded; *ājahruḥ* — offered; *atho* — thus; *balim* — presentation; *nṛpāḥ* — all the kings; *pratyañcitāḥ* — being satisfied by his fighting in opposition; *yudhi* — in the war; *dharmeṇa* — by religious principles; *viprāḥ* — all the *brāhmaṇas*; *yadā* — when; *āśiṣām* — of blessings; *ṣaṣṭham* *aṁśam* — one sixth; *paretya* — in the next life.

### Translation

**Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Mahārāja Gaya had to fight were forced to fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, all the brāhmaṇas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya’s munificent charities. Consequently the brāhmaṇas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King Gaya’s benefit in the next life.**

### Purport

As a *kṣatriya* or emperor, Mahārāja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to him. Similarly, the *brāhmaṇas* who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the *brāhmaṇas* and *kṣatriyas* were all satisfied with Mahārāja Gaya because of his proper administration. In other words, Mahārāja Gaya satisfied the *kṣatriya* kings by his fighting and satisfied the *brāhmaṇas* by his charities. The *vaiśyas* were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Mahārāja Gaya’s constant sacrifices, the *śūdras* were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Mahārāja Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When *brāhmaṇas* and saintly persons are honored, they part with their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.34), *tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā:* one should try to approach a spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.

Also, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu \[the yajña-puruṣa\] also came and personally accepted all the sacrifices offered unto Him with pure and firm devotion in the sacrificial arena.**

### Purport

Mahārāja Gaya was so perfect that he satisfied all the demigods, who were headed by the heavenly King Indra. Lord Viṣṇu Himself also personally came to the sacrificial arena to accept the offerings. Although Mahārāja Gaya did not want them, he received all the blessings of the demigods and the Supreme Lord Himself.

### Translation

**When the Supreme Lord is pleased by a person’s actions, automatically all the demigods, human beings, animals, birds, bees, creepers, trees, grass and all other living entities, beginning with Lord Brahmā, are pleased. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supersoul of everyone, and He is by nature fully pleased. Nonetheless, He came to the arena of Mahārāja Gaya and said, “I am fully pleased.”**

### Purport

It is explicitly stated herein that simply by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one satisfies the demigods and all other living entities without differentiation. If one pours water on the root of a tree, all the branches, twigs, flowers and leaves are nourished. Although the Supreme Lord is self-satisfied, He was so pleased with the behavior of Mahārāja Gaya that He personally came to the sacrificial arena and said, “I am fully satisfied.” Who can compare to Mahārāja Gaya?

### Purport

Within a garden, a flowering tree attains a good reputation because of its fragrant flowers. Similarly, if there is a famous man in a family, he is compared to a fragrant flower in a forest. Because of him, an entire family can become famous in history. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa took birth in the Yadu dynasty, the Yadu dynasty and the Yādavas have remained famous for all time. Because of King Viraja’s appearance, the family of Mahārāja Priyavrata has remained famous for all time.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, entitled *“The Glories of the Descendants of King Priyavrata.”*
