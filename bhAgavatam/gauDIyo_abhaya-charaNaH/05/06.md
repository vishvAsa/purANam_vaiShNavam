CHAPTER SIX

This chapter tells how Lord Ṛṣabhadeva left His body. He was not attached to His body even when it was being burned up in a forest fire. When the seed of fruitive activity is burned by the fire of knowledge, the spiritual properties and mystic powers are automatically manifest, yet *bhakti-yoga* is not affected by these mystic powers. An ordinary *yogī* is captivated by mystic powers and his progress checked; therefore a perfect *yogī* does not welcome them. Because the mind is restless and undependable, it must remain always under control. Even the mind of the advanced *yogī* Saubhari created such a disturbance that he lost his yogic mystic powers. Due to a restless mind, even a very advanced *yogī* can fall down. The mind is so restless that it induces even a perfect *yogī* to be controlled by the senses. Therefore Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, for the instruction of all *yogīs,* showed the process of quitting the body. While traveling in South India, through the provinces of Karṇāṭa, Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva arrived in the neighborhood of Kuṭakācala. Suddenly there was a forest fire that burned the forest and Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s body to ashes. The pastimes of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as a liberated soul were known by the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka. This King’s name was Arhat. He later became captivated by the illusory energy, and in this condition he set forth the basic principles of Jainism. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva set forth the principles of religion that can free one from material bondage, and He put an end to all kinds of atheistic activities. On this earth, the place known as Bhārata-varṣa was a very pious land because the Supreme Lord appeared there when He wanted to incarnate.

Lord Ṛṣabhadeva neglected all the mystic powers for which the so-called *yogīs* hanker. Because of the beauty of devotional service, devotees are not at all interested in so-called mystic power. The master of all yogic power, Lord Kṛṣṇa, can exhibit all powers on behalf of His devotee. Devotional service is more valuable than yogic mystic powers. Devotees who are sometimes misled aspire for liberation and mystic powers. The Supreme Lord gives these devotees whatever they desire, but they cannot attain the most important function of devotional service. Devotional service to the Lord is guaranteed for those who do not desire liberation and mystic power.

ऋषिरुवाच  
सत्यमुक्तं किन्‍त्विह वा एके न मनसोऽद्धा विश्रम्भमनवस्थानस्य शठकिरात इव सङ्गच्छन्ते ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*rājovāca*  
*na nūnaṁ bhagava ātmārāmāṇāṁ yoga-samīrita-jñānāvabharjita-karma-bījānām aiśvaryāṇi punaḥ kleśadāni bhavitum arhanti yadṛc-chayopagatāni.*

### Synonyms

*rājā* *uvāca* — King Parīkṣit inquired; *na* — not; *nūnam* — indeed; *bhagavaḥ* — O most powerful Śukadeva Gosvāmī; *ātmārāmāṇām* — of pure devotees simply engaged in devotional service; *yoga*-*samīrita* — achieved by practice of *yoga*; *jñāna* — by knowledge; *avabharjita* — burned; *karma*-*bījānām* — of those whose seeds of fruitive activities; *aiśvaryāṇi* — the mystic powers; *punaḥ* — again; *kleśadāni* — sources of distress; *bhavitum* — to become; *arhanti* — are able; *yadṛcchayā* — automatically; *upagatāni* — achieved.

### Translation

**King Parīkṣit asked Śukadeva Gosvāmī: My dear Lord, for those who are completely pure in heart, knowledge is attained by the practice of bhakti-yoga, and attachment for fruitive activity is completely burned to ashes. For such people, the powers of mystic yoga automatically arise. They do not cause distress. Why, then, did Ṛṣabhadeva neglect them?**

### Purport

A pure devotee is constantly engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the result of mystic *yoga* power. Sometimes a *yogī* displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold. A little quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the *yogī* gets many followers, who are willing to accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a *yogī* may also advertise himself as Bhagavān. However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders. Without practicing the mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world. Under the circumstances, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit asked why He did not accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing. A devotee is never distressed or satisfied by material opulence. His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, by the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord’s service. He is not disturbed by the opulence.

ऋषिरुवाच  
सत्यमुक्तं किन्‍त्विह वा एके न मनसोऽद्धा विश्रम्भमनवस्थानस्य शठकिरात इव सङ्गच्छन्ते ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*ṛṣir uvāca*  
*satyam uktaṁ kintv iha vā eke na manaso ’ddhā viśrambham anavasthānasya śaṭha-kirāta iva saṅgacchante.*

### Synonyms

*ṛṣiḥ* *uvāca* — Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; *satyam* — the correct thing; *uktam* — have said; *kintu* — but; *iha* — in this material world; *vā* — either; *eke* — some; *na* — not; *manasaḥ* — of the mind; *addhā* — directly; *viśrambham* — faithful; *anavasthānasya* — being unsteady; *śaṭha* — very cunning; *kirātaḥ* — a hunter; *iva* — like; *saṅgacchante* — become.

### Translation

**Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied: My dear King, you have spoken correctly. However, after capturing animals, a cunning hunter does not put faith in them, for they might run away. Similarly, those who are advanced in spiritual life do not put faith in the mind. Indeed, they always remain vigilant and watch the mind’s action.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.5) Lord Kṛṣṇa says:

*yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma  
na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat  
yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva  
pāvanāni manīṣiṇām*

“Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.”

Even one who has renounced the world and has taken *sannyāsa* should not renounce chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra.* Renunciation does not mean that one has to renounce *saṅkīrtana-yajña.* Similarly, one should not renounce charity or *tapasya.* The *yoga* system for control of the mind and senses must be strictly followed. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva showed how severe types of *tapasya* could be performed, and He set an example for all others.

*na kuryāt karhicit sakhyaṁ

### Synonyms

*tathā* — so; *ca* — and; *uktam* — it is said; *na* — never; *kuryāt* — should do; *karhicit* — at any time or with anyone; *sakhyam* — friendship; *manasi* — in the mind; *hi* — certainly; *anavasthite* — which is very restless; *yat* — in which; *viśrambhāt* — from placing too much faith; *cirāt* — for a long time; *cīrṇam* — practiced; *caskanda* — became disturbed; *tapaḥ* — the austerity; *aiśvaram* — of great personalities like Lord Śiva and the great sage Saubhari.

### Translation

**All the learned scholars have given their opinion. The mind is by nature very restless, and one should not make friends with it. If we place full confidence in the mind, it may cheat us at any moment. Even Lord Śiva became agitated upon seeing the Mohinī form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Saubhari Muni also fell down from the mature stage of yogic perfection.**

### Purport

The first business of one trying to advance in spiritual life is to control the mind and senses. As Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (15.7):

*mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke  
jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ  
manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi  
prakṛti-sthāni karṣati*

Although the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and are therefore in a transcendental position, they are still suffering in this material world and struggling for existence due to the mind and the senses. To get out of this false struggle for existence and become happy in the material world, one has to control the mind and senses and be detached from material conditions. One should never neglect austerities and penances; one should always perform them. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva personally showed us how to do this. In the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (9.19.17) it is specifically stated:

*mātrā svasrā duhitrā vā  
nāviviktāsano bhavet  
balavān indriya-grāmo  
vidvāṁsam api karṣati*

A *gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsī* and *brahmacārī* should be very careful when associating with women. One is forbidden to sit down in a solitary place even with one’s mother, sister or daughter. In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement it has been very difficult to disassociate ourselves from women in our society, especially in Western countries. We are therefore sometimes criticized, but nonetheless we are trying to give everyone a chance to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* and thus advance spiritually. If we stick to the principle of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* offenselessly, then, by the grace of Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, we may be saved from the allurement of women. However, if we are not very strict in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra,* we may at any time fall victim to women.

### Devanagari

नित्यं ददाति कामस्यच्छिद्रं तमनु येऽरय- ।  
योगिन- कृतमैत्रस्य पत्युर्जायेव पुंश्चली ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*nityaṁ dadāti kāmasya  
cchidraṁ tam anu ye ’rayaḥ  
yoginaḥ kṛta-maitrasya  
patyur jāyeva puṁścalī*

### Synonyms

*nityam* — always; *dadāti* — gives; *kāmasya* — of lust; *chidram* — facility; *tam* — that (lust); *anu* — following; *ye* — those; *arayaḥ* — enemies; *yoginaḥ* — of the *yogīs* or persons trying to advance in spiritual life; *kṛta*-*maitrasya* — having put faith in the mind; *patyuḥ* — of the husband; *jāyā* *iva* — like the wife; *puṁścalī* — who is unchaste or easily carried away by other men.

### Translation

**An unchaste woman is very easily carried away by paramours, and it sometimes happens that her husband is violently killed by her paramours. If the yogī gives his mind a chance and does not restrain it, his mind will give facility to enemies like lust, anger and greed, and they will doubtlessly kill the yogī.**

### Purport

In this verse the word *puṁścalī* refers to a woman who is easily carried away by men. Such a woman is never to be trusted. Unfortunately, in the present age, women are never controlled. According to the directions of the *śāstras,* women are never to be given freedom. When a child, a woman must be strictly controlled by her father. When she is young, she must be strictly controlled by her husband, and when she is old, she must be controlled by her elderly sons. If she is given independence and allowed to mingle unrestrictedly with men, she will be spoiled. A spoiled woman, being manipulated by paramours, might even kill her husband. This example is given here because a *yogī* desiring to get free from material conditions must always keep his mind under control. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to say that in the morning our first business should be to beat the mind with shoes a hundred times, and, before going to bed, to beat the mind a hundred times with a broomstick. In this way one’s mind can be kept under control. An uncontrolled mind and an unchaste wife are the same. An unchaste wife can kill her husband at any time, and an uncontrolled mind, followed by lust, anger, greed, madness, envy and illusion, can certainly kill the *yogī.* When the *yogī* is controlled by the mind, he falls down into the material condition. One should be very careful of the mind, just as a husband should be careful of an unchaste wife.

*kāmo manyur mado lobhaḥ  
śoka-moha-bhayādayaḥ

### Synonyms

*kāmaḥ* — lust; *manyuḥ* — anger; *madaḥ* — pride; *lobhaḥ* — greed; *śoka* — lamentation; *moha* — illusion; *bhaya* — fear; *ādayaḥ* — all these together; *karma*-*bandhaḥ* — bondage to fruitive activities; *ca* — and; *yat*-*mūlaḥ* — the origin of which; *svīkuryāt* — would accept; *kaḥ* — who; *nu* — indeed; *tat* — that mind; *budhaḥ* — if one is learned.

### Translation

**The mind is the root cause of lust, anger, pride, greed, lamentation, illusion and fear. Combined, these constitute bondage to fruitive activity. What learned man would put faith in the mind?**

### Purport

The mind is the original cause of material bondage. It is followed by many enemies, such as anger, pride, greed, lamentation, illusion and fear. The best way to control the mind is to engage it always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (*sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ*). Since the followers of the mind bring about material bondage, we should be very careful not to trust the mind.

### Synonyms

*atha* — thereafter; *evam* — in this way; *akhila*-*loka*-*pāla*-*lalāmaḥ* — the head of all kings and monarchs of the universe; *api* — although; *vilakṣaṇaiḥ* — various; *jaḍa*-*vat* — as if stupid; *avadhūta*-*veṣa*-*bhāṣā*-*caritaiḥ* — by the dress, language and characteristics of an *avadhūta*; *avilakṣita*-*bhagavat*-*prabhāvaḥ* — hiding the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (keeping Himself like an ordinary human being); *yoginām* — of the *yogīs*; *sāmparāya*-*vidhim* — the method of giving up this material body; *anuśikṣayan* — teaching; *sva*-*kalevaram* — His own personal body, which is not at all material; *jihāsuḥ* — desiring to give up like an ordinary human being; *ātmani* — unto Vāsudeva, the original person; *ātmānam* — Himself, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, being an *āveśa-avatāra* of Lord Viṣṇu; *asaṁvyavahitam* — without intervention by the illusory energy; *anartha*-*antara*-*bhāvena* — Himself in the status of Viṣṇu; *anvīkṣamāṇaḥ* — always seeing; *uparata*-*anuvṛttiḥ* — who was acting as if giving up His material body; *upararāma* — ceased His pastimes as the King of this planet.

### Translation

**Lord Ṛṣabhadeva was the head of all kings and emperors within this universe, but assuming the dress and language of an avadhūta, He acted as if dull and materially bound. Consequently no one could observe His divine opulence. He adopted this behavior just to teach yogīs how to give up the body. Nonetheless, He maintained His original position as a plenary expansion of Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. Remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord Ṛṣabhadeva within the material world. If, following in the footsteps of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, one can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a material body again.**

### Purport

As Lord Kṛṣṇa says in *Bhagavad-gītā* (4.9):

*janma karma ca me divyam  
evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ  
tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma  
naiti mām eti so ’rjuna*

“One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.”

This is possible simply by keeping oneself an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. One must understand his constitutional position and the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord as well. Both have the same spiritual identity. Maintaining oneself as a servant of the Supreme Lord, one should avoid rebirth in this material world. If one keeps himself spiritually fit and thinks of himself as an eternal servant of the Supreme Lord, he will be successful at the time he has to give up the material body.

### Translation

**Actually Lord Ṛṣabhadeva had no material body, but due to yoga-māyā He considered His body material, and therefore, because He played like an ordinary human being, He gave up the mentality of identifying with it. Following this principle, He began to wander all over the world. While traveling, He came to the province of Karṇāṭa in South India and passed through Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka. He had no plan to travel this way, but He arrived near Kuṭakācala and entered a forest there. He placed stones within His mouth and began to wander through the forest, naked and with His hair disheveled like a madman.**

### Translation

**While He was wandering about, a wild forest fire began. This fire was caused by the friction of bamboos, which were being blown by the wind. In that fire, the entire forest near Kuṭakācala and the body of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva were burnt to ashes.**

### Purport

Such a forest fire can burn the external bodies of animals, but Lord Ṛṣabhadeva was not burned, although He apparently seemed so. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva is the Supersoul of all living entities within the forest, and His soul is never burned by fire. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *adāhyo ’yam* — the soul is never burned by fire. Due to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s presence, all the animals in the forest were also liberated from material encagement.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, the King of Koṅka, Veṅka and Kuṭaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Ṛṣabhadeva and, imitating Ṛṣabhadeva’s principles, introduced a new system of religion. Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity, King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles, which are free from risk, and concocted a new system of religion opposed to the Vedas. That was the beginning of the Jain dharma. Many other so-called religions followed this atheistic system.**

### Purport

When Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was present on this planet, a person named Pauṇḍraka imitated the four-handed Nārāyaṇa and declared himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He desired to compete with Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, during the time of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the King of Koṅka and Veṅka acted like a *paramahaṁsa* and imitated Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen condition of the people in this Age of Kali. It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic principles. The people in this age are described as *mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ.* Generally they have no spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. Following non-Vedic principles in this age, they think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world.

### Translation

**People who are lowest among men and bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord will give up the original varṇāśrama-dharma and its rules and regulations. They will abandon bathing three times daily and worshiping the Lord. Abandoning cleanliness and neglecting the Supreme Lord, they will accept nonsensical principles. Not regularly bathing or washing their mouths regularly, they will always remain unclean, and they will pluck out their hair. Following a concocted religion, they will flourish. During this Age of Kali, people are more inclined to irreligious systems. Consequently these people will naturally deride Vedic authority, the followers of Vedic authority, the brāhmaṇas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the devotees.**

### Purport

Presently the hippies in the Western countries fit this description. They are irresponsible and unregulated. They do not bathe, and they deride standard Vedic knowledge. They concoct new lifestyles and religions. There are many hippie groups at the present moment, but they all originated from King Arhat, who imitated the activities of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, who was situated on the *paramahaṁsa* stage. King Arhat did not care for the fact that although Lord Ṛṣabhadeva acted like a madman His stool and urine were nonetheless aromatic, so much so that they nicely scented the countryside for miles around. The followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains, and they were later followed by many others, particularly by the hippies, who are more or less offshoots of Māyāvāda philosophy because they think themselves the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such people do not respect the real followers of Vedic principles, the ideal *brāhmaṇas.* Nor do they have respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supreme Brahman. Due to the influence of this Age of Kali, they are apt to concoct false religious systems.

### Verse text

*ayam avatāro rajasopapluta-kaivalyopaśikṣaṇārthaḥ.*

### Synonyms

*ayam* *avatāraḥ* — this incarnation (Lord Ṛṣabhadeva); *rajasā* — by the mode of passion; *upapluta* — overwhelmed; *kaivalya*-*upaśikṣaṇa*-*arthaḥ* — to teach people the path of liberation.

### Translation

**In this Age of Kali, people are overwhelmed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva incarnated Himself to deliver them from the clutches of māyā.**

### Purport

The symptoms of Kali-yuga are predicted in the Twelfth Canto, Third Chapter, of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* *Lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam.* It is predicted how fallen souls will behave. They will keep their hair long and consider themselves very beautiful, or they will pluck out their hair as the Jains do. They will keep themselves unclean and will not wash their mouths. Jains refer to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva as their original preceptor. If such people are serious followers of Ṛṣabhadeva, they must also take His instructions. In the Fifth Chapter of this canto, Ṛṣabhadeva gave His one hundred sons instructions whereby they could become free from the clutches of *māyā.* If one actually follows Ṛṣabhadeva, he will certainly be delivered from the clutches of *māyā* and return home, back to Godhead. If one strictly follows the instructions of Ṛṣabhadeva given in the Fifth Chapter, he will certainly be liberated. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva incarnated specifically to deliver these fallen souls.

### Translation

**Learned scholars chant about the transcendental qualities of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva in this way: “Oh, this earthly planet contains seven seas and many islands and lands, of which Bhārata-varṣa is considered the most pious. People of Bhārata-varṣa are accustomed to glorifying the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnations as Lord Ṛṣabhadeva and others. All these activities are very auspicious for the welfare of humanity.**

### Purport

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said:

*bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra  
janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra*

As stated in this verse, Bhārata-varṣa is a most pious land. The followers of Vedic literature understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations, and they are privileged to glorify the Lord by following the directions of Vedic literature. After realizing the glories of human life, such people should take up the mission to spread the importance of human life throughout the whole world. This is the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The word *adhipuṇyam* indicates that there are certainly many other pious men throughout the world but the people of Bhārata-varṣa are even more pious. Therefore they are fit to spread Kṛṣṇa Consciousness throughout the world for the benefit of all human society. Śrīla Madhvācārya also recognizes the land of Bhārata-varṣa: *viśeṣād bhārate puṇyam.* Throughout the world, there is no question of *bhagavad-bhakti* or devotional service, but the people of Bhārata-varṣa can easily understand the devotional service of the Lord. Thus every inhabitant of Bhārata-varṣa can perfect his life by discharging *bhagavad-bhakti* and then preaching this cult throughout the world for the benefit of everyone.

### Purport

There are many dynasties in human society wherein the Supreme Lord descends as an incarnation. Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in the Yadu dynasty, and Lord Rāmacandra appeared in the Ikṣvāku, or Raghu, dynasty. Similarly, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva appeared in the dynasty of King Priyavrata. All these dynasties are very famous, and of them the dynasty of Priyavrata is most famous.

### Synonyms

*kaḥ* — who; *nu* — indeed; *asya* — of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva; *kāṣṭhām* — the example; *aparaḥ* — else; *anugacchet* — can follow; *manaḥ*-*rathena* — by the mind; *api* — even; *abhavasya* — of the unborn; *yogī* — the mystic; *yaḥ* — who; *yoga*-*māyāḥ* — the mystic perfections of *yoga*; *spṛhayati* — desires; *udastāḥ* — rejected by Ṛṣabhadeva; *hi* — certainly; *asattayā* — by the quality of being insubstantial; *yena* — by whom, Ṛṣabhadeva; *kṛta*-*prayatnāḥ* — although eager to serve.

### Translation

**“Who is that mystic yogī who can follow the examples of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva even with his mind? Lord Ṛṣabhadeva rejected all kinds of yogic perfection, which other yogīs hanker to attain. Who is that yogī who can compare to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva?”**

### Purport

Generally *yogīs* desire the yogic perfections of *aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prākāmya, prāpti, īśitva, vaśitva* and *kāmāvasāyitā.* Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, however, never aspired for all these material things. Such *siddhis* (perfections) are presented by the illusory energy of the Lord. The real purpose of the *yoga* system is to achieve the favor and shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but this purpose is covered by the illusory energy of *yoga-māyā.* So-called *yogīs* are therefore allured by the superficial material perfections of *aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti* and so forth. Consequently ordinary *yogīs* cannot compare to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: Lord Ṛṣabhadeva is the master of all Vedic knowledge, human beings, demigods, cows and brāhmaṇas. I have already explained His pure, transcendental activities, which will vanquish the sinful activities of all living entities. This narration of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s pastimes is the reservoir of all auspicious things. Whoever attentively hears or speaks of them, following in the footsteps of the ācāryas, will certainly attain unalloyed devotional service at the lotus feet of Lord Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

The teachings of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva are for the people of all *yugas* — Satya-yuga, Tretā-yuga, Dvāpara-yuga and especially Kali-yuga. These instructions are so powerful that even in this Age of Kali, one can attain perfection simply by explaining the instructions, following in the footsteps of the *ācāryas* or listening to the instructions with great attention. If one does so, one can attain the platform of pure devotional service to Lord Vāsudeva. The pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees are recorded in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* so that those who recite these pastimes and listen to them will become purified. *Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.* As a matter of principle, devotees should read, speak and hear *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* persistently, twenty-four hours daily if possible. That is the recommendation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. *Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.* One should either chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mahā-mantra* or read *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and thereby try to understand the characteristics and instructions of the Supreme Lord, who appeared as Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, Lord Kapila and Lord Kṛṣṇa. In this way one can become fully aware of the transcendental nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* one who knows the transcendental nature of the Lord’s birth and activities attains liberation from material bondage and returns to Godhead.

### Translation

**Devotees always bathe themselves in devotional service in order to be relieved from the various tribulations of material existence. By doing this, the devotees enjoy supreme bliss, and liberation personified comes to serve them. Nonetheless, they do not accept that service, even if it is offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. For the devotees, liberation \[mukti\] is very unimportant because, having attained the Lord’s transcendental loving service, they have attained everything desirable and have transcended all material desires.**

### Purport

Devotional service unto the Lord is the highest attainment for anyone desiring liberation from the tribulations of material existence. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.22), *yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ:* “Gaining this, one thinks there is no greater gain.” When one attains the service of the Lord, which is non-different from the Lord, one does not desire anything material. *Mukti* means relief from material existence. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura says: *muktiḥ mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate ’smān.* For a devotee, *mukti* is not a very great achievement. *Mukti* means being situated in one’s constitutional position. The constitutional position of every living being is that of the Lord’s servant; therefore when a living entity is engaged in the Lord’s loving service, he has already attained *mukti.* Consequently a devotee does not aspire for *mukti,* even if it is offered by the Supreme Lord Himself.

### Translation

**Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer of all the members of the Pāṇḍava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord’s favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to render direct service unto Him.**

### Purport

While instructing Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Śukadeva Gosvāmī thought it wise to encourage the King because the King might be thinking of the glorious position of various royal dynasties. Especially glorious is the dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord Ṛṣabhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of Uttānapāda Mahārāja, the father of Mahārāja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King Pṛthu’s taking birth in it. The dynasty of Mahārāja Raghu is glorified because Lord Rāmacandra appeared in that family. As far as the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Mahārāja Parīkṣit might have been thinking that the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that family, neither as Kṛṣṇa, Lord Rāmacandra, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva or Mahārāja Pṛthu. Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja was encouraged by Śukadeva Gosvāmī in this particular verse.

The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five Pāṇḍavas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord Kṛṣṇa did not appear in the Kuru dynasty, He was so obligated to the Pāṇḍavas’ devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the family and spiritual master of the Pāṇḍavas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kṛṣṇa was more affectionate to the Pāṇḍavas. By His actions, Lord Kṛṣṇa proved that He was more inclined to the Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed, Lord Kṛṣṇa, indebted to the Pāṇḍavas’ devotional service, sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit should not have been saddened because Lord Kṛṣṇa did not appear in his family. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees, and by His action it is clear that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa easily gives one liberation, but He does not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. *Muktiṁ dadāti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam.* Directly or indirectly, it is proved that *bhakti-yoga* is the basis for the supreme relationship with the Supreme Lord. It is far superior to liberation. For a pure devotee of the Lord, *mukti* is automatically attained.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, was fully aware of His true identity; therefore He was self-sufficient, and He did not desire external gratification. There was no need for Him to aspire for success, since He was complete in Himself. Those who unnecessarily engage in bodily conceptions and create an atmosphere of materialism are always ignorant of their real self-interest. Out of His causeless mercy, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva taught the self’s real identity and the goal of life. We therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who appeared as Lord Ṛṣabhadeva.**

### Purport

This is the summary of this chapter, in which the activities of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva are described. Being the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva is complete in Himself. We living entities, as parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, should follow the instructions of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva and become self-sufficient. We should not create unnecessary demands due to the bodily conception. When one is self-realized, he is sufficiently satisfied due to being situated in his original spiritual position. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54): *brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati.* This is the goal of all living entities. Even though one may be situated within this material world, he can become fully satisfied and devoid of hankering and lamentation simply by following the instructions of the Lord as set forth in *Bhagavad-gītā* or *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.* Satisfaction through self-realization is called *svarūpānanda.* The conditioned soul, eternally sleeping in darkness, does not understand his self-interest. He simply tries to become happy by making material adjustments, but this is impossible. It is therefore said in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum:* due to gross ignorance, the conditioned soul does not know that his real self-interest is to take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. To try to become happy by adjusting the material atmosphere is a useless endeavor. Indeed, it is impossible. By His personal behavior and instructions, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva enlightened the conditioned soul and showed him how to become self-sufficient in his spiritual identity.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “The Activities of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva.”*
