CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE

This chapter informs us of the movements of the sun. The sun is not stationary; it is also moving like the other planets. The sun’s movements determine the duration of night and day. When the sun travels north of the equator, it moves slowly during the day and very quickly at night, thus increasing the duration of the daytime and decreasing the duration of night. Similarly, when the sun travels south of the equator, the exact opposite is true — the duration of the day decreases, and the duration of night increases. When the sun enters Karkaṭa-rāśi (Cancer) and then travels to Siṁha-rāśi (Leo) and so on through Dhanuḥ-rāśi (Sagittarius), its course is called Dakṣiṇāyana, the southern way, and when the sun enters Makara-rāśi (Capricorn) and thereafter travels through Kumbharāśi (Aquarius) and so on through Mithuna-rāśi (Gemini), its course is called Uttarāyaṇa, the northern way. When the sun is in Meṣa-rāśi (Aries) and Tulā-rāśi (Libra), the duration of day and night are equal.

On Mānasottara Mountain are the abodes of four demigods. East of Sumeru Mountain is Devadhānī, where King Indra lives, and south of Sumeru is Saṁyamanī, the abode of Yamarāja, the superintendent of death. Similarly, west of Sumeru is Nimlocanī, the abode of Varuṇa, the demigod who controls the water, and north of Sumeru is Vibhāvarī, where the demigod of the moon lives. Sunrise, noon, sunset and midnight occur in all these places because of the movements of the sun. Diametrically opposite the place where the sunrise takes places and the sun is seen by human eyes, the sun will be setting and passing away from human vision. Similarly, the people residing diametrically opposite the point where it is midday will be experiencing midnight. The sun rises and sets with all the other planets, headed by the moon and other luminaries.

The entire *kāla-cakra,* or wheel of time, is established on the wheel of the sun-god’s chariot. This wheel is known as Saṁvatsara. The seven horses pulling the chariot of the sun are known as Gāyatrī, Bṛhatī, Uṣṇik, Jagatī, Triṣṭup, Anuṣṭup and Paṅkti. They are harnessed by a demigod known as Aruṇadeva to a yoke 900,000 *yojanas* wide. Thus the chariot carries Ādityadeva, the sun-god. Always staying in front of the sun-god and offering their prayers are sixty thousand sages known as Vālikhilyas. There are fourteen Gandharvas, Apsarās and other demigods, who are divided into seven parties and who perform ritualistic activities every month to worship the Supersoul through the sun-god according to different names. Thus the sun-god travels through the universe for a distance of 95,100,000 *yojanas* (760,800,000 miles) at a speed of 16,004 miles at every moment.

एतेन हि दिवो मण्डलमानं तद्विद उपदिशन्ति यथा द्विदलयोर्निष्पावादीनां ते अन्तरेणान्तरिक्षं तदुभयसन्धितम् ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*etena hi divo maṇḍala-mānaṁ tad-vida upadiśanti yathā dvi-dalayor niṣpāvādīnāṁ te antareṇāntarikṣaṁ tad-ubhaya-sandhitam.*

*etena* — by this estimation; *hi* — indeed; *divaḥ* — of the upper planetary system; *maṇḍala*-*mānam* — the measurement of the globe; *tat*-*vidaḥ* — the experts who know about it; *upadiśanti* — instruct; *yathā* — just as; *dvi*-*dalayoḥ* — in the two halves; *niṣpāva*-*ādīnām* — of grain such as wheat; *te* — of the two divisions; *antareṇa* — in the intervening space; *antarikṣam* — the sky or outer space; *tat* — by the two; *ubhaya* — on both sides; *sandhitam* — where the two parts join.

### Translation

**As a grain of wheat is divided into two parts and one can estimate the size of the upper part by knowing that of the lower, so, expert geographers instruct, one can understand the measurements of the upper part of the universe by knowing those of the lower part. The sky between the earthly sphere and heavenly sphere is called antarikṣa, or outer space. It adjoins the top of the sphere of earth and the bottom of that of heaven.**

### Translation

By the influence of its radiation, the sun heats the universe and maintains its proper order. It also gives light to help all living entities see. While passing toward the north, toward the south or through the equator, in accordance with the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is said to move slowly, swiftly or moderately. According to its movements in rising above, going beneath or passing through the equator — and correspondingly coming in touch with various signs of the zodiac, headed by Makara \[Capricorn\] — days and nights are short, long or equal to one another.**

### Purport

Lord Brahmā prays in his *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.52):

*yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ  
rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ  
yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time. The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light.” Although the sun is described as *bhagavān,* the most powerful, and although it is actually the most powerful planet within the universe, it nevertheless has to carry out the order of Govinda, Kṛṣṇa. The sun-god cannot deviate even an inch from the orbit designated to him. Therefore in every sphere of life, the supreme order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is carried out. The entire material nature carries out His orders. However, we foolishly see the activities of material nature without understanding the supreme order and Supreme Person behind them. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā,* *mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ:* material nature carries out the orders of the Lord, and thus everything is maintained in an orderly way.

### Synonyms

*tatratyānām* — for the living entities residing on Mount Meru; *divasa*-*madhyaṅgataḥ* — being positioned as at midday; *eva* — indeed; *sadā* — always; *ādityaḥ* — the sun; *tapati* — heats; *savyena* — to the left side; *acalam* — Sumeru Mountain; *dakṣiṇena* — to the right (being forced by wind blowing to the right, the sun moves to the right); *karoti* — moves; *yatra* — the point where; *udeti* — it rises; *tasya* — of that position; *ha* — certainly; *samāna*-*sūtra*-*nipāte* — at the diametrically opposite point; *nimlocati* — the sun sets; *yatra* — where; *kvacana* — somewhere; *syandena* — with perspiration; *abhitapati* — heats (at midday); *tasya* — of that; *ha* — certainly; *eṣaḥ* — this (the sun); *samāna*-*sūtra*-*nipāte* — at the diametrically opposite point; *prasvāpayati* — the sun causes to sleep (as at midnight); *tatra* — there; *gatam* — gone; *na* *paśyanti* — do not see; *ye* — who; *tam* — the sunset; *samanupaśyeran* — seeing.

### Translation

**The living entities residing on Sumeru Mountain are always very warm, as at midday, because for them the sun is always overhead. Although the sun moves counterclockwise, facing the constellations, with Sumeru Mountain on its left, it also moves clockwise and appears to have the mountain on its right because it is influenced by the dakṣiṇāvarta wind. People living in countries at points diametrically opposite to where the sun is first seen rising will see the sun setting, and if a straight line were drawn from a point where the sun is at midday, the people in countries at the opposite end of the line would be experiencing midnight. Similarly, if people residing where the sun is setting were to go to countries diametrically opposite, they would not see the sun in the same condition.**

### Purport

The distance indicated by the word *sādhikāni* is *pañca-viṁśati-sahasrādhikāni,* or 25,000 *yojanas.* That plus two and a half crores and twelve and a half *lakṣa* of *yojanas* is the distance the sun travels between each two cities. This comes to 23,775,000 *yojanas,* or 190,200,000 miles. The total orbit of the sun is four times that distance, or 95,100,000 *yojanas* (760,800,000 miles).

### Synonyms

*evam* — in this way; *tataḥ* — from there; *vāruṇīm* — to the quarters where Varuṇa lives; *saumyām* — to the quarters where the moon lives; *aindrīṁ* *ca* — and to the quarters where Indra lives; *punaḥ* — again; *tathā* — so also; *anye* — the others; *ca* — also; *grahāḥ* — planets; *soma*-*ādayaḥ* — headed by the moon; *nakṣatraiḥ* — all the stars; *saha* — with; *jyotiḥ*-*cakre* — in the celestial sphere; *samabhyudyanti* — rise; *saha* — along with; *vā* — or; *nimlocanti* — set.

### Translation

**From the residence of Yamarāja the sun travels to Nimlocanī, the residence of Varuṇa, from there to Vibhāvarī, the residence of the moon-god, and from there again to the residence of Indra. In a similar way, the moon, along with the other stars and planets, becomes visible in the celestial sphere and then sets and again becomes invisible.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* (10.21) Kṛṣṇa says, *nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī:* “Of stars I am the moon.” This indicates that the moon is similar to the other stars. The Vedic literature informs us that within this universe there is one sun, which is moving. The Western theory that all the luminaries in the sky are different suns is not confirmed in the Vedic literature. Nor can we assume that these luminaries are the suns of other universes, for each universe is covered by various layers of material elements, and therefore although the universes are clustered together, we cannot see from one universe to another. In other words, whatever we see is within this one universe. In each universe there is one Lord Brahmā, and there are other demigods on other planets, but there is only one sun.

The twelve months are calculated to be its twelve spokes, the six seasons are the sections of its rim, and the three cātur-māsya periods are its three-sectioned hub. One side of the axle carrying the wheel rests upon the summit of Mount Sumeru, and the other rests upon Mānasottara Mountain. Affixed to the outer end of the axle, the wheel continuously rotates on Mānasottara Mountain like the wheel of an oil-pressing machine.**
