### Translation

**O brāhmaṇa, authorities on the matter understand a Purāṇa to contain ten characteristic topics: the creation of this universe, the subsequent creation of worlds and beings, the maintenance of all living beings, their sustenance, the rule of various Manus, the dynasties of great kings, the activities of such kings, annihilation, motivation and the supreme shelter. Other scholars state that the great Purāṇas deal with these ten topics, while lesser Purāṇas may deal with five.**

### Purport

The ten subjects of a great *Purāṇa* are also described in the Second Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (2.10.1):

śrī-śuka uvāca  
*atra sargo visargaś ca  
sthānaṁ poṣaṇam ūtayaḥ  
manvantareśānukathā  
nirodho muktir āśrayaḥ*

“Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: In the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* there are ten divisions of statements regarding the following: the creation of the universe, subcreation, planetary systems, protection by the Lord, the creative impetus, the change of Manus, the science of God, returning home (back to Godhead), liberation and the *summum bonum.*”

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, *Purāṇas* such as *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* deal with these ten topics, whereas lesser *Purāṇas* deal with only five. As stated in Vedic literature:

*sargaś ca pratisargaś ca  
vaṁśo manvantarāṇi ca  
vaṁśānucaritaṁ ceti  
purāṇaṁ pañca-lakṣaṇam*

“Creation, secondary creation, the dynasties of kings, the reigns of Manus and the activities of various dynasties are the five characteristics of a *Purāṇa.*” *Purāṇas* covering five categories of knowledge are understood to be secondary Purāṇic literature.

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained that the ten principal topics of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* are found within each of the twelve cantos. One should not try to assign each of the ten topics to a particular canto. Nor should the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* be artificially interpreted to show that it deals with the topics successively. The simple fact is that all aspects of knowledge important to human beings, summarized in the ten categories mentioned above, are described with various degrees of emphasis and analysis throughout the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

### Purport

Just as a seed grows into a tree that produces thousands of new seeds, material desire develops into fruitive activity that stimulates thousands of new desires within the heart of the conditioned soul. The word *puruṣānugṛhītānām* indicates that by the mercy of the Supreme Lord one is allowed to desire and act in this world.

Such action may be carried out either in pursuit of selfish desire or in accordance with the law of God.**

### Translation

**Out of ignorance the living being performs material activities and thereby becomes in one sense the cause of the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe. Some authorities call the living being the personality underlying the material creation, while others say he is the unmanifest self.**

### Purport

The Supreme Lord Himself creates, maintains and annihilates the cosmos. However, such activities are performed in response to the desires of conditioned souls, who are described herein as *hetu,* or the cause of cosmic activity. The Lord creates this world to facilitate the conditioned soul’s attempt to exploit nature and ultimately to facilitate his self-realization.

Since conditioned souls cannot perceive their own constitutional identity, they are described here as *avyākṛtam,* or unmanifest. In other words, the living entity cannot perceive his real form unless he is completely Kṛṣṇa conscious.

### Translation

**The Supreme Absolute Truth is present throughout all the stages of awareness — waking consciousness, sleep and deep sleep — throughout all the phenomena manifested by the illusory energy, and within the functions of all living entities, and He also exists separate from all these. Thus situated in His own transcendence, He is the ultimate and unique shelter.**

### Purport

Moist clay can be molded into various shapes and named “waterpot,” “flowerpot” or “storage pot.” Despite the various names and forms, the essential ingredient, earth, is constantly present. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is present throughout a material body’s stages of bodily existence. The Lord is identical with material nature, being its ultimate generating source. At the same time, the unique Supreme Being exists separately, aloof in His own abode.

### Purport

As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (3.25.33), *jarayaty āśu yā kośaṁ nigīrṇam analo yathā:* “*Bhakti,* devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the living entity without separate endeavor, just as fire in the stomach digests all that we eat.” The subtle material body is inclined to exploit nature through sex, greed, false pride and madness. Loving service to the Lord, however, dissolves the stubborn false ego and lifts one to pure blissful consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the sublime perfection of existence.
