CHAPTER SIX

This chapter describes Mahārāja Parīkṣit’s attainment of liberation, Mahārāja Janamejaya’s performance of sacrifice for killing all snakes, the origin of the *Vedas,* and Śrīla Vedavyāsa’s dividing of the Vedic literature.

After hearing the words of Śrī Śukadeva, Mahārāja Parīkṣit stated that by having listened to the *Bhāgavatam,* which is the compendium of the *Purāṇas* and which is full of the nectarean pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Uttamaḥśloka, Parīkṣit had attained the transcendental position of fearlessness and oneness with the Supreme. His ignorance had been dispelled, and by the mercy of Śrī Śukadeva he had gained sight of the supremely auspicious personal form of God, namely the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Hari. As a result, he had cast aside all fear of death. Śrī Parīkṣit Mahārāja then begged Śukadeva Gosvāmī to permit him to fix his heart upon the lotus feet of Lord Hari and give up his life. Granting this permission, Śrī Śukadeva rose and departed. Subsequently Mahārāja Parīkṣit, free of all doubts, sat down in yogic posture and merged himself in meditation upon the Supersoul. Then the snake-bird Takṣaka, arriving in the disguise of a *brāhmaṇa,* bit him, and the body of the saintly king immediately burned to ashes.

Janamejaya, the son of Parīkṣit, became very angry when he received news of his father’s death, and he began a sacrificial performance for the purpose of destroying all the snakes. Even though Takṣaka received protection from Indra, he nevertheless became attracted by the *mantras* and was about to fall into the fire. Seeing this, Bṛhaspati, the son of Aṅgirā Ṛṣi, came and advised Mahārāja Janamejaya that Takṣaka could not be killed because he had drunk the nectar of the demigods. Furthermore, Bṛhaspati said that all living entities must enjoy the fruits of their past activities. Therefore the king should give up this sacrifice. Janamejaya was thus convinced by the words of Bṛhaspati and stopped his sacrifice.

Thereafter Sūta Gosvāmī, in response to questions from Śrī Śaunaka, described the divisions of the *Vedas.* From the heart of the topmost demigod, Brahmā, came the subtle transcendental vibration, and from this subtle sound vibration arose the syllable *om,* greatly potent and self-luminous. Using this *oṁkāra,* Lord Brahmā created the original *Vedas* and taught them to his sons, Marīci and others, who were all saintly leaders of the *brāhmaṇa* community. This body of Vedic knowledge was handed down through the disciplic succession of spiritual masters until the end of Dvāpara-yuga, when Lord Vyāsadeva divided it into four parts and instructed various schools of sages in these four *saṁhitās.* When the sage Yājñavalkya was rejected by his spiritual master, he had to give up all the Vedic *mantras* he had received from him. To obtain new *mantras* of the *Yajur Veda,* Yājñavalkya worshiped the Supreme Lord in the form of the sun-god. Śrī Sūryadeva subsequently fulfilled his prayer.

### Verse text

sūta uvāca  
*etan niśamya muninābhihitaṁ parīkṣid  
vyāsātmajena nikhilātma-dṛśā samena  
tat-pāda-mūlam upasṛtya natena mūrdhnā  
baddhāñjalis tam idam āha sa viṣṇurātaḥ*

### Synonyms

*sūtaḥ* *uvāca* — Sūta Gosvāmī said; *etat* — this; *niśamya* — hearing; *muninā* — by the sage (Śukadeva); *abhihitam* — narrated; *parīkṣit* — Mahārāja Parīkṣit; *vyāsa*-*ātma*-*jena* — by the son of Vyāsadeva; *nikhila* — of all living beings; *ātma* — the Supreme Lord; *dṛśā* — who sees; *samena* — who is perfectly equipoised; *tat* — of him (Śukadeva); *pāda*-*mūlam* — to the lotus feet; *upasṛtya* — going up; *natena* — bowed down; *mūrdhnā* — with his head; *baddha*-*añjaliḥ* — his arms folded in supplication; *tam* — to him; *idam* — this; *āha* — said; *saḥ* — he; *viṣṇu*-*rātaḥ* — Parīkṣit, who while still in the womb had been protected by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself.

### Translation

**Sūta Gosvāmī said: After hearing all that was narrated to him by the self-realized and equipoised Śukadeva, the son of Vyāsadeva, Mahārāja Parīkṣit humbly approached his lotus feet. Bowing his head down upon the sage’s feet, the King, who had lived his entire life under the protection of Lord Viṣṇu, folded his hands in supplication and spoke as follows.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, some of the sages present while Śukadeva was instructing King Parīkṣit were impersonalist philosophers. Thus the word *samena* indicates that in the previous chapter Śukadeva Gosvāmī had spoken the philosophy of self-realization in a way pleasing to such intellectual *yogīs.*

### Translation

**This is indeed the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu’s illusory energy, which is unstoppable and difficult to perceive. Although the individual spirit souls are part and parcel of the Lord, through the influence of this illusory energy they are bewildered by their identification with various material bodies.**

### Purport

The illusory energy of Lord Viṣṇu is so powerful that even the illustrious son of King Parīkṣit was temporarily misdirected. Because he was a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, his bewilderment was quickly rectified. On the other hand, an ordinary, materialistic person without the special protection of the Lord plummets to the depths of material ignorance. Factually, materialistic persons are not interested in the protection of Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore their complete ruination is inevitable.

### Translation

**But there exists a supreme reality, in which the illusory energy cannot fearlessly dominate, thinking, “I can control this person because he is deceitful.” In that highest reality there are no illusory argumentative philosophies. Rather, there the true students of spiritual science constantly engage in authorized spiritual investigation. In that supreme reality there is no manifestation of the material mind, which functions in terms of alternating decision and doubt. Created material products, their subtle causes and the goals of enjoyment attained by their utilization do not exist there. Furthermore, in that supreme reality there is no conditioned spirit, covered by false ego and the three modes of nature. That reality excludes everything limited or limiting. One who is wise should therefore stop the waves of material life and enjoy within that Supreme Truth.**

### Purport

The illusory energy of the Lord, Māyā, can freely exert her influence over those who are hypocritical, deceitful and disobedient to the laws of God. Since the Personality of Godhead is free of all material qualities, Māyā herself becomes fearful in His presence. As stated by Lord Brahmā (*vilajjamānayā yasya sthātum īkṣa-pate ’muyā*): “Māyā herself is ashamed to stand face to face with the Supreme Lord.”

In the supreme spiritual reality, useless academic wrangling is completely absent. As stated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (6.4.31):

*yac-chaktayo vadatāṁ vādināṁ vai  
vivāda-saṁvāda-bhuvo bhavanti  
kurvanti caiṣāṁ muhur ātma-mohaṁ  
tasmai namo ’nanta-guṇāya bhūmne*

“Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.”

### Synonyms

*param* — the supreme; *padam* — situation; *vaiṣṇavam* — of Lord Viṣṇu; *āmananti* — they designate; *tat* — that; *yat* — which; *na* *iti* *na* *iti* — “not this, not this”; *iti* — thus analyzing; *atat* — everything extraneous; *utsisṛkṣavaḥ* — those who are desirous of giving up; *visṛjya* — rejecting; *daurātmyam* — petty materialism; *ananya* — placing nowhere else; *sauhṛdāḥ* — their affection; *hṛdā* — within their hearts; *upaguhya* — embracing Him; *avasitam* — who is captured; *samāhitaiḥ* — by those who meditate upon Him in trance.

### Translation

**Those who desire to give up all that is not essentially real move systematically, by negative discrimination of the extraneous, to the supreme position of Lord Viṣṇu. Giving up petty materialism, they offer their love exclusively to the Absolute Truth within their hearts and embrace that highest truth in fixed meditation.**

### Purport

The words *yan neti netīty atad-utsisṛkṣavaḥ* indicate the process of negative discrimination, by which one engaged in the search for essential and absolute truth systematically rejects all that is superfluous, superficial and relative. Throughout the world people have gradually rejected the ultimate validity of political, social and even religious truths, but because they lack Kṛṣṇa consciousness they remain bewildered and cynical. However, as clearly stated here, *paraṁ padaṁ vaiṣṇavam āmananti tat.* Those who actually desire perfect knowledge must not only reject the nonessential but must also ultimately understand the essential spiritual reality called *paraṁ padaṁ vaiṣṇavam:* the supreme destination, the abode of Lord Viṣṇu. *Padam* indicates both the status and the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which can be understood only by those who give up petty materialism and adopt the position of *ananya-sauhṛdam,* exclusive love for the Lord. Such exclusive love is not narrow-minded or sectarian, because all living entities, being within the Lord, are automatically served when one directly serves the supreme entity. This process of rendering the highest service to the Lord and to all living entities constitutes the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is taught throughout *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*

### Translation

**Such devotees come to understand the supreme transcendental situation of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu, because they are no longer polluted by the concepts of “I” and “my,” which are based on body and home.**

It is the direct designation of the self-originating Absolute Truth, the Supersoul, and is the secret essence and eternal seed of all Vedic hymns.**

### Purport

The senses of a sleeping person do not function until he has awakened. Therefore, when a sleeping person is awakened by a noise, one may ask, “Who heard the noise?” The words *supta-śrotre* in this verse indicate that the Supreme Lord within the heart hears the sound and awakens the sleeping living entities. The Lord’s sensory activities always function on a superior level. Ultimately, all sounds vibrate within the sky, and in the internal region of the heart there is a type of sky meant for the vibration of Vedic sounds. The seed, or source, of all Vedic sounds is the *oṁkāra.* This is confirmed by the Vedic statement *om ity etad brahmaṇo nediṣṭhaṁ nāma.* The full elaboration of the Vedic seed sound is *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the greatest Vedic literature.

According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, it is improper for a *brāhmaṇa* to collect what has been vomited, and so the powerful *brāhmaṇa* disciples of Vaiśampāyana assumed the form of *tittiras,* partridges, and collected the valuable *mantras.*

Just as the sky is present both inside and outside every living being, you exist both within the hearts of all as the Supersoul and externally in the form of time. Just as the sky cannot be covered by the clouds present within it, you are never covered by any false material designation. By the flow of years, which are made up of the tiny fragments of time called kṣaṇas, lavas and nimeṣas, you alone maintain this world, drying up the waters and giving them back as rain.**

### Purport

This prayer is not offered to the sun-god as an independent or autonomous entity but rather to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, represented by His powerful expansion the solar deity.

### Purport

According to Vedic culture, the three higher classes of society (the intellectual, political and mercantile sections) are formally connected with the spiritual master by initiation and receive the Gāyatrī *mantra.* This purifying *mantra* is chanted three times daily — at sunrise, noon and sunset. Auspicious moments for the performance of spiritual duties are calculated according to the sun’s path in the sky, and this systematic scheduling of spiritual duties is here attributed to the sun as the representative of God.
