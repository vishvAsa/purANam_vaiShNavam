+++
CHAPTER ELEVEN

In the context of worship, this chapter describes the Mahāpuruṣa and the various expansions of the sun in each month. Śrī Sūta first tells Śaunaka Ṛṣi about the material objects through which one can understand the major limbs, the secondary limbs, the weapons and the garments of Lord Śrī Hari. Then he outlines the process of practical service by which a mortal soul can attain immortality. When Śaunaka shows further interest in learning about the expansion of Lord Hari in the form of the sun-god, Sūta replies that Lord Śrī Hari *—* the indwelling controller of the universe and its original creator *—* manifests Himself in the form of the demigod of the sun. Sages describe this sun-god in many features according to his different material designations. To sustain the world, the Personality of Godhead manifests His potency of time as the sun and travels throughout the twelve months, beginning with Caitra, along with twelve sets of personal associates. One who remembers the opulences of the Personality of Godhead Śrī Hari in His form as the sun will become free of his sinful reactions.

### Translation

**The goddess of fortune, Śrī, who never leaves the Lord’s side, appears with Him in this world as the representation of His internal potency. Viṣvaksena, the chief among His personal associates, is known to be the personification of the Pañcarātra and other tantras. And the Lord’s eight doorkeepers, headed by Nanda, are His mystic perfections, beginning with aṇimā.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the goddess of fortune is the original source of all material opulence. Material nature is directly controlled by the Lord’s inferior energy, Mahā-māyā, whereas the goddess of fortune is His internal, superior energy. Still, the opulence of the Lord’s inferior nature has its source in the supreme spiritual opulence of the goddess of fortune. As stated in *Śrī Hayaśīrṣa Pañcarātra:*

*paramātmā harir devas  
tac-chaktiḥ śrīr ihoditā  
śrīr devī prakṛtiḥ proktā  
keśavaḥ puruṣaḥ smṛtaḥ  
na viṣṇunā vinā devī  
na hariḥ padmajāṁ vinā*

“The Supreme Soul is Lord Hari, and His potency is known in this world as Śrī. Goddess Śrī is known as *prakṛti,* and the Supreme Lord Keśava is known as the *puruṣa.* The divine goddess is never present without Him, nor does He ever appear without her.”

Also, *Śrī Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (1.8.15) states:

*nityaiva sā jagan-mātā  
viṣṇoḥ śrīr anapāyinī  
yathā sarva-gato viṣṇus  
tathaiveyaṁ dvijottamāḥ*

“She is the eternal mother of the universe, the goddess of fortune of Lord Viṣṇu, and she is never separated from Him. In the same way that Lord Viṣṇu is present everywhere, so is she, O best of *brāhmaṇas.”*

Also in *Viṣṇu Purāṇa* (1.9.140):

*evaṁ yathā jagat-svāmī  
deva-devo janārdanaḥ  
avatāraṁ karoty eva  
tathā śrīs tat-sahāyinī*

“Thus, in the same way that the Lord of the universe, the God of gods, Janārdana, descends to this world, so His consort, the goddess of fortune, does also.”

The pure spiritual status of the goddess of fortune is described in the *Skanda Purāṇa:*

*aparaṁ tv akṣaraṁ yā sā  
prakṛtir jaḍa-rūpikā  
śrīḥ parā prakṛtiḥ proktā  
cetanā viṣṇu-saṁśrayā*

*taṁ akṣaraṁ paraṁ prāhuḥ  
parataḥ param akṣaram  
harir evākhila-guṇo ’py  
akṣara-trayam īritam*

“The inferior infallible entity is that nature who manifests as the material world. The goddess of fortune, on the other hand, is known as the superior nature. She is pure consciousness and is under the direct shelter of Lord Viṣṇu. While she is said to be the superior infallible entity, that infallible entity who is greater than the greatest is Lord Hari Himself, the original possessor of all transcendental qualities. In this way, three distinct infallible entities are described.”

Thus, although the inferior energy of the Lord is infallible in her function, her power to manifest temporary illusory opulences exists by the grace of the internal energy, the goddess of fortune, who is the personal consort of the Supreme Lord.

The *Padma Purāṇa* (256.9-21) lists eighteen doorkeepers of the Lord: Nanda, Sunanda, Jaya, Vijaya, Caṇḍa, Pracaṇḍa, Bhadra, Subhadra, Dhātā, Vidhātā, Kumuda, Kumudākṣa, Pundarīkṣa, Vāmana, Śaṅkukarṇa, Sarvanetra, Sumukha and Supratiṣṭhita.

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura recommends that we become humble by practicing the following meditation: “The earth, which is always visible to me, is the expansion of the lotus feet of my Lord, who is always to be meditated upon. All moving and nonmoving living beings have taken shelter of the earth and are thus sheltered at the lotus feet of my Lord. For this reason I should respect every living being and not envy anyone. In fact, all living entities constitute the Kaustubha gem on My Lord’s chest. Therefore I should never envy or deride any living entity.” By practicing this meditation one can achieve success in life.

After hearing an account of the exalted conversation between Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Śaunaka now inquires about the sun as the expansion of the Supreme Lord.

In each of the twelve months beginning from Vaiśākha there are different names for the sun-god himself, the sage, the Yakṣa, the Gandharva, the Apsarā, the Rākṣasa and the Nāga, making a total of seven categories.
