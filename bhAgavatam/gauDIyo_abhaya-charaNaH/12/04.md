+++
CHAPTER FOUR

This chapter discusses the four kinds of annihilation (constant, occasional, material and final) and the chanting of the holy name of Lord Hari, which is the only means of stopping the cycle of material life.

One thousand cycles of four ages constitute one day of Brahmā, and each day of Brahmā, called a *kalpa,* contains within it the lifetimes of fourteen Manus. The duration of Brahmā’s night is the same as that of his day. During his night Brahmā sleeps, and the three planetary systems meet destruction; this is the *naimittika,* or occasional, annihilation. When Brahmā’s life span of one hundred years is finished, there occurs the *prākṛtika,* or total material, annihilation. At that time the seven elements of material nature, beginning with the *mahat,* and the entire universal egg composed of them are destroyed. When a person achieves knowledge of the Absolute, he understands factual reality. He perceives the entire created universe as separate from the Absolute and therefore unreal. That is called the *ātyantika,* or final, annihilation (liberation). At every moment time invisibly transforms the bodies of all created beings and all other manifestations of matter. This process of transformation causes the living entity to undergo the constant annihilation of birth and death. Those possessed of subtle vision state that all creatures, including Brahmā himself, are always subject to generation and annihilation. Material life means subjugation to birth and death, or generation and annihilation. The only boat suitable for crossing the ocean of material existence, which is otherwise impossible to cross, is the boat of submissive hearing of the nectarean pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Purport

It is significant that Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the spiritual master of King Parīkṣit, is broadly discussing cosmic annihilation just before the death of his disciple. By attentively hearing the story of universal destruction, one can easily understand one’s personal departure from this temporary world to be an insignificant incident within the gigantic scope of the total material manifestation. By his deep and relevant discussions of the creation of God, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, as an ideal spiritual master, is preparing his disciple for the moment of death.

### Verse text

### Purport

As clearly explained throughout *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* the first element, sky, possesses the unique quality of sound. As creation expands, the second element, air, comes into being, and it possesses sound and touch. The third element, fire, possesses sound, touch and form, and the fourth element, water, possesses sound, touch, form and flavor. The earth possesses sound, touch, form, flavor and aroma. As each element loses its unique distinguishing quality, it naturally becomes indistinguishable from the more subtle elements and is thus effectively dissolved as a unique entity.

### Translation

**The element fire then seizes the taste from the element water, which, deprived of its unique quality, taste, merges into fire. Air seizes the form inherent in fire, and then fire, deprived of form, merges into air. The element ether seizes the quality of air, namely touch, and that air enters into ether. Then, O King, false ego in ignorance seizes sound, the quality of ether, after which ether merges into false ego. False ego in the mode of passion takes hold of the senses, and false ego in the mode of goodness absorbs the demigods. Then the total mahat-tattva seizes false ego along with its various functions, and that mahat is seized by the three basic modes of nature — goodness, passion and ignorance. My dear King Parīkṣit, these modes are further overtaken by the original unmanifest form of nature, impelled by time. That unmanifest nature is not subject to the six kinds of transformation caused by the influence of time. Rather, it has no beginning and no end. It is the unmanifest, eternal and infallible cause of creation.**

### Translation

**In the unmanifest stage of material nature, called pradhāna, there is no expression of words, no mind and no manifestation of the subtle elements beginning from the mahat, nor are there the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. There is no life air or intelligence, nor any senses or demigods. There is no definite arrangement of planetary systems, nor are there present the different stages of consciousness — sleep, wakefulness and deep sleep. There is no ether, water, earth, air, fire or sun. The situation is just like that of complete sleep, or of voidness. Indeed, it is indescribable. Authorities in spiritual science explain, however, that since pradhāna is the original substance, it is the actual basis of material creation.**

### Translation

**This is the annihilation called prākṛtika, during which the energies belonging to the Supreme Person and His unmanifest material nature, disassembled by the force of time, are deprived of their potencies and merge together totally.**

jñānaṁ bhāti tad-āśrayam  
dṛśyatvāvyatirekābhyām  
ādy-antavad avastu yat*

### Synonyms

*buddhi* — of intelligence; *indriya* — the senses; *artha* — and the objects of perception; *rūpeṇa* — in the form; *jñānam* — the Absolute Truth; *bhāti* — manifests; *tat* — of these elements; *āśrayam* — the basis; *dṛśyatva* — because of being perceived; *avyatirekābhyām* — and because of being nondifferent from its own cause; *ādi*-*anta*-*vat* — which has a beginning and an end; *avastu* — is insubstantial; *yat* — whatever.

### Translation

**It is the Absolute Truth alone who manifests in the forms of intelligence, the senses and the objects of sense perception, and who is their ultimate basis. Whatever has a beginning and an end is insubstantial because of being an object perceived by limited senses and because of being nondifferent from its own cause.**

### Purport

The word *dṛśyatva* indicates that all subtle and gross material manifestations are made visible by the potency of the Supreme Lord and again become invisible, or unmanifest, at the time of annihilation. They are therefore in essence not separate from the source of their expansion and withdrawal.

*dīpaḥ* — a lamp; *cakṣuḥ* — a perceiving eye; *ca* — and; *rūpam* — a perceived form; *ca* — and; *jyotiṣaḥ* — from the original element fire; *na* — not; *pṛthak* — distinct; *bhavet* — are; *evam* — in the same way; *dhīḥ* — intelligence; *khāni* — the senses; *mātrāḥ* — the perceptions; *ca* — and; *na* *syuḥ* — they are not; *anyatamāt* — which is itself completely distinct; *ṛtāt* — from the reality.

### Translation

**A lamp, the eye that views by the light of that lamp, and the visible form that is viewed are all basically nondifferent from the element fire. In the same way, intelligence, the senses and sense perceptions have no existence separate from the supreme reality, although that Absolute Truth remains totally distinct from them.**

बुद्धेर्जागरणं स्वप्न- सुषुप्तिरिति चोच्यते ।

### Verse text

*buddher jāgaraṇaṁ svapnaḥ  
suṣuptir iti cocyate  
māyā-mātram idaṁ rājan  
nānātvaṁ pratyag-ātmani*

### Synonyms

*buddheḥ* — of intelligence; *jāgaraṇam* — waking consciousness; *svapnaḥ* — sleep; *suṣuptiḥ* — deep sleep; *iti* — thus; *ca* — and; *ucyate* — are called; *māyā*-*mātram* — merely illusion; *idam* — this; *rājan* — O King; *nānātvam* — the duality; *pratyak*-*ātmani* — experienced by the pure soul.

### Translation

**The three states of intelligence are called waking consciousness, sleep and deep sleep. But, my dear King, the variegated experiences created for the pure living entity by these different states are nothing more than illusion.**

### Purport

Pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness exists beyond the various stages of material awareness. Just as darkness vanishes in the presence of light, so illusory material intelligence, which is experienced as normal perception, dreaming and deep sleep, completely vanishes in the brilliant presence of pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the constitutional condition of every living entity.

### Translation

**Just as clouds in the sky come into being and are then dispersed by the amalgamation and dissolution of their constituent elements, this material universe is created and destroyed within the Absolute Truth by the amalgamation and dissolution of its elemental, constituent parts.**

### Synonyms

*satyam* — real; *hi* — because; *avayavaḥ* — the ingredient cause; *proktaḥ* — is said to be; *sarva*-*avayavinām* — of all constituted entities; *iha* — in this created world; *vinā* — apart from; *arthena* — their manifest product; *pratīyeran* — they can be perceived; *paṭasya* — of a cloth; *iva* — as; *aṅga* — my dear King; *tantavaḥ* — the threads.

### Translation

**My dear King, it is stated \[in the Vedānta-sūtra\] that the ingredient cause that constitutes any manifested product in this universe can be perceived as a separate reality, just as the threads that make up a cloth can be perceived separately from their product.**

*yat sāmānya-viśeṣābhyām  
upalabhyeta sa bhramaḥ  
anyonyāpāśrayāt sarvam  
ādy-antavad avastu yat*

### Synonyms

*yat* — whatever; *sāmānya* — in terms of general cause; *viśeṣābhyām* — and specific product; *upalabhyeta* — is experienced; *saḥ* — that; *bhramaḥ* — is illusion; *anyonya* — mutual; *apāśrayāt* — because of dependence; *sarvam* — everything; *ādi*-*anta*-*vat* — subject to beginning and end; *avastu* — unreal; *yat* — which.

### Translation

**Anything experienced in terms of general cause and specific effect must be an illusion, because such causes and effects exist only relative to each other. Indeed, whatever has a beginning and an end is unreal.**

### Purport

The nature of a material cause cannot be perceived without perception of the effect. For example, the burning nature of fire cannot be perceived without observing the effect of fire, such as a burning object or ashes. Similarly, the saturating quality of water cannot be understood without observing the effect, a saturated cloth or paper. The organizational power of a man cannot be understood without observing the effect of his dynamic work, namely a solid institution. In this way, not only do effects depend upon their causes, but the perception of the cause also depends upon observation of the effect. Thus both are defined relatively and have a beginning and an end. The conclusion is that all such material causes and effects are essentially temporary and relative, and consequently illusory.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, although the cause of all causes, has no beginning or end. Therefore He is neither material nor illusory. Lord Kṛṣṇa’s opulences and potencies are absolute reality, beyond the interdependence of material cause and effect.

*vikāraḥ khyāyamāno ’pi  
pratyag-ātmānam antarā  
na nirūpyo ’sty aṇur api  
syāc cec cit-sama ātma-vat*

### Synonyms

*vikāraḥ* — the transformation of created existence; *khyāyamānaḥ* — appearing; *api* — although; *pratyak*-*ātmānam* — the Supreme Soul; *antarā* — without; *na* — not; *nirūpyaḥ* — conceivable; *asti* — is; *aṇuḥ* — a single atom; *api* — even; *syāt* — it is so; *cet* — if; *cit*-*samaḥ* — equally spirit; *ātma*-*vat* — remaining as it is, without change.

### Translation

**Although perceived, the transformation of even a single atom of material nature has no ultimate definition without reference to the Supreme Soul. To be accepted as factually existing, something must possess the same quality as pure spirit — eternal, unchanging existence.**

### Purport

A mirage of water appearing in the desert is actually a manifestation of light; the false appearance of water is a specific transformation of light. That which falsely appears as independent material nature is similarly a transformation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Material nature is the external potency of the Lord.

न हि सत्यस्य नानात्वमविद्वान् यदि मन्यते ।

### Verse text

*na hi satyasya nānātvam  
avidvān yadi manyate

jyotiṣor vātayor iva*

### Synonyms

*na* — there is no; *hi* — indeed; *satyasya* — of the Absolute Truth; *nānātvam* — duality; *avidvān* — a person not in true knowledge; *yadi* — if; *manyate* — he thinks; *nānātvam* — the duality; *chidrayoḥ* — of the two skies; *yadvat* — just as; *jyotiṣoḥ* — of the two celestial lights; *vātayoḥ* — of the two winds; *iva* — as.

### Translation

**There is no material duality in the Absolute Truth. The duality perceived by an ignorant person is like the difference between the sky contained in an empty pot and the sky outside the pot, or the difference between the reflection of the sun in water and the sun itself in the sky, or the difference between the vital air within one living body and that within another body.**

### Translation

**According to their different purposes, men utilize gold in various ways, and gold is therefore perceived in various forms. In the same way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inaccessible to material senses, is described in various terms, both ordinary and Vedic, by different types of men.**

### Purport

All those who are not pure devotees of the Supreme Lord are basically trying to exploit the Lord and His energies. According to their strategy of exploitation, they conceive of and describe the Absolute Truth in various ways. In *Bhagavad-gītā* and *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* the Absolute Truth presents Himself as He actually is for the benefit of sincere people who do not foolishly try to conceptually manipulate the Supreme Godhead.

### Synonyms

*yathā* — as; *ghanaḥ* — a cloud; *arka* — of the sun; *prabhavaḥ* — the product; *arka* — by the sun; *darśitaḥ* — made visible; *hi* — indeed; *arka* — of the sun; *aṁśa*-*bhūtasya* — which is the partial expansion; *ca* — and; *cakṣuṣaḥ* — of the eye; *tamaḥ* — darkness; *evam* — in the same way; *tu* — indeed; *aham* — false ego; *brahma*-*guṇaḥ* — a quality of the Absolute Truth; *tat*-*īkṣitaḥ* — visible through the agency of that Absolute Truth; *brahma*-*aṁśakasya* — of the partial expansion of the Absolute Truth; *ātmanaḥ* — of the *jīva* soul; *ātma*-*bandhanaḥ* — serving to obstruct perception of the Supreme Soul.

### Translation

**Although a cloud is a product of the sun and is also made visible by the sun, it nevertheless creates darkness for the viewing eye, which is another partial expansion of the sun. Similarly, material false ego, a particular product of the Absolute Truth made visible by the Absolute Truth, obstructs the individual soul, another partial expansion of the Absolute Truth, from realizing the Absolute Truth.**

### Translation

**When the cloud originally produced from the sun is torn apart, the eye can see the actual form of the sun. Similarly, when the spirit soul destroys his material covering of false ego by inquiring into the transcendental science, he regains his original spiritual awareness.**

### Purport

Just as the sun can burn away the clouds that prevent one from seeing it, the Supreme Lord (and He alone) can remove the false ego that prevents one from seeing Him. There are some creatures, however, like owls, who are averse to seeing the sun. In the same way, those who are not interested in spiritual knowledge will never receive the privilege of seeing God.

### Translation

**My dear Parīkṣit, when the illusory false ego that binds the soul has been cut off with the sword of discriminating knowledge and one has developed realization of Lord Acyuta, the Supreme Soul, this is called the ātyantika, or ultimate, annihilation of material existence.**

### Translation

**These stages of existence created by beginningless and endless time, the impersonal representative of the Supreme Lord, are not visible, just as the infinitesimal momentary changes of position of the planets in the sky cannot be directly seen.**

### Purport

Although everyone knows that the sun is constantly moving in the sky, one cannot normally see the sun moving. Similarly, no one can directly perceive his hair or nails growing, although with the passing of time we perceive the fact of growth. Time, the potency of the Lord, is very subtle and powerful and is an insurmountable barrier to fools who are trying to exploit the material creation.

**For a person who is suffering in the fire of countless miseries and who desires to cross the insurmountable ocean of material existence, there is no suitable boat except that of cultivating devotion to the transcendental taste for the narrations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s pastimes.**

### Purport

Although it is not possible to completely describe the pastimes of the Lord, even a partial appreciation can save one from the unbearable miseries of material existence. The fever of material existence can be removed only by the medicine of the holy name and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, which are perfectly narrated in *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.*
