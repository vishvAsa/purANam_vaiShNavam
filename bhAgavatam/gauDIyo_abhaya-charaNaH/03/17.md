### Devanagari

मैत्रेय उवाच  
निशम्यात्मभुवा गीतं कारणं शङ्कयोज्झिता- ।  
तत- सर्वे न्यवर्तन्त त्रिदिवाय दिवौकस- ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

maitreya uvāca  
*niśamyātma-bhuvā gītaṁ  
kāraṇaṁ śaṅkayojjhitāḥ  
tataḥ sarve nyavartanta  
tridivāya divaukasaḥ*

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* — the sage Maitreya; *uvāca* — said; *niśamya* — upon hearing; *ātma*-*bhuvā* — by Brahmā; *gītam* — explanation; *kāraṇam* — the cause; *śaṅkayā* — from fear; *ujjhitāḥ* — freed; *tataḥ* — then; *sarve* — all; *nyavartanta* — returned; *tri*-*divāya* — to the heavenly planets; *diva*-*okasaḥ* — the demigods (who inhabit the higher planets).

### Translation

**Śrī Maitreya said: The demigods, the inhabitants of the higher planets, were freed from all fear upon hearing the cause of the darkness explained by Brahmā, who was born from Viṣṇu. Thus they all returned to their respective planets.**

### Purport

The demigods, who are denizens of higher planets, are also very much afraid of incidents such as the universe’s becoming dark, and so they consulted Brahmā. This indicates that the quality of fear exists for every living entity in the material world. The four principal activities of material existence are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. The fear element exists also in the demigods. On every planet, even in the higher planetary systems, including the moon and the sun, as well as on this earth, the same principles of animal life exist. Otherwise, why are the demigods also afraid of the darkness? The difference between the demigods and ordinary human beings is that the demigods approach authority, whereas the inhabitants of this earth defy authority. If people would only approach the authority, then every adverse condition in this universe could be rectified. Arjuna was also disturbed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, but he approached the authority, Kṛṣṇa, and his problem was solved. The conclusive instruction of this incident is that we may be disturbed by some material condition, but if we approach the authority who can actually explain the matter, then our problem is solved. The demigods approached Brahmā for the meaning of the disturbance, and after hearing from him they were satisfied and returned home peacefully.

### Purport

When natural disturbances occur on a planet, one should understand that a demon must have taken birth there. In the present age the number of demoniac people is increasing; therefore natural disturbances are also increasing. There is no doubt about this, as we can understand from the statements of the *Bhāgavatam.*

उन्मूलयन्नगपतीन्वात्यानीको रजोध्वज- ॥ ५ ॥

### Translation

**There blew winds which were most uninviting to the touch, hissing again and again and uprooting gigantic trees. They had storms for their armies and clouds of dust for their ensigns.**

### Purport

When there are natural disturbances like blowing cyclones, too much heat or snowfall, and uprooting of trees by hurricanes, it is to be understood that the demoniac population is increasing and so the natural disturbance is also taking place. There are many countries on the globe, even at the present moment, where all these disturbances are current. This is true all over the world. There is insufficient sunshine, and there are always clouds in the sky, snowfall and severe cold. These assure that such places are inhabited by demoniac people who are accustomed to all kinds of forbidden, sinful activity.

### Purport

The entire universe is moving under the three modes of material nature. Those living entities who are in goodness are called the pious species — pious lands, pious trees, etc. It is similar with the planets also; many planets are considered pious, and others are considered impious. Saturn and Mars are considered impious. When the pious planets shine very brightly, it is an auspicious sign, but when the inauspicious planets shine very brightly, this is not a very good sign.

### Translation

**Marking these and many other omens of evil times, everyone but the four sage sons of Brahmā, who were aware of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya and of their birth as Diti’s sons, was seized with fear. They did not know the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe was at hand.**

### Purport

According to *Bhagavad-gītā,* Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so stringent that it is impossible for the living entity to surpass their enforcement. It is also explained that only those who are fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be saved. We can learn from the description of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* that it is because of the birth of two great demons that there were so many natural disturbances. It is to be indirectly understood, as previously described, that when there are constant disturbances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been born or that the demoniac population has increased. In former days there were only two demons — those born of Diti — yet there were so many disturbances. At the present day, especially in this Age of Kali, these disturbances are always visible, which indicates that the demoniac population has certainly increased.

To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization enacted so many rules and regulations of social life, the most important of which is the *garbhādhāna* process for begetting good children. In *Bhagavad-gītā* Arjuna informed Kṛṣṇa that if there is unwanted population (*varṇa-saṅkara*), the entire world will appear to be hell. People are very anxious for peace in the world, but there are so many unwanted children born without the benefit of the *garbhādhāna* ceremony, just like the demons born from Diti. Diti was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a time which was inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to create disturbances. In having sex life to beget children, one should observe the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not demons, and automatically there is peace in the world. If we do not follow regulations in life for social tranquillity, we cannot expect peace. Rather, we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws.

तावादिदैत्यौ सहसा व्यज्यमानात्मपौरुषौ ।

### Verse text

*tāv ādi-daityau sahasā  
vyajyamānātma-pauruṣau  
vavṛdhāte ’śma-sāreṇa  
kāyenādri-patī iva*

### Synonyms

*tau* — those two; *ādi*-*daityau* — demons in the beginning of creation; *sahasā* — quickly; *vyajyamāna* — being manifest; *ātma* — own; *pauruṣau* — prowess; *vavṛdhāte* — grew; *aśma*-*sāreṇa* — steel-like; *kāyena* — with bodily frames; *adri*-*patī* — two great mountains; *iva* — like.

### Translation

**These two demons who appeared in ancient times soon began to exhibit uncommon bodily features; they had steel-like frames which began to grow just like two great mountains.**

### Purport

There are two classes of men in the world: one is called the demon, and the other is called the demigod. The demigods concern themselves with the spiritual upliftment of human society, whereas the demons are concerned with physical and material upliftment. The two demons born of Diti began to make their bodies as strong as iron frames, and they were so tall that they seemed to touch outer space. They were decorated with valuable ornaments, and they thought that this was success in life. Originally it was planned that Jaya and Vijaya, the two doorkeepers of Vaikuṇṭha, were to take birth in this material world, where, by the curse of the sages, they were to play the part of always being angry with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As demoniac persons, they became so angry that they were not concerned with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but simply with physical comforts and physical upliftment.

### Translation

**Their bodies became so tall that they seemed to kiss the sky with the crests of their gold crowns. They blocked the view of all directions and while walking shook the earth at every step. Their arms were adorned with brilliant bracelets, and they stood as if covering the sun with their waists, which were bound with excellent and beautiful girdles.**

### Purport

In the demoniac way of civilization, people are interested in getting a body constructed in such a way that when they walk on the street the earth will tremble and when they stand it will appear that they cover the sun and the vision of the four directions. If a race appears strong in body, their country is materially considered to be among the highly advanced nations of the world.

### Synonyms

*prajāpatiḥ* — Kaśyapa; *nāma* — names; *tayoḥ* — of the two; *akārṣīt* — gave; *yaḥ* — who; *prāk* — first; *sva*-*dehāt* — from his body; *yamayoḥ* — of the twins; *ajāyata* — was delivered; *tam* — him; *vai* — indeed; *hiraṇyakaśipum* — Hiraṇyakaśipu; *viduḥ* — know; *prajāḥ* — people; *yam* — whom; *tam* — him; *hiraṇyākṣam* — Hiraṇyākṣa; *asūta* — gave birth to; *sā* — she (Diti); *agrataḥ* — first.

### Translation

**Prajāpati Kaśyapa, the creator of the living entities, gave his twin sons their names; the one who was born first he named Hiraṇyākṣa, and the one who was first conceived by Diti he named Hiraṇyakaśipu.**

### Purport

There is an authoritative Vedic literature called *Piṇḍa-siddhi* in which the scientific understanding of pregnancy is very nicely described. It is stated that when the male secretion enters the menstrual flux in the uterus in two successive drops, the mother develops two embryos in her womb, and she brings forth twins in a reverse order to that in which they were first conceived; the child conceived first is born later, and the one conceived later is brought forth first. The first child conceived in the womb lives behind the second child, so when birth takes place the second child appears first, and the first child appears second. In this case it is understood that Hiraṇyākṣa, the second child conceived, was delivered first, whereas Hiraṇyakaśipu, the child who was behind him, having been conceived first, was born second.

### Verse text

*cakre hiraṇyakaśipur  
dorbhyāṁ brahma-vareṇa ca  
vaśe sa-pālāḻ lokāṁs trīn  
akuto-mṛtyur uddhataḥ*

### Synonyms

*cakre* — made; *hiraṇyakaśipuḥ* — Hiraṇyakaśipu; *dorbhyām* — by his two arms; *brahma*-*vareṇa* — by the benediction of Brahmā; *ca* — and; *vaśe* — under his control; *sa*-*pālān* — along with their protectors; *lokān* — the worlds; *trīn* — three; *akutaḥ*-*mṛtyuḥ* — fearing death from no one; *uddhataḥ* — puffed up.

### Translation

**The elder child, Hiraṇyakaśipu, was unafraid of death from anyone within the three worlds because he received a benediction from Lord Brahmā. He was proud and puffed up due to this benediction and was able to bring all three planetary systems under his control.**

### Purport

As will be revealed in later chapters, Hiraṇyakaśipu underwent severe austerity and penance to satisfy Brahmā and thus receive a benediction of immortality. Actually, it is impossible even for Lord Brahmā to give anyone the benediction of becoming immortal, but indirectly Hiraṇyakaśipu received the benediction that no one within this material world would be able to kill him. In other words, because he originally came from the abode of Vaikuṇṭha, he was not to be killed by anyone within this material world. The Lord desired to appear Himself to kill him. One may be very proud of his material advancement in knowledge, but he cannot be immune to the four principles of material existence, namely birth, death, old age and disease. It was the Lord’s plan to teach people that even Hiraṇyakaśipu, who was so powerful and strongly built, could not live more than his destined duration of life. One may become as strong and puffed up as Hiraṇyakaśipu and bring under his control all the three worlds, but there is no possibility of continuing life eternally or keeping the conquered booty forever. So many emperors have ascended to power, and they are now lost in oblivion; that is the history of the world.

*hiraṇyākṣaḥ* — Hiraṇyākṣa; *anujaḥ* — younger brother; *tasya* — his; *priyaḥ* — beloved; *prīti*-*kṛt* — ready to please; *anu*-*aham* — every day; *gadā*-*pāṇiḥ* — with a club in hand; *divam* — to the higher planets; *yātaḥ* — traveled; *yuyutsuḥ* — desirous to fight; *mṛgayan* — seeking; *raṇam* — combat.

### Translation

**His younger brother, Hiraṇyākṣa, was always ready to satisfy his elder brother by his activities. Hiraṇyākṣa took a club on his shoulder and traveled all over the universe with a fighting spirit just to satisfy Hiraṇyakaśipu.**

### Purport

The demoniac spirit is to train all family members to exploit the resources of this universe for personal sense gratification, whereas the godly spirit is to engage everything in the service of the Lord. Hiraṇyakaśipu was himself very powerful, and he made his younger brother, Hiraṇyākṣa, powerful to assist him in fighting with everyone and lording it over material nature as long as possible. If possible, he wanted to rule the universe eternally. These are demonstrations of the spirit of the demoniac living entity.

### Purport

The *asuras* are generally strongly built, as described here, and therefore their mental condition is very sound, and their prowess is also extraordinary. Hiraṇyākṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, having received the boon that they would not be killed by any other living entity within this universe, were almost immortal, and thus they were completely fearless.

Materialistic demons sometimes appear to be very powerful and are seen to establish their supremacy throughout the world. Here also it appears that Hiraṇyākṣa, by his demoniac strength, actually established his supremacy throughout the universe, and the demigods were afraid of his uncommon power. Not only were the demigods in space afraid of the demons Hiraṇyakaśipu and Hiraṇyākṣa, but so also were the aquatic animals within the sea.

### Purport

The demoniac person always challenges others and tries to occupy others’ property by force. Here these symptoms are fully displayed by Hiraṇyākṣa, who begged war from a person who had no desire to fight.

### Purport

*Asuras* do not know that their bodies consist of the five elements of material nature and that when they fall they become objects of pastimes for dogs and vultures. Varuṇa advised Hiraṇyākṣa to meet Viṣṇu in His boar incarnation so that his hankering for aggressive war would be satisfied and his powerful body would be vanquished.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Victory of Hiraṇyākṣa Over All the Directions of the Universe.”*
