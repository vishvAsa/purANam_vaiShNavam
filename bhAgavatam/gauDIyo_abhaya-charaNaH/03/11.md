### Devanagari

मैत्रेय उवाच  
चरम- सद्विशेषाणामनेकोऽसंयुत- सदा ।  
परमाणु- स विज्ञेयो नृणामैक्यभ्रमो यत- ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

maitreya uvāca  
*caramaḥ sad-viśeṣāṇām  
aneko ’saṁyutaḥ sadā  
paramāṇuḥ sa vijñeyo  
nṛṇām aikya-bhramo yataḥ*

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* *uvāca* — Maitreya said; *caramaḥ* — ultimate; *sat* — effect; *viśeṣāṇām* — symptoms; *anekaḥ* — innumerable; *asaṁyutaḥ* — unmixed; *sadā* — always; *parama*-*aṇuḥ* — atoms; *saḥ* — that; *vijñeyaḥ* — should be understood; *nṛṇām* — of men; *aikya* — oneness; *bhramaḥ* — mistaken; *yataḥ* — from which.

### Translation

**The material manifestation’s ultimate particle, which is indivisible and not formed into a body, is called the atom. It exists always as an invisible identity, even after the dissolution of all forms. The material body is but a combination of such atoms, but it is misunderstood by the common man.**

### Purport

The atomic description of the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is almost the same as the modern science of atomism, and this is further described in the Paramāṇu-vāda of Kaṇāda. In modern science also, the atom is accepted as the ultimate indivisible particle of which the universe is composed. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the full text of all descriptions of knowledge, including the theory of atomism. The atom is the minute subtle form of eternal time.

सत एव पदार्थस्य स्वरूपावस्थितस्य यत् ।  
कैवल्यं परममहानविशेषो निरन्तर- ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*sata eva padārthasya  
svarūpāvasthitasya yat  
kaivalyaṁ parama-mahān  
aviśeṣo nirantaraḥ*

### Synonyms

*sataḥ* — of the effective manifestation; *eva* — certainly; *pada*-*arthasya* — of physical bodies; *svarūpa*-*avasthitasya* — staying in the same form even to the time of dissolution; *yat* — that which; *kaivalyam* — oneness; *parama* — the supreme; *mahān* — unlimited; *aviśeṣaḥ* — forms; *nirantaraḥ* — eternally.

### Translation

**Atoms are the ultimate state of the manifest universe. When they stay in their own forms without forming different bodies, they are called the unlimited oneness. There are certainly different bodies in physical forms, but the atoms themselves form the complete manifestation.**

एवं कालोऽप्यनुमित- सौक्ष्म्ये स्थौल्ये च सत्तम ।  
संस्थानभुक्त्या भगवानव्यक्तो व्यक्तभुग्विभु- ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*evaṁ kālo ’py anumitaḥ  
saukṣmye sthaulye ca sattama  
saṁsthāna-bhuktyā bhagavān  
avyakto vyakta-bhug vibhuḥ*

### Synonyms

*evam* — thus; *kālaḥ* — time; *api* — also; *anumitaḥ* — measured; *saukṣmye* — in the subtle; *sthaulye* — in the gross forms; *ca* — also; *sattama* — O best; *saṁsthāna* — combinations of the atoms; *bhuktyā* — by the motion; *bhagavān* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *avyaktaḥ* — unmanifested; *vyakta*-*bhuk* — controlling all physical movement; *vibhuḥ* — the Almighty.

### Translation

**One can estimate time by measuring the movement of the atomic combination of bodies. Time is the potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, Hari, who controls all physical movement although He is not visible in the physical world.**

## Text 4

### Devanagari

स काल- परमाणुर्वै यो भुङ्क्ते परमाणुताम् ।  
सतोऽविशेषभुग्यस्तु स काल- परमो महान् ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*sa kālaḥ paramāṇur vai  
yo bhuṅkte paramāṇutām  
sato ’viśeṣa-bhug yas tu  
sa kālaḥ paramo mahān*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — that; *kālaḥ* — eternal time; *parama*-*aṇuḥ* — atomic; *vai* — certainly; *yaḥ* — which; *bhuṅkte* — passes through; *parama*-*aṇutām* — the space of an atom; *sataḥ* — of the entire aggregate; *aviśeṣa*-*bhuk* — passing through the nondual exhibition; *yaḥ* *tu* — which; *saḥ* — that; *kālaḥ* — time; *paramaḥ* — the supreme; *mahān* — the great.

### Translation

**Atomic time is measured according to its covering a particular atomic space. That time which covers the unmanifest aggregate of atoms is called the great time.**

### Purport

Time and space are two correlative terms. Time is measured in terms of its covering a certain space of atoms. Standard time is calculated in terms of the movement of the sun. The time covered by the sun in passing over an atom is calculated as atomic time. The greatest time of all covers the entire existence of the nondual manifestation. All the planets rotate and cover space, and space is calculated in terms of atoms. Each planet has its particular orbit for rotating, in which it moves without deviation, and similarly the sun has its orbit. The complete calculation of the time of creation, maintenance and dissolution, measured in terms of the circulation of the total planetary systems until the end of creation, is known as the supreme *kāla.*

### Verse text

*aṇur dvau paramāṇū syāt  
trasareṇus trayaḥ smṛtaḥ  
jālārka-raśmy-avagataḥ  
kham evānupatann agāt*

### Synonyms

*aṇuḥ* — double atom; *dvau* — two; *parama*-*aṇu* — atoms; *syāt* — become; *trasareṇuḥ* — hexatom; *trayaḥ* — three; *smṛtaḥ* — considered; *jāla*-*arka* — of sunshine through the holes of a window screen; *raśmi* — by the rays; *avagataḥ* — can be known; *kham* *eva* — towards the sky; *anupatan* *agāt* — going up.

### Translation

**The division of gross time is calculated as follows: two atoms make one double atom, and three double atoms make one hexatom. This hexatom is visible in the sunshine which enters through the holes of a window screen. One can clearly see that the hexatom goes up towards the sky.**

### Purport

The atom is described as an invisible particle, but when six such atoms combine together, they are called a *trasareṇu,* and this is visible in the sunshine pouring through the holes of a window screen.

## Text 6

### Devanagari

त्रसरेणुत्रिकं भुङ्क्ते य- काल- स त्रुटि- स्मृत- ।  
शतभागस्तु वेध- स्यात्तैस्त्रिभिस्तु लव- स्मृत- ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

*trasareṇu-trikaṁ bhuṅkte  
yaḥ kālaḥ sa truṭiḥ smṛtaḥ  
śata-bhāgas tu vedhaḥ syāt  
tais tribhis tu lavaḥ smṛtaḥ*

### Synonyms

*trasareṇu*-*trikam* — combination of three hexatoms; *bhuṅkte* — as they take time to integrate; *yaḥ* — that which; *kālaḥ* — duration of time; *saḥ* — that; *truṭiḥ* — by the name *truṭi*; *smṛtaḥ* — is called; *śata*-*bhāgaḥ* — one hundred *truṭis*; *tu* — but; *vedhaḥ* — called a *vedha*; *syāt* — it so happens; *taiḥ* — by them; *tribhiḥ* — three times; *tu* — but; *lavaḥ* — *lava*; *smṛtaḥ* — so called.

### Translation

**The time duration needed for the integration of three trasareṇus is called a truṭi, and one hundred truṭis make one vedha. Three vedhas make one lava.**

### Purport

It is calculated that if a second is divided into 1, 687.5 parts, each part is the duration of a *truṭi,* which is the time occupied in the integration of eighteen atomic particles. Such a combination of atoms into different bodies creates the calculation of material time. The sun is the central point for calculating all different durations.

निमेषस्त्रिलवो ज्ञेय आम्नातस्ते त्रय- क्षण- ।  
क्षणान् पञ्च विदु- काष्ठां लघु ता दश पञ्च च ॥ ७ ॥

### Verse text

*nimeṣas tri-lavo jñeya  
āmnātas te trayaḥ kṣaṇaḥ  
kṣaṇān pañca viduḥ kāṣṭhāṁ  
laghu tā daśa pañca ca*

### Synonyms

*nimeṣaḥ* — the duration of time called a *nimeṣa*; *tri*-*lavaḥ* — the duration of three *lavas*; *jñeyaḥ* — is to be known; *āmnātaḥ* — it is so called; *te* — they; *trayaḥ* — three; *kṣaṇaḥ* — the duration of time called a *kṣaṇa*; *kṣaṇān* — such *kṣaṇas*; *pañca* — five; *viduḥ* — one should understand; *kāṣṭhām* — the duration of time called a *kāṣṭhā*; *laghu* — the duration of time called a *laghu*; *tāḥ* — those; *daśa* *pañca* — fifteen; *ca* — also.

### Translation

**The duration of time of three lavas is equal to one nimeṣa, the combination of three nimeṣas makes one kṣaṇa, five kṣaṇas combined together make one kāṣṭhā, and fifteen kāṣṭhās make one laghu.**

### Purport

By calculation it is found that one *laghu* is equal to two minutes. The atomic calculation of time in terms of Vedic wisdom may be converted into present time with this understanding.

## Text 9

### Devanagari

द्वादशार्धपलोन्मानं चतुर्भिश्चतुरङ्गुलै- ।  
स्वर्णमाषै- कृतच्छिद्रं यावत्प्रस्थजलप्लुतम् ॥ ९ ॥

### Verse text

*dvādaśārdha-palonmānaṁ  
caturbhiś catur-aṅgulaiḥ  
svarṇa-māṣaiḥ kṛta-cchidraṁ  
yāvat prastha-jala-plutam*

### Synonyms

*dvādaśa*-*ardha* — six; *pala* — of the scale of weight; *unmānam* — measuring pot; *caturbhiḥ* — by weight of four; *catuḥ*-*aṅgulaiḥ* — four fingers by measure; *svarṇa* — of gold; *māṣaiḥ* — of the weight; *kṛta*-*chidram* — making a hole; *yāvat* — as long as; *prastha* — measuring one *prastha*; *jala*-*plutam* — filled by water.

### Translation

**The measuring pot for one nāḍikā, or daṇḍa, can be prepared with a six-pala-weight \[fourteen ounce\] pot of copper, in which a hole is bored with a gold probe weighing four māṣa and measuring four fingers long. When the pot is placed on water, the time before the water overflows in the pot is called one daṇḍa.**

### Purport

It is advised herein that the bore in the copper measuring pot must be made with a probe weighing not more than four *māṣa* and measuring not longer than four fingers. This regulates the diameter of the hole. The pot is submerged in water, and the overflooding time is called a *daṇḍa.* This is another way of measuring the duration of a *daṇḍa,* just as time is measured by sand in a glass. It appears that in the days of Vedic civilization there was no dearth of knowledge in physics, chemistry or higher mathematics. Measurements were calculated in different ways, as simply as could be done.

*graha* — influential planets like the moon; *ṛkṣa* — luminaries like Aśvinī; *tārā* — stars; *cakra*-*sthaḥ* — in the orbit; *parama*-*aṇu*-*ādinā* — along with the atoms; *jagat* — the entire universe; *saṁvatsara*-*avasānena* — by the end of one year; *paryeti* — completes its orbit; *animiṣaḥ* — the eternal time; *vibhuḥ* — the Almighty.

### Translation

**Influential stars, planets, luminaries and atoms all over the universe are rotating in their respective orbits under the direction of the Supreme, represented by eternal kāla.**

### Purport

In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* it is stated that the sun is the eye of the Supreme and it rotates in its particular orbit of time. Similarly, beginning from the sun down to the atom, all bodies are under the influence of the *kāla-cakra,* or the orbit of eternal time, and each of them has a scheduled orbital time of one *saṁvatsara.*

## Text 14

viduraivaṁ prabhāṣyate*

### Synonyms

*saṁvatsaraḥ* — orbit of the sun; *parivatsaraḥ* — circumambulation of Bṛhaspati; *iḍā*-*vatsaraḥ* — orbit of the stars; *eva* — as they are; *ca* — also; *anuvatsaraḥ* — orbit of the moon; *vatsaraḥ* — one calendar year; *ca* — also; *vidura* — O Vidura; *evam* — thus; *prabhāṣyate* — they are so told.

### Translation

**There are five different names for the orbits of the sun, moon, stars and luminaries in the firmament, and they each have their own saṁvatsara.**

### Purport

The subject matters of physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, time and space dealt with in the above verses of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* are certainly very interesting to students of the particular subject, but as far as we are concerned, we cannot explain them very thoroughly in terms of technical knowledge. The subject is summarized by the statement that above all the different branches of knowledge is the supreme control of *kāla,* the plenary representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing exists without Him, and therefore everything, however wonderful it may appear to our meager knowledge, is but the work of the magical wand of the Supreme Lord. As far as time is concerned, we beg to subjoin herewith a table of timings in terms of the modern clock.

One *truṭi* — 8/13,500 second

One *vedha* — 8/135 second

One *lava* — 8/45 second

One *nimeṣa* — 8/15 second

One *kṣaṇa* — 8/5 second

One *kāṣṭhā* — 8 seconds

One *laghu* — 2 minutes

One *daṇḍa* — 30 minutes

One *prahara* — 3 hours

One day — 12 hours

One night — 12 hours

One *pakṣa* — 15 days

Two *pakṣas* comprise one month, and twelve months comprise one calendar year, or one full orbit of the sun. A human being is expected to live up to one hundred years. That is the way of the controlling measure of eternal time.

The *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.52) affirms this control in this way:

*yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ  
rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ  
yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time. The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light.”

*yaḥ* — one who; *sṛjya* — of creation; *śaktim* — the seeds; *urudhā* — in various ways; *ucchvasayan* — invigorating; *sva*-*śaktyā* — by his own energy; *puṁsaḥ* — of the living entity; *abhramāya* — to dissipate darkness; *divi* — during the daytime; *dhāvati* — moves; *bhūta*-*bhedaḥ* — distinct from all other material form; *kāla*-*ākhyayā* — by the name eternal time; *guṇa*-*mayam* — the material results; *kratubhiḥ* — by offerings; *vitanvan* — enlarging; *tasmai* — unto him; *balim* — ingredients of offerings; *harata* — one should offer; *vatsara*-*pañcakāya* — offerings every five years.

### Translation

**O Vidura, the sun enlivens all living entities with his unlimited heat and light. He diminishes the duration of life of all living entities in order to release them from their illusion of material attachment, and he enlarges the path of elevation to the heavenly kingdom. He thus moves in the firmament with great velocity, and therefore everyone should offer him respects once every five years with all ingredients of worship.**

### Synonyms

*viduraḥ* *uvāca* — Vidura said; *pitṛ* — the Pitā planets; *deva* — the heavenly planets; *manuṣyāṇām* — and that of the human beings; *āyuḥ* — duration of life; *param* — final; *idam* — in their own measurement; *smṛtam* — calculated; *pareṣām* — of the superior living entities; *gatim* — duration of life; *ācakṣva* — kindly calculate; *ye* — all those who; *syuḥ* — are; *kalpāt* — from the millennium; *bahiḥ* — outside; *vidaḥ* — greatly learned.

### Translation

**Vidura said: I now understand the life durations of the residents of the Pitā planets and heavenly planets as well as that of the human beings. Now kindly inform me of the durations of life of those greatly learned living entities who are beyond the range of a kalpa.**

### Purport

The partial dissolution of the universe that takes place at the end of Brahmā’s day does not affect all the planetary systems. The planets of highly learned living entities like the sages Sanaka and Bhṛgu are not affected by the dissolutions of the millenniums. All the planets are of different types, and each is controlled by a different *kāla-cakra,* or schedule of eternal time. The time of the earth planet is not applicable to other, more elevated planets. Therefore, Vidura herein inquires about the duration of life on other planets.

### Translation

**O spiritually powerful one, you can understand the movements of eternal time, which is the controlling form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because you are a self-realized person, you can see everything by the power of mystic vision.**

### Purport

Those who have reached the highest perfectional stage of mystic power and can see everything in the past, present and future are called *tri-kāla-jñas.* Similarly, the devotees of the Lord can see everything clearly that is in the revealed scriptures. The devotees of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can very easily understand the science of Kṛṣṇa, as well as the situation of the material and spiritual creations, without difficulty. Devotees do not have to endeavor for any *yoga-siddhi,* or perfection in mystic powers. They are competent to understand everything by the grace of the Lord, who is sitting in everyone’s heart.

### Translation

**Maitreya said: O Vidura, the four millenniums are called the Satya-, Tretā-, Dvāpara- and Kali-yuga. The aggregate number of years of all of these combined is equal to twelve thousand years of the demigods.**

### Purport

The years of the demigods are equal to 360 years of humankind. As will be clarified in the subsequent verses, 12,000 of the demigods’ years, including the transitional periods which are called *yuga-sandhyās,* comprise the total of the aforementioned four millenniums. Thus the aggregate of the above-mentioned four millenniums is 4,320,000 years.

As aforementioned, one year of the demigods is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 × 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 × 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 × 360, or 864,000 years. And the last, the Kali-yuga, is 1,200 × 360, or 432,000 years.

In other words, at present there is one part religion and three parts irreligion. Therefore people in this age are not very happy.

When Brahmā goes to sleep in his nighttime, the three planetary systems below Brahmaloka are all submerged in the water of devastation. In his sleeping condition, Brahmā dreams about the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and takes instruction from the Lord for the rehabilitation of the devastated area of space.

### Purport

This verse is an explanation of the night of Brahmā, which is the effect of the influence of time in touch with an insignificant portion of the modes of material nature in darkness. The dissolution of the three worlds is effected by the incarnation of darkness, Rudra, represented by the fire of eternal time which blazes over the three worlds. These three worlds are known as Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ and Svaḥ (Pātāla, Martya and Svarga). The innumerable living entities merge into that dissolution, which appears to be the dropping of the curtain of the scene of the Supreme Lord’s energy, and so everything becomes silent.

These reactions of 72,000 years are the beginning of the partial devastation of the three worlds. People forget all these devastations of the worlds and think themselves happy in the material progress of civilization. This is called *māyā,* or “that which is not.”

### Translation

**Thus the process of the exhaustion of the duration of life exists for every one of the living beings, including Lord Brahmā. One’s life endures for only one hundred years, in terms of the times in the different planets.**

### Purport

Every living being lives for one hundred years in terms of the times in different planets for different entities. These one hundred years of life are not equal in every case. The longest duration of one hundred years belongs to Brahmā, but although the life of Brahmā is very long, it expires in the course of time. Brahmā is also afraid of his death, and thus he performs devotional service to the Lord, just to release himself from the clutches of illusory energy. Animals, of course, have no sense of responsibility, but even humans, who have developed a sense of responsibility, while away their valuable time without engaging in devotional service to the Lord; they live merrily, unafraid of impending death. This is the madness of human society. The madman has no responsibility in life. Similarly, a human being who does not develop a sense of responsibility before he dies is no better than the madman who tries to enjoy material life very happily without concern for the future. It is necessary that every human being be responsible in preparing himself for the next life, even if he has a duration of life like that of Brahmā, the greatest of all living creatures within the universe.

### Translation

**The one hundred years of Brahmā’s life are divided into two parts, the first half and the second half. The first half of the duration of Brahmā’s life is already over, and the second half is now current.**

### Purport

The duration of one hundred years in the life of Brahmā has already been discussed in many places in this work, and it is described in *Bhagavad-gītā* (8.17) also. Fifty years of the life of Brahmā are already over, and fifty years are yet to be completed; then, for Brahmā also, death is inevitable.

### Translation

**In the beginning of the first half of Brahmā’s life, there was a millennium called Brāhma-kalpa, wherein Lord Brahmā appeared. The birth of the Vedas was simultaneous with Brahmā’s birth.**

### Purport

According to *Padma Purāṇa* (*Prabhāsa-khaṇḍa*), in thirty days of Brahmā many *kalpas* take place, such as the Varāha-kalpa and Pitṛ-kalpa. Thirty days make one month of Brahmā, beginning from the full moon to the disappearance of the moon. Twelve such months complete one year, and fifty years complete one *parārdha,* or one half the duration of the life of Brahmā. The Śveta-varāha appearance of the Lord is the first birthday of Brahmā. The birth date of Brahmā is in the month of March, according to Hindu astronomical calculation. This statement is reproduced from the explanation of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.

### Translation

**The millennium which followed the first Brāhma millennium is known as the Pādma-kalpa because in that millennium the universal lotus flower grew out of the navel reservoir of water of the Personality of Godhead, Hari.**

### Purport

The millennium following the Brāhma-kalpa is known as the Pādma-kalpa because the universal lotus grows in that millennium. The Pādma-kalpa is also called the Pitṛ-kalpa in certain *Purāṇas.*

### Translation

**O descendant of Bharata, the first millennium in the second half of the life of Brahmā is also known as the Vārāha millennium because the Personality of Godhead appeared in that millennium as the hog incarnation.**

### Purport

The different millenniums known as the Brāhma, Pādma and Vārāha *kalpas* appear a little puzzling for the layman. There are some scholars who think these *kalpas* to be one and the same. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī, the Brāhma-kalpa in the beginning of the first half appears to be the Pādma-kalpa. We can, however, simply abide by the text and understand that the present millennium is in the second half of the duration of the life of Brahmā.

### Translation

**The duration of the two parts of Brahmā’s life, as above mentioned, is calculated to be equal to one nimeṣa \[less than a second\] for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unchanging and unlimited and is the cause of all causes of the universe.**

### Purport

The great sage Maitreya has given a considerable description of the time of different dimensions, beginning from the atom up to the duration of the life of Brahmā. Now he attempts to give some idea of the time of the unlimited Personality of Godhead. He just gives a hint of His unlimited time by the standard of the life of Brahmā. The entire duration of the life of Brahmā is calculated to be less than a second of the Lord’s time, and it is explained in the *Brahma-saṁhitā* (5.48) as follows:

*yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya  
jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ  
viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo  
govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi*

“I worship Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, whose plenary portion is Mahā-Viṣṇu. All the heads of the innumerable universes \[the Brahmās\] live only by taking shelter of the time occupied by one of His breaths.” The impersonalists do not believe in the form of the Lord, and thus they would hardly believe in the Lord’s sleeping. Their idea is obtained by a poor fund of knowledge; they calculate everything in terms of man’s capacity. They think that the existence of the Supreme is just the opposite of active human existence: because the human being has senses, the Supreme must be without sense perception; because the human being has a form, the Supreme must be formless; and because the human being sleeps, the Supreme must not sleep. *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* however, does not agree with such impersonalists. It is clearly stated herein that the Supreme Lord rests in *yoga-nidrā,* as previously discussed. And because He sleeps, naturally He must breathe, and the *Brahma-saṁhitā* confirms that within His breathing period innumerable Brahmās take birth and die.

There is complete agreement between *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and the *Brahma-saṁhitā.* Eternal time is never lost along with the life of Brahmā. It continues, but it has no ability to control the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is the controller of time. In the spiritual world there is undoubtedly time, but it has no control over activities. Time is unlimited, and the spiritual world is also unlimited, since everything there exists on the absolute plane.

कालोऽयं परमाण्वादिर्द्विपरार्धान्त ईश्वर- ।  
नैवेशितुं प्रभुर्भूम्न ईश्वरो धाममानिनाम् ॥ ३९ ॥

### Verse text

*kālo ’yaṁ paramāṇv-ādir  
dvi-parārdhānta īśvaraḥ  
naiveśituṁ prabhur bhūmna  
īśvaro dhāma-māninām*

### Synonyms

*kālaḥ* — the eternal time; *ayam* — this; *parama*-*aṇu* — atom; *ādiḥ* — beginning from; *dvi*-*parārdha* — two superdurations of time; *antaḥ* — to the end; *īśvaraḥ* — controller; *na* — never; *eva* — certainly; *īśitum* — to control; *prabhuḥ* — capable; *bhūmnaḥ* — of the Supreme; *īśvaraḥ* — controller; *dhāma*-*māninām* — of those who are body conscious.

### Translation

**Eternal time is certainly the controller of different dimensions, from that of the atom up to the superdivisions of the duration of Brahmā’s life; but, nevertheless, it is controlled by the Supreme. Time can control only those who are body conscious, even up to the Satyaloka or the other higher planets of the universe.**

### Translation

**This phenomenal material world is expanded to a diameter of four billion miles, as a combination of eight material elements transformed into sixteen further categories, within and without, as follows.**

### Purport

As explained before, the entire material world is a display of sixteen diversities and eight material elements. The analytical studies of the material world are the subject matter of Sāṅkhya philosophy. The first sixteen diversities are the eleven senses and five sense objects, and the eight elements are the gross and subtle matter, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and ego. All these combined together are distributed throughout the entire universe, which extends diametrically to four billion miles. Besides this universe of our experience, there are innumerable other universes. Some of them are bigger than the present one, and all of them are clustered together under similar material elements as described below.

### Translation

**The layers or elements covering the universes are each ten times thicker than the one before, and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination.**

### Purport

The coverings of the universes are also constituted of the elements of earth, water, fire, air and ether, and each is ten times thicker than the one before. The first covering of the universe is earth, and it is ten times thicker than the universe itself. If the universe is four billion miles in size, then the size of the earthly covering of the universe is four billion times ten. The covering of water is ten times greater than the earthly covering, the covering of fire is ten times greater than the watery covering, the covering of air is ten times greater than that of the fire, the covering of ether is ten times greater still than that of air, and so on. The universe within the coverings of matter appears to be like an atom in comparison to the coverings, and the number of universes is unknown even to those who can estimate the coverings of the universes.

तदाहुरक्षरं ब्रह्म सर्वकारणकारणम् ।  
विष्णोर्धाम परं साक्षात्पुरुषस्य महात्मन- ॥ ४२ ॥

### Verse text

*tad āhur akṣaraṁ brahma  
sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam  
viṣṇor dhāma paraṁ sākṣāt  
puruṣasya mahātmanaḥ*

### Synonyms

*tat* — that; *āhuḥ* — is said; *akṣaram* — infallible; *brahma* — the supreme; *sarva*-*kāraṇa* — all causes; *kāraṇam* — the supreme cause; *viṣṇoḥ* *dhāma* — the spiritual abode of Viṣṇu; *param* — the supreme; *sākṣāt* — without doubt; *puruṣasya* — of the *puruṣa* incarnation; *mahātmanaḥ* — of the Mahā-Viṣṇu.

### Translation

**The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is therefore said to be the original cause of all causes. Thus the spiritual abode of Viṣṇu is eternal without a doubt, and it is also the abode of Mahā-Viṣṇu, the origin of all manifestations.**

### Purport

Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is resting in *yoga-nidrā* on the Causal Ocean and creating innumerable universes by His breathing process, only temporarily appears in the *mahat-tattva* for the temporary manifestation of the material worlds. He is a plenary portion of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus although He is nondifferent from Lord Kṛṣṇa, His formal appearance in the material world as an incarnation is temporary. The original form of the Personality of Godhead is actually the *svarūpa,* or real form, and He eternally resides in the Vaikuṇṭha world (Viṣṇuloka). The word *mahātmanaḥ* is used here to indicate Mahā-Viṣṇu, and His real manifestation is Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is called *parama,* as confirmed in the *Brahma-saṁhitā:*

*īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ  
sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ  
anādir ādir govindaḥ  
sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam*

“The Supreme Lord is Kṛṣṇa, the original Personality of Godhead, known as Govinda. His form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, and He is the original cause of all causes.”

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Calculation of Time, from the Atom.”*
