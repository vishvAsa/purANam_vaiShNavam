### Devanagari

मैत्रेय उवाच  
अथ तस्य पुनर्विप्रैरपुत्रस्य महीपते- ।  
बाहुभ्यां मथ्यमानाभ्यां मिथुनं समपद्यत ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

maitreya uvāca  
*atha tasya punar viprair  
aputrasya mahīpateḥ

mithunaṁ samapadyata*

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* *uvāca* — Maitreya continued to speak; *atha* — thus; *tasya* — his; *punaḥ* — again; *vipraiḥ* — by the *brāhmaṇas*; *aputrasya* — without a son; *mahīpateḥ* — of the King; *bāhubhyām* — from the arms; *mathyamānābhyām* — being churned; *mithunam* — a couple; *samapadyata* — took birth.

### Translation

**The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, thus the brāhmaṇas and the great sages again churned the two arms of King Vena’s dead body. As a result a male and female couple came out of his arms.**

### Devanagari

तद् दृष्ट्वा मिथुनं जातमृषयो ब्रह्मवादिन- ।  
ऊचु- परमसन्तुष्टा विदित्वा भगवत्कलाम् ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*tad dṛṣṭvā mithunaṁ jātam  
ṛṣayo brahma-vādinaḥ  
ūcuḥ parama-santuṣṭā  
viditvā bhagavat-kalām*

### Synonyms

*tat* — that; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *mithunam* — couple; *jātam* — born; *ṛṣayaḥ* — the great sages; *brahma*-*vādinaḥ* — very learned in Vedic knowledge; *ūcuḥ* — said; *parama* — very much; *santuṣṭāḥ* — being pleased; *viditvā* — knowing; *bhagavat* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kalām* — expansion.

### Translation

**The great sages were highly learned in Vedic knowledge. When they saw the male and female born of the arms of Vena’s body, they were very pleased, for they could understand that the couple was an expansion of a plenary portion of Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

The method adopted by the great sages and scholars, who were learned in Vedic knowledge, was perfect. They removed all the reactions of King Vena’s sinful activities by seeing that King Vena first gave birth to Bāhuka, described in the previous chapter. After King Vena’s body was thus purified, a male and female came out of it, and the great sages could understand that this was an expansion of Lord Viṣṇu. This expansion, of course, was not *viṣṇu-tattva* but a specifically empowered expansion of Lord Viṣṇu known as *āveśa.*

ऋषय ऊचु-  
एष विष्णोर्भगवत- कला भुवनपालिनी ।  
इयं च लक्ष्म्या- सम्भूति- पुरुषस्यानपायिनी ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

ṛṣaya ūcuḥ  
*eṣa viṣṇor bhagavataḥ  
kalā bhuvana-pālinī  
iyaṁ ca lakṣmyāḥ sambhūtiḥ  
puruṣasyānapāyinī*

### Synonyms

*ṛṣayaḥ* *ūcuḥ* — the sages said; *eṣaḥ* — this male; *viṣṇoḥ* — of Lord Viṣṇu; *bhagavataḥ* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kalā* — expansion; *bhuvana*-*pālinī* — who maintains the world; *iyam* — this female; *ca* — also; *lakṣmyāḥ* — of the goddess of fortune; *sambhūtiḥ* — expansion; *puruṣasya* — of the Lord; *anapāyinī* — inseparable.

### Translation

**The great sages said: The male is a plenary expansion of the power of Lord Viṣṇu, who maintains the entire universe, and the female is a plenary expansion of the goddess of fortune, who is never separated from the Lord.**

### Purport

The significance of the goddess of fortune’s never being separated from the Lord is clearly mentioned herein. People in the material world are very fond of the goddess of fortune, and they want her favor in the form of riches. They should know, however, that the goddess of fortune is inseparable from Lord Viṣṇu. Materialists should understand that the goddess of fortune should be worshiped along with Lord Viṣṇu and should not be regarded separately. Materialists seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune must worship Lord Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī together to maintain material opulence. If a materialist follows the policy of Rāvaṇa, who wanted to separate Sītā from Lord Rāmacandra, the process of separation will vanquish him. Those who are very rich and have taken favor of the goddess of fortune in this world must engage their money in the service of the Lord. In this way they can continue in their opulent position without disturbance.

अयं तु प्रथमो राज्ञां पुमान् प्रथयिता यश- ।  
पृथुर्नाम महाराजो भविष्यति पृथुश्रवा- ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

bhaviṣyati pṛthu-śravāḥ*

### Translation

**Of the two, the male will be able to expand his reputation throughout the world. His name will be Pṛthu. Indeed, he will be the first among kings.**

### Purport

There are different types of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the *śāstras* it is said that Garuḍa (the carrier of Lord Viṣṇu) and Lord Śiva and Ananta are all very powerful incarnations of the Brahman feature of the Lord. Similarly, Śacīpati, or Indra, the King of heaven, is an incarnation of the lusty feature of the Lord. Aniruddha is an incarnation of the Lord’s mind. Similarly, King Pṛthu is an incarnation of the ruling force of the Lord. Thus the saintly persons and great sages predicted the future activities of King Pṛthu, who was already explained as a partial incarnation of a plenary expansion of the Lord.

एष साक्षाद्धरेरंशो जातो लोकरिरक्षया ।  
इयं च तत्परा हि श्रीरनुजज्ञेऽनपायिनी ॥ ६ ॥

### Verse text

**In the form of King Pṛthu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared through a part of His potency to protect the people of the world. The goddess of fortune is the constant companion of the Lord, and therefore she has incarnated partially as Arci to become King Pṛthu’s queen.**

### Purport

In *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says that whenever one sees an extraordinary power, he should conclude that a specific partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present. There are innumerable such personalities, but not all of them are direct *viṣṇu-tattva* plenary expansions of the Lord. Many living entities are classified among the *śakti-tattvas.* Such incarnations, empowered for specific purposes, are known as *śaktyāveśa-avatāras.* King Pṛthu was such a *śaktyāveśa-avatāra* of the Lord. Similarly, Arci, King Pṛthu’s wife, was a *śaktyāveśa-avatāra* of the goddess of fortune.

*pādayor aravindaṁ ca  
taṁ vai mene hareḥ kalām  
yasyāpratihataṁ cakram  
aṁśaḥ sa parameṣṭhinaḥ*

### Synonyms

*brahmā* — Lord Brahmā; *jagat*-*guruḥ* — the master of the universe; *devaiḥ* — by the demigods; *saha* — accompanied; *āsṛtya* — arriving; *sura*-*īśvaraiḥ* — with the chiefs of all the heavenly planets; *vainyasya* — of Mahārāja Pṛthu, the son of Vena; *dakṣiṇe* — right; *haste* — on the hand; *dṛṣṭvā* — seeing; *cihnam* — mark; *gadā*-*bhṛtaḥ* — of Lord Viṣṇu, who carries a club; *pādayoḥ* — on the two feet; *aravindam* — lotus flower; *ca* — also; *tam* — him; *vai* — certainly; *mene* — he understood; *hareḥ* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *kalām* — part of a plenary expansion; *yasya* — whose; *apratihatam* — invincible; *cakram* — disc; *aṁśaḥ* — partial representation; *saḥ* — he; *parameṣṭhinaḥ* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Lord Brahmā, the master of the entire universe, arrived there accompanied by all the demigods and their chiefs. Seeing the lines of Lord Viṣṇu’s palm on King Pṛthu’s right hand and impressions of lotus flowers on the soles of his feet, Lord Brahmā could understand that King Pṛthu was a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One whose palm bears the sign of a disc, as well as other such lines, should be considered a partial representation or incarnation of the Supreme Lord.**

### Purport

There is a system by which one can detect an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nowadays it has become a cheap fashion to accept any rascal as an incarnation of God, but from this incident we can see that Lord Brahmā personally examined the hands and feet of King Pṛthu for specific signs. In their prophecies the learned sages and *brāhmaṇas* accepted Pṛthu Mahārāja as a plenary partial expansion of the Lord. During the presence of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, a king declared himself Vāsudeva, and Lord Kṛṣṇa killed him. Before accepting someone as an incarnation of God, one should verify his identity according to the symptoms mentioned in the *śāstras.* Without these symptoms the pretender is subject to be killed by the authorities for pretending to be an incarnation of God.

### Purport

All the demigods presented various gifts to King Pṛthu. Hari, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Upendra in the heavenly planet, presented the King with a Sudarśana disc. It should be understood that this Sudarśana disc is not exactly the same type of Sudarśana disc used by the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu. Since Mahārāja Pṛthu was a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s power, the Sudarśana disc given to him represented the partial power of the original Sudarśana disc.

This verse describes that the King’s slippers were invested with mystic powers (*pāduke yogamayyau*). Thus as soon as the King placed his feet in the slippers they would immediately carry him wherever he desired. Mystic *yogīs* can transfer themselves from one place to another whenever they desire. A similar power was invested in the slippers of King Pṛthu.

loke ’dhunāspaṣṭa-guṇasya me syāt  
kim āśrayo me stava eṣa yojyatāṁ

### Synonyms

*pṛthuḥ* *uvāca* — King Pṛthu said; *bhoḥ* *sūta* — O *sūta*; *he* *māgadha* — O *māgadha*; *saumya* — gentle; *vandin* — O devotee offering prayers; *loke* — in this world; *adhunā* — just now; *aspaṣṭa* — not distinct; *guṇasya* — whose qualities; *me* — of me; *syāt* — there may be; *kim* — why; *āśrayaḥ* — shelter; *me* — of me; *stavaḥ* — praise; *eṣaḥ* — this; *yojyatām* — may be applied; *mā* — never; *mayi* — unto me; *abhūvan* — were; *vitathāḥ* — in vain; *giraḥ* — words; *vaḥ* — your.

### Translation

**King Pṛthu said: O gentle sūta, māgadha and other devotee offering prayers, the qualities of which you have spoken are not distinct in me. Why then should you praise me for all these qualities when I do not shelter these features? I do not wish for these words meant for me to go in vain, but it is better that they be offered to someone else.**

### Purport

The prayers and praises by the *sūta, māgadha* and *vandī* all explained the godly qualities of Mahārāja Pṛthu, for he was a *śaktyāveśa* incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the qualities were not yet manifest, however, King Pṛthu very humbly asked why the devotees should praise him with such exalted words. He did not want anyone to offer him prayers or glorify him unless he possessed the real qualities of which they spoke. The offering of prayers was certainly appropriate, for he was an incarnation of Godhead, but he warned that one should not be accepted as an incarnation of the Personality of Godhead without having the godly qualities. At the present moment there are many so-called incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, but these are merely fools and rascals whom people accept as incarnations of God although they have no godly qualities. King Pṛthu desired that his real characteristics in the future might justify such words of praise. Although there was no fault in the prayers offered, Pṛthu Mahārāja indicated that such prayers should not be offered to an unfit person who pretends to be an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

तस्मात्परोक्षेऽस्मदुपश्रुतान्यलं  
करिष्यथ स्तोत्रमपीच्यवाच- ।  
सत्युत्तमश्लोकगुणानुवादे  
जुगुप्सितं न स्तवयन्ति सभ्या- ॥ २३ ॥

### Verse text

*tasmāt parokṣe ’smad-upaśrutāny alaṁ  
kariṣyatha stotram apīcya-vācaḥ  
saty uttamaśloka-guṇānuvāde  
jugupsitaṁ na stavayanti sabhyāḥ*

### Synonyms

*tasmāt* — therefore; *parokṣe* — in some future time; *asmat* — my; *upaśrutāni* — about the qualities spoken of; *alam* — sufficiently; *kariṣyatha* — you will be able to offer; *stotram* — prayers; *apīcya*-*vācaḥ* — O gentle reciters; *sati* — being the proper engagement; *uttama*-*śloka* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *guṇa* — of the qualities; *anuvāde* — discussion; *jugupsitam* — to an abominable person; *na* — never; *stavayanti* — offer prayers; *sabhyāḥ* — persons who are gentle.

### Translation

**O gentle reciters, offer such prayers in due course of time, when the qualities of which you have spoken actually manifest themselves in me. The gentle who offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not attribute such qualities to a human being, who does not actually have them.**

### Purport

Gentle devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead know perfectly well who is God and who is not. Nondevotee impersonalists, however, who have no idea what God is and who never offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are always interested in accepting a human being as God and offering such prayers to him. This is the difference between a devotee and a demon. Demons manufacture their own gods, or a demon himself claims to be God, following in the footsteps of Rāvaṇa and Hiraṇyakaśipu. Although Pṛthu Mahārāja was factually an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he rejected those praises because the qualities of the Supreme Person were not yet manifest in him. He wanted to stress that one who does not actually possess these qualities should not try to engage his followers and devotees in offering him glory for them, even though these qualities might be manifest in the future. If a man who does not factually possess the attributes of a great personality engages his followers in praising him with the expectation that such attributes will develop in the future, that sort of praise is actually an insult.

*mahad-guṇān ātmani kartum īśaḥ  
kaḥ stāvakaiḥ stāvayate ’sato ’pi  
te ’syābhaviṣyann iti vipralabdho  
janāvahāsaṁ kumatir na veda*

### Synonyms

*mahat* — exalted; *guṇān* — the qualities; *ātmani* — in himself; *kartum* — to manifest; *īśaḥ* — competent; *kaḥ* — who; *stāvakaiḥ* — by followers; *stāvayate* — causes to be praised; *asataḥ* — not existing; *api* — although; *te* — they; *asya* — of him; *abhaviṣyan* — might have been; *iti* — thus; *vipralabdhaḥ* — cheated; *jana* — of people; *avahāsam* — insult; *kumatiḥ* — a fool; *na* — does not; *veda* — know.

### Translation

**How could an intelligent man competent enough to possess such exalted qualities allow his followers to praise him if he did not actually have them? Praising a man by saying that if he were educated he might have become a great scholar or great personality is nothing but a process of cheating. A foolish person who agrees to accept such praise does not know that such words simply insult him.**

### Purport

Pṛthu Mahārāja was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as Lord Brahmā and other demigods had already testified when they had presented the King with many heavenly gifts. Because he had just been coronated, however, he could not manifest his godly qualities in action. Therefore he was not willing to accept the praise of the devotees. So-called incarnations of Godhead should therefore take lessons from the behavior of King Pṛthu. Demons without godly qualities should not accept false praise from their followers.
