### Devanagari

मैत्रेय उवाच  
प्रजापतेर्दुहितरं शिशुमारस्य वै ध्रुव- । उपयेमे भ्रमिं नाम तत्सुतौ कल्पवत्सरौ ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

maitreya uvāca  
*prajāpater duhitaraṁ  
śiśumārasya vai dhruvaḥ  
upayeme bhramiṁ nāma  
tat-sutau kalpa-vatsarau*

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* *uvāca* — the great sage Maitreya continued; *prajāpateḥ* — of the Prajāpati; *duhitaram* — daughter; *śiśumārasya* — of Śiśumāra; *vai* — certainly; *dhruvaḥ* — Dhruva Mahārāja; *upayeme* — married; *bhramim* — Bhrami; *nāma* — named; *tat*-*sutau* — her sons; *kalpa* — Kalpa; *vatsarau* — Vatsara.

### Translation

**The great sage Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, thereafter Dhruva Mahārāja married the daughter of Prajāpati Śiśumāra, whose name was Bhrami, and two sons named Kalpa and Vatsara were born of her.**

### Purport

It appears that Dhruva Mahārāja married after being installed on the throne of his father and after the departure of his father to the forest for self-realization. It is very important to note in this connection that since Mahārāja Uttānapāda was greatly affectionate towards his son, and since it is the duty of a father to get his sons and daughters married as quickly as possible, why did he not get his son married before he left home? The answer is that Mahārāja Uttānapāda was a *rājarṣi,* saintly king. Although he was busy in his political affairs and duties of government management, he was very anxious for self-realization. Therefore as soon as his son Dhruva Mahārāja was quite worthy to take charge of the government, he took this opportunity to leave home, just like his son, who, without fear, left home for self-realization, even at the age of five years. These are rare instances from which we can see that the importance of spiritual realization is above all other important work. Mahārāja Uttānapāda knew very well that to get his son Dhruva Mahārāja married was not so important that it should take preference to his going away to the forest for self-realization.

### Verse text

*uttamas tv akṛtodvāho

ध्रुवो भ्रातृवधं श्रुत्वा कोपामर्षशुचार्पित- । जैत्रं स्यन्दनमास्थाय गत- पुण्यजनालयम् ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*dhruvo bhrātṛ-vadhaṁ śrutvā  
kopāmarṣa-śucārpitaḥ  
jaitraṁ syandanam āsthāya  
gataḥ puṇya-janālayam*

### Synonyms

*dhruvaḥ* — Dhruva Mahārāja; *bhrātṛ*-*vadham* — the killing of his brother; *śrutvā* — hearing this news; *kopa* — anger; *amarṣa* — vengeance; *śucā* — lamentation; *arpitaḥ* — being filled with; *jaitram* — victorious; *syandanam* — chariot; *āsthāya* — getting on; *gataḥ* — went; *puṇya*-*jana*-*ālayam* — to the city of the Yakṣas.

### Translation

**When Dhruva Mahārāja heard of the killing of his brother Uttama by the Yakṣas in the Himālaya Mountains, being overwhelmed with lamentation and anger, he got on his chariot and went out for victory over the city of the Yakṣas, Alakāpurī.**

### Purport

Dhruva Mahārāja’s becoming angry, overwhelmed with grief, and envious of the enemies was not incompatible with his position as a great devotee. It is a misunderstanding that a devotee should not be angry, envious or overwhelmed by lamentation. Dhruva Mahārāja was the king, and when his brother was unceremoniously killed, it was his duty to take revenge against the Yakṣas from the Himālayas.

### Purport

In this verse it is stated that the Yakṣas are more or less devotees of Lord Śiva. By this indication the Yakṣas may be taken to be the Himālayan tribes like the Tibetans.

### Purport

This spirit of fighting in a sporting attitude is very significant in this verse. The Yakṣas were severely attacked. Dhruva Mahārāja was their enemy, but still, upon witnessing the wonderful, heroic acts of Mahārāja Dhruva, they were very pleased with him. This straightforward appreciation of an enemy’s prowess is a characteristic of real *kṣatriya* spirit.

### Verse text

*auttānapādiḥ sa tadā  
śastra-varṣeṇa bhūriṇā  
na evādṛśyatācchanna  
āsāreṇa yathā giriḥ*

### Synonyms

*auttānapādiḥ* — Dhruva Mahārāja; *saḥ* — he; *tadā* — at that time; *śastra*-*varṣeṇa* — by a shower of weapons; *bhūriṇā* — incessant; *na* — not; *eva* — certainly; *adṛśyata* — was visible; *ācchannaḥ* — being covered; *āsāreṇa* — by constant rainfall; *yathā* — as; *giriḥ* — a mountain.

### Translation

**Dhruva Mahārāja was completely covered by an incessant shower of weapons, just as a mountain is covered by incessant rainfall.**

### Purport

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out in this connection that although Dhruva Mahārāja was covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, this does not mean that he succumbed in the battle. The example of a mountain peak’s being covered by incessant rain is just suitable, for when a mountain is covered by incessant rain, all dirty things are washed from the body of the mountain. Similarly, the incessant shower of arrows from the enemy gave Dhruva Mahārāja new vigor to defeat them. In other words, whatever incompetency he might have had was washed away.

हाहाकारस्तदैवासीत्सिद्धानां दिवि पश्यताम् ।

### Verse text

*hāhā-kāras tadaivāsīt  
siddhānāṁ divi paśyatām  
hato ’yaṁ mānavaḥ sūryo  
magnaḥ puṇya-janārṇave*

### Synonyms

*hāhā*-*kāraḥ* — tumult of disappointment; *tadā* — at that time; *eva* — certainly; *āsīt* — became manifest; *siddhānām* — of all the residents of Siddhaloka; *divi* — in the sky; *paśyatām* — who were observing the fight; *hataḥ* — killed; *ayam* — this; *mānavaḥ* — grandson of Manu; *sūryaḥ* — sun; *magnaḥ* — set; *puṇya*-*jana* — of the Yakṣas; *arṇave* — in the ocean.

### Translation

**All the Siddhas from the higher planetary systems were observing the fight from the sky, and when they saw that Dhruva Mahārāja had been covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, they roared tumultuously, “The grandson of Manu, Dhruva, is now lost!” They cried that Dhruva Mahārāja was just like the sun and that now he had set within the ocean of the Yakṣas.**

### Purport

In this verse the word *mānava* is very significant. Generally this word is used to mean “human being.” Dhruva Mahārāja is also described here as *mānava.* Not only is Dhruva Mahārāja a descendant of Manu, but all human society descends from Manu. According to Vedic civilization, Manu is the lawgiver. Even today Hindus in India follow the laws given by Manu. Therefore everyone in human society is a *mānava,* or descendant from Manu, but Dhruva Mahārāja is a distinguished *mānava* because he is a great devotee.

The denizens of the planet Siddhaloka, where the residents can fly in the sky without airplanes, were anxious over Dhruva Mahārāja’s welfare in the battlefield. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says, therefore, that not only is a devotee well protected by the Supreme Lord, but all the demigods, and even ordinary men, are anxious for his security and safety. The comparison given here that Dhruva Mahārāja appeared to merge in the ocean of the Yakṣas is also significant. When the sun sets on the horizon, it appears that the sun drowns in the ocean, but factually the sun has no difficulty. Similarly, although Dhruva appeared to drown in the ocean of the Yakṣas, he had no difficulty. As the sun rises again in due course at the end of night, so Dhruva Mahārāja, although he might have been in difficulty (because, after all, it was a fight, and in any fighting activities there are reverses), that did not mean that he was defeated.

*nadatsu yātudhāneṣu  
jaya-kāśiṣv atho mṛdhe

### Synonyms

*nadatsu* — while exclaiming; *yātudhāneṣu* — the ghostly Yakṣas; *jaya*-*kāśiṣu* — proclaiming victory; *atho* — then; *mṛdhe* — in the fighting; *udatiṣṭhat* — appeared; *rathaḥ* — the chariot; *tasya* — of Dhruva Mahārāja; *nīhārāt* — from the mist; *iva* — like; *bhāskaraḥ* — the sun.

### Translation

**The Yakṣas, being temporarily victorious, exclaimed that they had conquered Dhruva Mahārāja. But in the meantime Dhruva’s chariot suddenly appeared, just as the sun suddenly appears from within foggy mist.**

### Purport

Here Dhruva Mahārāja is compared to the sun and the great assembly of the Yakṣas to foggy mist. Fog is insignificant in comparison with the sun. Although the sun is sometimes seen to be covered by fog, in fact the sun cannot be covered by anything. Our eyes may be covered by a cloud, but the sun is never covered. By this comparison to the sun, the greatness of Dhruva Mahārāja in all circumstances is affirmed.

### Translation

**Dhruva Mahārāja’s bow and arrows twanged and hissed, causing lamentation in the hearts of his enemies. He began to shoot incessant arrows, shattering all their different weapons, just as the blasting wind scatters the assembled clouds in the sky.**

**The sharp arrows released from the bow of Dhruva Mahārāja pierced the shields and bodies of the enemy, like the thunderbolts released by the King of heaven, which dismantle the bodies of the mountains.**

### Synonyms

*bhallaiḥ* — by his arrows; *sañchidyamānānām* — of the Yakṣas who were cut to pieces; *śirobhiḥ* — with heads; *cāru* — beautiful; *kuṇḍalaiḥ* — with earrings; *ūrubhiḥ* — with thighs; *hema*-*tālābhaiḥ* — like golden palm trees; *dorbhiḥ* — with arms; *valaya*-*valgubhiḥ* — with beautiful bracelets; *hāra* — with garlands; *keyūra* — armlets; *mukuṭaiḥ* — and helmets; *uṣṇīṣaiḥ* — with turbans; *ca* — also; *mahā*-*dhanaiḥ* — very valuable; *āstṛtāḥ* — covered; *tāḥ* — those; *raṇa*-*bhuvaḥ* — battlefield; *rejuḥ* — began to glimmer; *vīra* — of the heroes; *manaḥ*-*harāḥ* — bewildering the minds.

### Translation

**The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, the heads of those who were cut to pieces by the arrows of Dhruva Mahārāja were decorated very beautifully with earrings and turbans. The legs of their bodies were as beautiful as golden palm trees, their arms were decorated with golden bracelets and armlets, and on their heads there were very valuable helmets bedecked with gold. All these ornaments lying on that battlefield were very attractive and could bewilder the mind of a hero.**

### Purport

It appears that in those days soldiers used to go to the battlefield highly decorated with golden ornaments and with helmets and turbans, and when they were dead the booty was taken by the enemy party. Their falling dead in battle with their many golden ornamental dresses was certainly a lucrative opportunity for the heroes on the battlefield.

Therefore, simply by chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord, many men can be fully protected from fierce death without difficulty. Thus a devotee is saved.**

### Purport

The great *ṛṣis* approached Dhruva Mahārāja at a time when his mind was very perplexed due to the magical feats exhibited by the Yakṣas. A devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His inspiration only, the sages came to encourage Dhruva Mahārāja and assure him that there was no danger because he was a soul fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord. By the grace of the Lord, if a devotee, at the time of death, can simply chant His holy name — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — simply by chanting this *mahā-mantra* he immediately surpasses the great ocean of the material sky and enters the spiritual sky. He never has to come back for repetition of birth and death. Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can surpass the ocean of death, so Dhruva Mahārāja was certainly able to surpass the illusory magical feats of the Yakṣas, which for the time being disturbed his mind.

*Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the* Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, *entitled “Dhruva Mahārāja’s Fight with the Yakṣas.”*
