### Devanagari

सूत उवाच  
निशम्य कौषारविणोपवर्णितन्ध्रुवस्य वैकुण्ठपदाधिरोहणम् । प्ररूढभावो भगवत्यधोक्षजेप्रष्टुं पुनस्तं विदुर- प्रचक्रमे ॥ १ ॥

### Verse text

sūta uvāca  
*niśamya kauṣāraviṇopavarṇitaṁ  
dhruvasya vaikuṇṭha-padādhirohaṇam  
prarūḍha-bhāvo bhagavaty adhokṣaje  
praṣṭuṁ punas taṁ viduraḥ pracakrame*

### Synonyms

*sūtaḥ* *uvāca* — Sūta Gosvāmī said; *niśamya* — after hearing; *kauṣāraviṇā* — by the sage Maitreya; *upavarṇitam* — described; *dhruvasya* — of Mahārāja Dhruva; *vaikuṇṭha*-*pada* — to the abode of Viṣṇu; *adhirohaṇam* — ascent; *prarūḍha* — increased; *bhāvaḥ* — devotional emotion; *bhagavati* — unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *adhokṣaje* — who is beyond the reach of direct perception; *praṣṭum* — to inquire; *punaḥ* — again; *tam* — unto Maitreya; *viduraḥ* — Vidura; *pracakrame* — attempted.

### Translation

**Sūta Gosvāmī, continuing to speak to all the ṛṣis, headed by Śaunaka, said: After hearing Maitreya Ṛṣi describe Dhruva Mahārāja’s ascent to Lord Viṣṇu’s abode, Vidura became very much enlightened in devotional emotion, and he inquired from Maitreya as follows.**

### Purport

As evidenced in the topics between Vidura and Maitreya, the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the devotees are so fascinating that neither the devotee who is describing them nor the devotee who is hearing is at all fatigued by the inquiries and answers. Transcendental subject matter is so nice that no one becomes tired of hearing or speaking. Others, who are not devotees, may think, “How can people devote so much time simply to talks of God?” But devotees are never satisfied or satiated in hearing and speaking about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about His devotees. The more they hear and talk, the more they become enthusiastic to hear. The chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is simply the repetition of three words — Hare, Kṛṣṇa and Rāma — but still devotees can go on chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* twenty-four hours a day without feeling fatigued.

### Verse text

vidura uvāca  
*ke te pracetaso nāma  
kasyāpatyāni suvrata  
kasyānvavāye prakhyātāḥ  
kutra vā satram āsata*

### Synonyms

*viduraḥ* *uvāca* — Vidura inquired; *ke* — who were; *te* — they; *pracetasaḥ* — the Pracetās; *nāma* — of the name; *kasya* — whose; *apatyāni* — sons; *su*-*vrata* — O Maitreya, who have taken an auspicious vow; *kasya* — whose; *anvavāye* — in the family; *prakhyātāḥ* — famous; *kutra* — where; *vā* — also; *satram* — the sacrifice; *āsata* — was performed.

### Translation

**Vidura inquired from Maitreya: O greatly advanced devotee, who were the Pracetās? To which family did they belong? Whose sons were they, and where did they perform the great sacrifices?**

### Purport

The great Nārada’s singing, in the previous chapter, of three verses in the sacrificial arena of the Pracetās gave another impetus to Vidura to ask further questions.

### Verse text

*manye mahā-bhāgavataṁ  
nāradaṁ deva-darśanam  
yena proktaḥ kriyā-yogaḥ  
paricaryā-vidhir hareḥ*

### Synonyms

*manye* — I think; *mahā*-*bhāgavatam* — the greatest of all devotees; *nāradam* — the sage Nārada; *deva* — the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *darśanam* — who met; *yena* — by whom; *proktaḥ* — spoken; *kriyā*-*yogaḥ* — devotional service; *paricaryā* — for rendering service; *vidhiḥ* — the procedure; *hareḥ* — to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

### Translation

**Vidura continued: I know that the great sage Nārada is the greatest of all devotees. He has compiled the pāñcarātrika procedure of devotional service and has directly met the Supreme Personality of Godhead.**

### Purport

There are two different ways of approaching the Supreme Lord. One is called *bhāgavata-mārga,* or the way of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,* and the other is called *pāñcarātrika-vidhi.* *Pāñcarātrika-vidhi* is the method of temple worship, and *bhāgavata-vidhi* is the system of nine processes which begin with hearing and chanting. The Kṛṣṇa conscious movement accepts both processes simultaneously and thus enables one to make steady progress on the path of realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This *pāñcarātrika* procedure was first introduced by the great sage Nārada, as referred to here by Vidura.

*sva-dharma-śīlaiḥ puruṣair  
bhagavān yajña-pūruṣaḥ  
ijyamāno bhaktimatā

### Synonyms

### Translation

**While all the Pracetās were executing religious rituals and sacrificial ceremonies and thus worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for His satisfaction, the great sage Nārada described the transcendental qualities of Dhruva Mahārāja.**

### Purport

Nārada Muni is always glorifying the pastimes of the Lord. In this verse we see that not only does he glorify the Lord, but he also likes to glorify the devotees of the Lord. The great sage Nārada’s mission is to broadcast the devotional service of the Lord. For this purpose he has compiled the *Nārada-pañcarātra,* a directory of devotional service, so that devotees can always take information about how to execute devotional service and thus engage twenty-four hours a day in performing sacrifices for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the Lord has created four orders of social life, namely *brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya* and *śūdra.* In the *Nārada-pañcarātra* it is very clearly described how each of the social orders can please the Supreme Lord. In the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.45) it is stated, *sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ:* by executing one’s prescribed duties one can please the Supreme Lord. In the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* (1.2.13) also it is stated, *svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam:* the perfection of duty is to see that by discharging one’s specific duties one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Pracetās were performing sacrifices according to this direction, Nārada Muni was satisfied to see these activities, and he also wanted to glorify Dhruva Mahārāja in that sacrificial arena.

### Purport

*Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* is the record of *bhagavat-kathā,* topics about the pastimes of the Lord. What Vidura was anxious to hear from Maitreya we can also hear five thousand years later, provided we are very eager.

### Translation

स जन्मनोपशान्तात्मा नि-सङ्ग- समदर्शन- ।

### Verse text

*sa janmanopaśāntātmā  
niḥsaṅgaḥ sama-darśanaḥ  
dadarśa loke vitatam  
ātmānaṁ lokam ātmani*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — his son Utkala; *janmanā* — from the very beginning of his birth; *upaśānta* — very well satisfied; *ātmā* — soul; *niḥsaṅgaḥ* — without attachment; *sama*-*darśanaḥ* — equipoised; *dadarśa* — saw; *loke* — in the world; *vitatam* — spread; *ātmānam* — the Supersoul; *lokam* — all the world; *ātmani* — in the Supersoul.

### Translation

**From his very birth, Utkala was fully satisfied and unattached to the world. He was equipoised, for he could see everything resting in the Supersoul and the Supersoul present in everyone’s heart.**

### Purport

The symptoms and characteristics of Utkala, the son of Mahārāja Dhruva, are those of a *mahā-bhāgavata.* As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (6.30), *yo māṁ paśyati sarvatra sarvaṁ ca mayi paśyati:* a highly advanced devotee sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere, and he also sees everything resting in the Supreme. It is also confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.4), *mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā:* Lord Kṛṣṇa is spread all over the universe in His impersonal feature. Everything is resting on Him, but that does not mean that everything is He Himself. A highly advanced *mahā-bhāgavata* devotee sees in this spirit: he sees the same Supersoul, Paramātmā, existing within everyone’s heart, regardless of discrimination based on the different material forms of the living entities. He sees everyone as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The *mahā-bhāgavata,* who experiences the Supreme Godhead’s presence everywhere, is never missing from the sight of the Supreme Lord, nor is the Supreme Lord ever lost from his sight. This is possible only when one is advanced in love of Godhead.

### Translation

**By expansion of his knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, he had already attained liberation from the bondage of the body. This liberation is known as nirvāṇa. He was situated in transcendental bliss, and he continued always in that blissful existence, which expanded more and more. This was possible for him by continual practice of bhakti-yoga, which is compared to fire because it burns away all dirty, material things. He was always situated in his constitutional position of self-realization, and he could not see anything else but the Supreme Lord and himself engaged in discharging devotional service.**

### Purport

These two verses explain the verse in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (18.54):

*brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā  
na śocati na kāṅkṣati  
samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu  
mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām*

“One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed towards every living entity. In that state he achieves pure devotional service unto Me.” This is also explained by Lord Caitanya in His *Śikṣāṣṭaka* in the beginning of the first verse:

*ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ  
śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam*

The *bhakti-yoga* system is the topmost *yoga* system, and in this system the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is the foremost performance of devotional service. By chanting the holy name one can attain the perfection of *nirvāṇa,* or liberation from material existence, and so increase one’s blissful life of spiritual existence as described by Lord Caitanya (*ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam*). When one is situated in that position, he no longer has any interest in material opulence or even a royal throne and sovereignty over the whole planet. This situation is called *viraktir anyatra syāt.* It is the result of devotional service.

The more one makes advancement in devotional service, the more one becomes detached from material opulence and material activity. This is the spiritual nature, full of bliss. This is also described in *Bhagavad-gītā* (2.59). *Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate:* one ceases to take part in material enjoyment upon tasting superior, blissful life in spiritual existence. By advancement in spiritual knowledge, which is considered to be like blazing fire, all material desires are burned to ashes. The perfection of mystic *yoga* is possible when one is continuously in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by discharging devotional service. A devotee is always thinking of the Supreme Person at every step of his life. Every conditioned soul is full of the reactions of his past life, but all dirty things are immediately burned to ashes if one simply executes devotional service. This is described in the *Nārada-pañcarātra: sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.*

*jaḍāndha-badhironmatta-  
mūkākṛtir atan-matiḥ  
lakṣitaḥ pathi bālānāṁ  
praśāntārcir ivānalaḥ*

### Synonyms

*jaḍa* — foolish; *andha* — blind; *badhira* — deaf; *unmatta* — mad; *mūka* — dumb; *ākṛtiḥ* — appearance; *a*-*tat* — not like that; *matiḥ* — his intelligence; *lakṣitaḥ* — he was seen; *pathi* — on the road; *bālānām* — by the less intelligent; *praśānta* — calmed; *arciḥ* — with flames; *iva* — like; *analaḥ* — fire.

### Translation

**Utkala appeared to the less intelligent persons on the road to be foolish, blind, dumb, deaf and mad, although actually he was not so. He remained like fire covered with ashes, without blazing flames.**

### Purport

In order to avoid contradiction, botheration and unfavorable situations created by materialistic persons, a great saintly person like Jaḍa Bharata or Utkala remains silent. The less intelligent consider such saintly persons to be mad, deaf or dumb. Factually, an advanced devotee avoids speaking with persons who are not in devotional life, but to those who are in devotional life he speaks in friendship, and he speaks to the innocent for their enlightenment. For all practical purposes, the whole world is full of nondevotees, and so one kind of very advanced devotee is called *bhajanānandī.* Those who are *goṣṭhy-ānandī,* however, preach to increase the number of devotees. But even such preachers also avoid opposing elements who are unfavorably disposed towards spiritual life.

### Verse text

*matvā taṁ jaḍam unmattaṁ  
kula-vṛddhāḥ samantriṇaḥ  
vatsaraṁ bhūpatiṁ cakrur  
yavīyāṁsaṁ bhrameḥ sutam*

### Synonyms

*matvā* — thinking; *tam* — Utkala; *jaḍam* — without intelligence; *unmattam* — mad; *kula*-*vṛddhāḥ* — the elderly members of the family; *samantriṇaḥ* — with the ministers; *vatsaram* — Vatsara; *bhū*-*patim* — ruler of the world; *cakruḥ* — they made; *yavīyāṁsam* — younger; *bhrameḥ* — of Bhrami; *sutam* — son.

### Translation

**For this reason the ministers and all the elderly members of the family thought Utkala to be without intelligence and, in fact, mad. Thus his younger brother, named Vatsara, the son of Bhrami, was elevated to the royal throne, and he became king of the world.**

### Purport

It appears that although there was monarchy, it was not at all an autocracy. There were senior family members and ministers who could make changes and elect the proper person to the throne, although the throne could be occupied only by the royal family. In modern days also, wherever there is monarchy, sometimes the ministers and elderly members of the family select one member from the royal family to occupy the throne in preference to another.

### Translation

**King Vatsara had a very dear wife whose name was Svarvīthi, and she gave birth to six sons, named Puṣpārṇa, Tigmaketu, Iṣa, Ūrja, Vasu and Jaya.**

### Purport

Vatsara’s wife is mentioned here as *iṣṭā,* which means “worshipable.” In other words, it appears that Vatsara’s wife had all good qualities; for example, she was always very faithful and obedient and affectionate to her husband. She had all good qualities for managing household affairs. If both the husband and wife are endowed with good qualities and live peacefully, then nice children take birth, and thus the whole family is happy and prosperous.

*arājake tadā loke

### Synonyms

*yam* — him (Vena) whom; *aṅga* — my dear Vidura; *śepuḥ* — they cursed; *kupitāḥ* — being angry; *vāk*-*vajrāḥ* — whose words are as strong as a thunderbolt; *munayaḥ* — great sages; *kila* — indeed; *gata*-*asoḥ* *tasya* — after he died; *bhūyaḥ* — moreover; *te* — they; *mamanthuḥ* — churned; *dakṣiṇam* — right; *karam* — hand; *arājake* — being without a king; *tadā* — then; *loke* — the world; *dasyubhiḥ* — by rogues and thieves; *pīḍitāḥ* — suffering; *prajāḥ* — all the citizens; *jātaḥ* — advented; *nārāyaṇa* — of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; *aṁśena* — by a partial representation; *pṛthuḥ* — Pṛthu; *ādyaḥ* — original; *kṣiti*-*īśvaraḥ* — ruler of the world.

### Translation

**My dear Vidura, when great sages curse, their words are as invincible as a thunderbolt. Thus when they cursed King Vena out of anger, he died. After his death, since there was no king, all the rogues and thieves flourished, the kingdom became unregulated, and all the citizens suffered greatly. On seeing this, the great sages took the right hand of Vena as a churning rod, and as a result of their churning, Lord Viṣṇu in His partial representation made His advent as King Pṛthu, the original emperor of the world.**

### Purport

Monarchy is better than democracy because if the monarchy is very strong the regulative principles within the kingdom are upheld very nicely. Even one hundred years ago in the state of Kashmir in India, the king was so strong that if a thief were arrested in his kingdom and brought before him, the king would immediately chop off the hands of the thief. As a result of this severe punishment there were practically no theft cases within the kingdom. Even if someone left something on the street, no one would touch it. The rule was that the things could be taken away only by the proprietor and that no one else would touch them. In the so-called democracy, wherever there is a theft case the police come and take note of the case, but generally the thief is never caught, nor is any punishment offered to him. As a result of incapable government, at the present moment thieves, rogues and cheaters are very prominent all over the world.

*tasya śīla-nidheḥ sādhor

### Synonyms

*viduraḥ* *uvāca* — Vidura said; *tasya* — of him (Aṅga); *śīla*-*nidheḥ* — reservoir of good characteristics; *sādhoḥ* — saintly person; *brahmaṇyasya* — lover of brahminical culture; *mahātmanaḥ* — great soul; *rājñaḥ* — of the king; *katham* — how; *abhūt* — it was; *duṣṭā* — bad; *prajā* — son; *yat* — by which; *vimanāḥ* — being indifferent; *yayau* — he left.

### Translation

**Vidura inquired from the sage Maitreya: My dear brāhmaṇa, King Aṅga was very gentle. He had high character and was a saintly personality and lover of brahminical culture. How is it that such a great soul got a bad son like Vena, because of whom he became indifferent to his kingdom and left it?**

### Purport

In family life a man is supposed to live happily with father, mother, wife and children, but sometimes, under certain conditions, a father, mother, child or wife becomes an enemy. It is said by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita that a father is an enemy when he is too much in debt, a mother is an enemy if she marries for a second time, a wife is an enemy when she is very beautiful, and a son is an enemy when he is a foolish rascal. In this way, when a family member becomes an enemy it is very difficult to live in family life or remain a householder. Generally such situations occur in the material world. Therefore according to Vedic culture one has to take leave of his family members just after his fiftieth year so that the balance of his life may be completely devoted in search of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

*kiṁ vāṁho vena uddiśya  
brahma-daṇḍam ayūyujan  
daṇḍa-vrata-dhare rājñi  
munayo dharma-kovidāḥ*

### Synonyms

*kim* — why; *vā* — also; *aṁhaḥ* — sinful activities; *vene* — unto Vena; *uddiśya* — seeing; *brahma*-*daṇḍam* — the curse of a *brāhmaṇa*; *ayūyujan* — they desired to award; *daṇḍa*-*vrata*-*dhare* — who carries the rod of punishment; *rājñi* — unto the king; *munayaḥ* — the great sages; *dharma*-*kovidāḥ* — completely conversant with religious principles.

### Translation

**Vidura also inquired: How is it that the great sages, who were completely conversant with religious principles, desired to curse King Vena, who himself carried the rod of punishment, and thus awarded him the greatest punishment \[brahma-śāpa\]?**

### Purport

It is understood that the king is able to give punishment to everyone, but in this case it appears that the great sages punished him. The king must have done something very serious; otherwise how could the great sages, who were supposed to be the greatest and most tolerant, still punish him in spite of their elevated religious consciousness? It appears also that the king was not independent of the brahminical culture. Above the king was the control of the *brāhmaṇas,* and if needed the *brāhmaṇas* would dethrone the king or kill him, not with any weapon, but with the *mantra* of a *brahma-śāpa.* The *brāhmaṇas* were so powerful that simply by their cursing one would immediately die.

prajābhir aghavān api

### Synonyms

*na* — never; *avadhyeyaḥ* — to be insulted; *prajā*-*pālaḥ* — the king; *prajābhiḥ* — by the citizens; *aghavān* — ever sinful; *api* — even though; *yat* — because; *asau* — he; *loka*-*pālānām* — of many kings; *bibharti* — maintains; *ojaḥ* — prowess; *sva*-*tejasā* — by personal influence.

### Translation

**It is the duty of all citizens in a state never to insult the king, even though he sometimes appears to have done something very sinful. Because of his prowess, the king is always more influential than all other ruling chiefs.**

### Purport

According to Vedic civilization the king is supposed to be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is called *nara-nārāyaṇa,* indicating that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in human society as the king. It is etiquette that neither a *brāhmaṇa* nor a *kṣatriya* king is ever insulted by the citizens; even though a king appears to be sinful, the citizens should not insult him. But in the case of Vena it appears that he was cursed by the *nara-devatās;* therefore, it was concluded that his sinful activities were very grievous.

### Translation

**Vidura requested Maitreya: My dear brāhmaṇa, you are well conversant with all subjects, both past and future. Therefore I wish to hear from you all the activities of King Vena. I am your faithful devotee, so please explain this.**

### Purport

Vidura accepted Maitreya as his spiritual master. A disciple always inquires from the spiritual master, and the spiritual master answers the question, provided the disciple is very gentle and devoted. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura said that by the mercy of the spiritual master one is blessed with the mercy of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master is not inclined to disclose all the secrets of transcendental science unless the disciple is very submissive and devoted. As stated in the *Bhagavad-gītā,* the process of receiving knowledge from the spiritual master entails submission, inquiry and service.

*aṅgo ’śvamedhaṁ rājarṣir

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* *uvāca* — Maitreya answered; *aṅgaḥ* — King Aṅga; *aśvamedham* — *aśvamedha* sacrifice; *rāja*-*ṛṣiḥ* — the saintly king; *ājahāra* — executed; *mahā*-*kratum* — great sacrifice; *na* — not; *ājagmuḥ* — came; *devatāḥ* — the demigods; *tasmin* — in that sacrifice; *āhūtāḥ* — being invited; *brahma*-*vādibhiḥ* — by the *brāhmaṇas* expert in executing sacrifices.

### Translation

**Śrī Maitreya replied: My dear Vidura, once the great King Aṅga arranged to perform the great sacrifice known as aśvamedha. All the expert brāhmaṇas present knew how to invite the demigods, but in spite of their efforts, no demigods participated or appeared in that sacrifice.**

### Purport

A Vedic sacrifice is not an ordinary performance. The demigods used to participate in such sacrifices, and the animals sacrificed in such performances were reincarnated with new life. In this Age of Kali there are no powerful *brāhmaṇas* who can invite the demigods or give renewed life to animals. Formerly, the *brāhmaṇas* well conversant in Vedic *mantras* could show the potency of the *mantras,* but in this age, because there are no such *brāhmaṇas,* all such sacrifices are forbidden. The sacrifice in which horses were offered was called *aśvamedha.* Sometimes cows were sacrificed (*gavālambha*), not for eating purposes, but to give them new life in order to show the potency of the *mantra.* In this age, therefore, the only practical *yajña* is *saṅkīrtana-yajña,* or chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* twenty-four hours a day.

*rājan* — O King; *havīṁṣi* — sacrificial offerings; *aduṣṭāni* — not polluted; *śraddhayā* — with great faith and care; *āsāditāni* — collected; *te* — your; *chandāṁsi* — the *mantras*; *ayāta*-*yāmāni* — not deficient; *yojitāni* — properly executed; *dhṛta*-*vrataiḥ* — by qualified *brāhmaṇas.*.

### Translation

**O King, we know that the paraphernalia to perform the sacrifice is well collected by you with great faith and care and is not polluted. Our chanting of the Vedic hymns is also not deficient in any way, for all the brāhmaṇas and priests present here are expert and are executing the performances properly.**

### Purport

It is the practice of the *brāhmaṇas* conversant with the science to pronounce a Vedic *mantra* in the right accent. The combination of the *mantra* and Sanskrit words must be chanted with the right pronunciation; otherwise it will not be successful. In this age the *brāhmaṇas* are neither well versed in the Sanskrit language nor very pure in practical life. But by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* one can attain the highest benefit of sacrificial performances. Even if the Hare Kṛṣṇa *mantra* is not chanted properly, it still has so much potency that the chanter gains the effect.

### Synonyms

*na* — not; *vidāma* — can find; *iha* — in this connection; *devānām* — of the demigods; *helanam* — insult, neglect; *vayam* — we; *aṇu* — minute; *api* — even; *yat* — because of which; *na* — not; *gṛhṇanti* — accept; *bhāgān* — shares; *svān* — own; *ye* — who; *devāḥ* — the demigods; *karma*-*sākṣiṇaḥ* — witnesses for the sacrifice.

### Translation

**Dear King, we do not find any reason that the demigods should feel insulted or neglected in any way, but still the demigods who are witnesses for the sacrifice do not accept their shares. We do not know why this is so.**

### Purport

It is indicated herein that if there is negligence on the part of the priest, the demigods do not accept their share in sacrifices. Similarly, in devotional service there are offenses known as *sevā-aparādha.* Those who are engaged in worshiping the Deity, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, in the temple, should avoid such offenses in service. The offenses in service are described in *The Nectar of Devotion.* If we simply make a show of offering services to the Deity but do not care for the *sevā-aparādha,* certainly the Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity will not accept offerings from such nondevotees. Devotees engaged in temple worship should therefore not manufacture their own methods but should strictly follow the regulative principles of cleanliness, and then offerings will be accepted.

### Translation

**The head priests said: O King, in this life we do not find any sinful activity, even within your mind, so you are not in the least offensive. But we can see that in your previous life you performed sinful activities due to which, in spite of your having all qualifications, you have no son.**

### Purport

The purpose of marrying is to beget a son, because a son is necessary to deliver his father and forefathers from any hellish conditional life in which they may be. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita therefore says, *putra-hīnaṁ gṛhaṁ śūnyam:* without a son, married life is simply abominable. King Aṅga was a very pious king in this life, but because of his previous sinful activity he could not get a son. It is concluded, therefore, that if a person does not get a son it is due to his past sinful life.

### Translation

**When Hari, the supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices, is invited to fulfill your desire for a son, all the demigods will come with Him and take their shares in the sacrifice.**

Whenever a sacrifice is performed, it is meant for satisfying Lord Viṣṇu, the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifices; and when Lord Viṣṇu agrees to come to a sacrificial arena, all the demigods naturally follow their master, and their shares are offered in such sacrifices. The conclusion is that the sacrifices performed are meant for Lord Viṣṇu, not for the demigods.

### Translation

**The performer of the sacrifices \[under karma-kāṇḍa activities\] achieves the fulfillment of the desire for which he worships the Lord.**

### Purport

In the *Bhagavad-gītā* the Lord says that He awards benedictions to the worshiper according to his desire. The Supreme Personality of Godhead gives all living entities conditioned within this material world full freedom to act in their own way. But to His devotee He says that instead of working in that way, it is better to surrender unto Him, for He will take charge of the devotee. That is the difference between a devotee and a fruitive actor. The fruitive actor enjoys only the fruits of his own activities, but a devotee, being under the guidance of the Supreme Lord, simply advances in devotional service to achieve the ultimate goal of life — to go back home, back to Godhead. The significant word in this verse is *kāmān,* which means “sense gratificatory desires.” A devotee is devoid of all *kāmān.* He is *anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya:* a devotee is always devoid of all desires for sense gratification. His only aim is to satisfy or gratify the senses of the Lord. That is the difference between a *karmī* and a devotee.

### Translation

**Thus for the sake of a son for King Aṅga, they decided to offer oblations to Lord Viṣṇu, who is situated in the hearts of all living entities.**

### Purport

According to sacrificial rituals, animals are sometimes sacrificed in the *yajña* arena. Such animals are sacrificed not to kill them but to give them new life. Such action was an experiment to observe whether the Vedic *mantras* were being properly pronounced. Sometimes small animals are killed in a medical laboratory to investigate therapeutic effects. In a medical clinic, the animals are not revived, but in the *yajña* arena, when animals were sacrificed, they were again given life by the potency of Vedic *mantras.* The word *śipi-viṣṭāya* appears in this verse. *Śipi* means “the flames of the sacrifice.” In the sacrificial fire if the oblations are offered into the flames, then Lord Viṣṇu is situated there in the form of the flames. Therefore Lord Viṣṇu is known as Śipiviṣṭa.

**The King was very liberal, and after taking permission from the priests, he took the preparation in his joined palms, and after smelling it he offered a portion to his wife.**

### Purport

The word *udāra-dhīḥ* is significant in this connection. The wife of the King, Sunīthā, was not fit to accept this benediction, yet the King was so liberal that without hesitation he offered to his wife the boiled rice in milk *prasāda* received from the *yajña-puruṣa.* Of course, everything is designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As will be explained in later verses, this incident was not very favorable for the King. Since the King was very liberal, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in order to increase his detachment from this material world, willed that a cruel son be born of the Queen so that the King would have to leave home. As stated above, Lord Viṣṇu fulfills the desires of the *karmīs* as they desire, but the Lord fulfills the desire of a devotee in a different way so that the devotee may gradually come to Him. This is confirmed in the *Bhagavad-gītā* (*dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te*). The Lord gives the devotee the opportunity to make progress further and further so that he may come back home, back to Godhead.

स बाल एव पुरुषो मातामहमनुव्रत- ।

### Verse text

*sa bāla eva puruṣo  
mātāmaham anuvrataḥ  
adharmāṁśodbhavaṁ mṛtyuṁ  
tenābhavad adhārmikaḥ*

### Synonyms

*saḥ* — that; *bālaḥ* — child; *eva* — certainly; *puruṣaḥ* — male; *mātā*-*maham* — maternal grandfather; *anuvrataḥ* — a follower of; *adharma* — of irreligion; *aṁśa* — from a portion; *udbhavam* — who appeared; *mṛtyum* — death; *tena* — by this; *abhavat* — he became; *adhārmikaḥ* — irreligious.

### Translation

**That boy was born partially in the dynasty of irreligion. His grandfather was death personified, and the boy grew up as his follower; he became a greatly irreligious person.**

### Purport

The child’s mother, Sunīthā, was the daughter of death personified. Generally the daughter receives the qualifications of her father, and the son acquires those of the mother. So, according to the axiomatic truth that things equal to the same thing are equal to one another, the child born of King Aṅga became the follower of his maternal grandfather. According to *smṛti-śāstra,* a child generally follows the principles of his maternal uncle’s house. *Narāṇāṁ mātula-karma* means that a child generally follows the qualities of his maternal family. If the maternal family is very corrupt or sinful, the child, even though born of a good father, becomes a victim of the maternal family. According to Vedic civilization, therefore, before the marriage takes place an account is taken of both the boy’s and girl’s families. If according to astrological calculation the combination is perfect, then marriage takes place. Sometimes, however, there is a mistake, and family life becomes frustrating.

It appears that King Aṅga did not get a very good wife in Sunīthā because she was the daughter of death personified. Sometimes the Lord arranges an unfortunate wife for His devotee so that gradually, due to family circumstances, the devotee becomes detached from his wife and home and makes progress in devotional life. It appears that by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Aṅga, although a pious devotee, got an unfortunate wife like Sunīthā and later on a bad child like Vena. But the result was that he got complete freedom from the entanglement of family life and left home to go back to Godhead.

### Translation

**After fixing his bow and arrow, the cruel boy used to go to the forest and unnecessarily kill innocent deer, and as soon as he came all the people would cry, “Here comes cruel Vena! Here comes cruel Vena!”**

### Purport

*Kṣatriyas* are allowed to hunt in the forest for the purpose of learning the killing art, not to kill animals for eating or for any other purpose. The *kṣatriya* kings were sometimes expected to cut off the head of a culprit in the state. For this reason the *kṣatriyas* were allowed to hunt in the forest. Because this son of King Aṅga, Vena, was born of a bad mother, he was very cruel, and he used to go to the forest and unnecessarily kill the animals. All the neighboring inhabitants would be frightened by his presence, and they would call, “Here comes Vena! Here comes Vena!” So from the beginning of his life he was fearful to the citizens.

### Translation

**The King thought to himself: Persons who have no son are certainly fortunate. They must have worshiped the Lord in their previous lives so that they would not have to suffer the unbearable unhappiness caused by a bad son.**

### Purport

It is said that a married couple must have a son, otherwise their family life is void. But a son born without good qualities is as good as a blind eye. A blind eye has no use for seeing, but it is simply unbearably painful. The King therefore thought himself very unfortunate to have such a bad son.

*kad*-*apatyam* — bad son; *varam* — better; *manye* — I think; *sat*-*apatyāt* — than a good son; *śucām* — of grief; *padāt* — the source; *nirvidyeta* — becomes detached; *gṛhāt* — from home; *martyaḥ* — a mortal man; *yat* — because of whom; *kleśa*-*nivahāḥ* — hellish; *gṛhāḥ* — home.

### Translation

**Then the King thought: A bad son is better than a good son because a good son creates an attachment for home, whereas a bad son does not. A bad son creates a hellish home from which an intelligent man naturally becomes very easily detached.**

### Purport

The King began to think in terms of attachment and detachment from one’s material home. According to Prahlāda Mahārāja, the material home is compared to a blind well. If a man falls down into a blind well, it is very difficult to get out of it and begin life again. Prahlāda Mahārāja has advised that one give up this blind well of home life as soon as possible and go to the forest to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Vedic civilization, this giving up of home by *vānaprastha* and *sannyāsa* is compulsory. But people are so attached to their homes that even up to the point of death they do not like to retire from home life. King Aṅga, therefore, thinking in terms of detachment, accepted his bad son as a good impetus for detachment from home life. He therefore considered his bad son his friend since he was helping him become detached from his home. Ultimately one has to learn how to detach oneself from attachment to material life; therefore if a bad son, by his bad behavior, helps a householder to go away from home, it is a boon.

### Translation

**Thinking like that, King Aṅga could not sleep at night. He became completely indifferent to household life. Once, therefore, in the dead of night, he got up from bed and left Vena’s mother \[his wife\], who was sleeping deeply. He gave up all attraction for his greatly opulent kingdom, and, unseen by anyone, he very silently gave up his home and opulence and proceeded towards the forest.**

### Purport

In this verse the word *mahodayodayāt* indicates that by the blessings of a great soul one becomes materially opulent, but when one gives up attachment to material wealth, that should be considered an even greater blessing from the great souls. It was not a very easy task for the King to give up his opulent kingdom and young, faithful wife, but it was certainly a great blessing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he could give up the attachment and go out to the forest without being seen by anyone. There are many instances of great souls leaving home in this way in the dead of night, giving up attachment for home, wife and money.

### Translation

**When it was understood that the King had indifferently left home, all the citizens, priests, ministers, friends, and people in general were greatly aggrieved. They began to search for him all over the world, just as a less experienced mystic searches out the Supersoul within himself.**

### Purport

The example of searching for the Supersoul within the heart by the less intelligent mystics is very instructive. The Absolute Truth is understood in three different features, namely impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such *kuyoginaḥ,* or less intelligent mystics, can by mental speculation reach the point of the impersonal Brahman, but they cannot find the Supersoul, who is sitting within each living entity. When the King left, it was certain that he was staying somewhere else, but because the citizens did not know how to find him they were frustrated like the less intelligent mystics.
