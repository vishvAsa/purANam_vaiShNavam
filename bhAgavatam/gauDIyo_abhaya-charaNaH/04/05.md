मैत्रेय उवाच  
भवो भवान्या निधनं प्रजापते-  
रसत्कृताया अवगम्य नारदात् ।  
स्वपार्षदसैन्यं च तदध्वरर्भुभि-

### Verse text

maitreya uvāca  
*bhavo bhavānyā nidhanaṁ prajāpater  
asat-kṛtāyā avagamya nāradāt  
sva-pārṣada-sainyaṁ ca tad-adhvararbhubhir  
vidrāvitaṁ krodham apāram ādadhe*

### Synonyms

*maitreyaḥ* *uvāca* — Maitreya said; *bhavaḥ* — Lord Śiva; *bhavānyāḥ* — of Satī; *nidhanam* — the death; *prajāpateḥ* — because of Prajāpati Dakṣa; *asat*-*kṛtāyāḥ* — having been insulted; *avagamya* — hearing about; *nāradāt* — from Nārada; *sva*-*pārṣada*-*sainyam* — the soldiers of his own associates; *ca* — and; *tat*-*adhvara* — (produced from) his (Dakṣa’s) sacrifice; *ṛbhubhiḥ* — by the Ṛbhus; *vidrāvitam* — were driven away; *krodham* — anger; *apāram* — unbounded; *ādadhe* — showed.

### Translation

**Maitreya said: When Lord Śiva heard from Nārada that Satī, his wife, was now dead because of Prajāpati Dakṣa’s insult to her and that his soldiers had been driven away by the Ṛbhu demigods, he became greatly angry.**

### Purport

Lord Śiva understood that Satī, being the youngest daughter of Dakṣa, could present the case of Lord Śiva’s purity of purpose and would thus be able to mitigate the misunderstanding between Dakṣa and himself. But such a compromise was not attained, and Satī was deliberately insulted by her father by not being received properly when she visited his house without being invited. Satī herself could have killed her father, Dakṣa, because she is the personified material energy and has immense power to kill and create within this material universe. In the *Brahma-saṁhitā* her strength is described: she is capable of creating and dissolving many universes. But although she is so powerful, she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as His shadow. It would not have been difficult for Satī to punish her father, but she thought that since she was his daughter, it was not proper for her to kill him. Thus she decided to give up her own body, which she had obtained from his, and Dakṣa did not even check her.

When Satī passed away, giving up her body, the news was conveyed by Nārada to Lord Śiva. Nārada always carries the news of such events because he knows their import. When Lord Śiva heard that his chaste wife, Satī, was dead, he naturally became exceedingly angry. He also understood that Bhṛgu Muni had created the Ṛbhudeva demigods by uttering the *mantras* of the *Yajur Veda* and that these demigods had driven away all of his soldiers who were present in the arena of sacrifice. Therefore he wanted to reply to this insult, and thus he decided to kill Dakṣa because he was the cause of the death of Satī.

*taṁ kiṁ karomīti gṛṇantam āha  
baddhāñjaliṁ bhagavān bhūta-nāthaḥ  
dakṣaṁ sa-yajñaṁ jahi mad-bhaṭānāṁ

### Translation

**When that gigantic demon asked with folded hands, “What shall I do, my lord?” Lord Śiva, who is known as Bhūtanātha, directly ordered, “Because you are born from my body, you are the chief of all my associates. Therefore, kill Dakṣa and his soldiers at the sacrifice.”**

### Purport

Here is the beginning of competition between *brahma-tejas* and *śiva-tejas.* By *brahma-tejas,* brahminical strength, Bhṛgu Muni had created the Ṛbhu demigods, who had driven away the soldiers of Lord Śiva stationed in the arena. When Lord Śiva heard that his soldiers had been driven away, he created the tall black demon Vīrabhadra to retaliate. There is sometimes a competition between the mode of goodness and the mode of ignorance. That is the way of material existence. Even when one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is every possibility that his position will be mixed with or attacked by the mode of passion or ignorance. That is the law of material nature. Although pure goodness, or *śuddha-sattva,* is the basic principle in the spiritual world, pure manifestation of goodness is not possible in this material world. Thus, the struggle for existence between different material qualities is always present. This quarrel between Lord Śiva and Bhṛgu Muni, centering around Prajāpati Dakṣa, is the practical example of such competition between the different qualitative modes of material nature.

### Translation

**Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, that black person was the personified anger of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he was prepared to execute the orders of Lord Śiva. Thus, considering himself capable of coping with any power offered against him, he circumambulated Lord Śiva.**

### Translation

### Verse text

*vātā na vānti na hi santi dasyavaḥ  
prācīna-barhir jīvati hogra-daṇḍaḥ  
gāvo na kālyanta idaṁ kuto rajo  
loko ’dhunā kiṁ pralayāya kalpate*

### Synonyms

*vātāḥ* — the winds; *na* *vānti* — are not blowing; *na* — not; *hi* — because; *santi* — are possible; *dasyavaḥ* — plunderers; *prācīna*-*barhiḥ* — old King Barhi; *jīvati* — is living; *ha* — still; *ugra*-*daṇḍaḥ* — who would sternly punish; *gāvaḥ* — the cows; *na* *kālyante* — are not being driven; *idam* — this; *kutaḥ* — from where; *rajaḥ* — dust; *lokaḥ* — the planet; *adhunā* — now; *kim* — is it; *pralayāya* — for dissolution; *kalpate* — to be considered ready.

### Translation

**Conjecturing on the origin of the storm, they said: There is no wind blowing, and no cows are passing, nor is it possible that this dust storm could be raised by plunderers, for there is still the strong King Barhi, who would punish them. Where is this dust storm blowing from? Is the dissolution of the planet now to occur?**

### Purport

Specifically significant in this verse is *prācīna-barhir jīvati.* The king of that part of the land was known as Barhi, and although he was old, he was still living, and he was a very strong ruler. Thus there was no possibility of an invasion by thieves and plunderers. Indirectly it is stated here that thieves, plunderers, rogues and unwanted population can exist only in a state or kingdom where there is no strong ruler. When, in the name of justice, thieves are allowed liberty, the state and kingdom are disturbed by such plunderers and unwanted population. The dust storm created by the soldiers and assistants of Lord Śiva resembled the situation at the time of the dissolution of this world. When there is a need for the dissolution of the material creation, this function is conducted by Lord Śiva. Therefore the situation now created by him resembled the dissolution of the cosmic manifestation.

### Synonyms

*prasūti*-*miśrāḥ* — headed by Prasūti; *striyaḥ* — the women; *udvigna*-*cittāḥ* — being very anxious; *ūcuḥ* — said; *vipākaḥ* — the resultant danger; *vṛjinasya* — of the sinful activity; *eva* — indeed; *tasya* — his (Dakṣa’s); *yat* — because; *paśyantīnām* — who were looking on; *duhitṝṇām* — of her sisters; *prajeśaḥ* — the lord of the created beings (Dakṣa); *sutām* — his daughter; *satīm* — Satī; *avadadhyau* — insulted; *anāgām* — completely innocent.

### Translation

**Prasūti, the wife of Dakṣa, along with the other women assembled, became very anxious and said: This danger has been created by Dakṣa because of the death of Satī, who, even though completely innocent, quit her body as her sisters looked on.**

### Purport

Prasūti, being a softhearted woman, could immediately understand that the imminent danger approaching was due to the impious activity of hardhearted Prajāpati Dakṣa. He was so cruel that he would not save her youngest daughter, Satī, from the act of committing suicide in the presence of her sisters. Satī’s mother could understand how much Satī had been pained by the insult of her father. Satī had been present along with the other daughters, and Dakṣa had purposely received all of them but her because she happened to be the wife of Lord Śiva. This consideration convinced the wife of Dakṣa of the danger which was now ahead, and thus she knew that Dakṣa must be prepared to die for his heinous act.

### Translation

**At the time of dissolution, Lord Śiva’s hair is scattered, and he pierces the rulers of the different directions with his trident. He laughs and dances proudly, scattering their hands like flags, as thunder scatters the clouds all over the world.**

### Purport

Prasūti, who appreciated the power and strength of her son-in-law, Lord Śiva, is describing what he does at the time of dissolution. This description indicates that the strength of Lord Śiva is so great that Dakṣa’s power could not be set in comparison to it. At the time of dissolution, Lord Śiva, with his trident in hand, dances over the rulers of the different planets, and his hair is scattered, just as the clouds are scattered over all directions in order to plunge the different planets into incessant torrents of rain. In the last phase of dissolution, all the planets become inundated with water, and that inundation is caused by the dancing of Lord Śiva. This dance is called the *pralaya* dance, or dance of dissolution. Prasūti could understand that the dangers ahead resulted not only from Dakṣa’s having neglected her daughter, but also because of his neglecting the prestige and honor of Lord Śiva.

### Translation

**While all the people talked amongst themselves, Dakṣa saw dangerous omens from all sides, from the earth and from the sky.**

### Purport

In this verse Dakṣa has been described as *mahātmā.* The word *mahātmā* has been commented upon by different commentators in various manners. Vīrarāghava Ācārya has indicated that this word *mahātmā* means “steady in heart.” That is to say that Dakṣa was so stronghearted that even when his beloved daughter was prepared to lay down her life, he was steady and unshaken. But in spite of his being so stronghearted, he was perturbed when he saw the various disturbances created by the gigantic black demon. Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks in this connection that even if one is called *mahātmā,* a great soul, unless he exhibits the symptoms of a *mahātmā,* he should be considered a *durātmā,* or a degraded soul. In *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.13) the word *mahātmā* describes the pure devotee of the Lord: *mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ.* A *mahātmā* is always under the guidance of the internal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus how could such a misbehaved person as Dakṣa be a *mahātmā*? A *mahātmā* is supposed to have all the good qualities of the demigods, and thus Dakṣa, lacking those qualities, could not be called a *mahātmā;* he should instead be called *durātmā,* a degraded soul. The word *mahātmā* to describe the qualifications of Dakṣa is used sarcastically.

They ran all around the sacrificial arena and thus began to create disturbances.**

### Purport

Here a reference is made to the marriage of Aniruddha, a grandson of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s. He kidnapped the daughter of Dantavakra, and thereafter he was arrested. Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping, the soldiers from Dvārakā arrived, headed by Balarāma, and a fight ensued amongst the *kṣatriyas.* This sort of fight was very common, especially during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a challenging spirit. In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights there was commonly killing and misfortune. After finishing such fighting, the parties would come to a compromise, and everything would be settled. This Dakṣa *yajña* was similar to such events. Now all of them — Dakṣa and the demigods Bhaga and Pūṣā and Bhṛgu Muni — were punished by the soldiers of Lord Śiva, but later everything would come to a peaceful end. So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly inimical. Because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength by Vedic *mantra* or mystic power, all these fighting skills were very elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Dakṣa *yajña.*

### Translation

**Then Vīrabhadra saw the wooden device in the sacrificial arena by which the animals were to have been killed. He took the opportunity of this facility to behead Dakṣa.**

### Purport

In this connection it is to be noted that the device used for killing animals in the sacrifice was not designed to facilitate eating their flesh. The killing was specifically intended to give a new life to the sacrificed animal by the power of Vedic *mantra.* The animals were sacrificed to test the strength of Vedic *mantras;* *yajñas* were performed as a test of the *mantra.* Even in the modern age, tests are executed on animal bodies in the physiology laboratory. Similarly, whether or not the *brāhmaṇas* were uttering the Vedic hymns correctly was tested by sacrifice in the arena. On the whole, the animals thus sacrificed were not at all the losers. Some old animals would be sacrificed, but in exchange for their old bodies they received other, new bodies. That was the test of Vedic *mantras.* Vīrabhadra, instead of sacrificing animals with the wooden device, immediately beheaded Dakṣa, to the astonishment of everyone.
