maitreya uvāca  
*manos tu śatarūpāyāṁ  
tisraḥ kanyāś ca jajñire  
ākūtir devahūtiś ca

### Translation

**Śrī Maitreya said: Svāyambhuva Manu begot three daughters in his wife, Śatarūpā, and their names were Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti.**

### Purport

First of all let us offer our respectful obeisances unto our spiritual master, Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, by whose order I am engaged in this herculean task of writing commentary on the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* as the Bhaktivedanta purports. By his grace we have finished three cantos already, and we are just trying to begin the Fourth Canto. By his divine grace let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya, who began this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of *Bhāgavata-dharma* five hundred years ago, and through His grace let us offer our obeisances to the Six Gosvāmīs, and then let us offer our obeisances to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, the spiritual couple who enjoy eternally in Vṛndāvana with Their cowherd boys and damsels in Vrajabhūmi. Let us also offer our respectful obeisances to all the devotees and eternal servitors of the Supreme Lord.

In this Fourth Canto of *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* there are thirty-one chapters, and all these chapters describe the secondary creation by Brahmā and the Manus. The Supreme Lord Himself does the real creation by agitating His material energy, and then, by His order, Brahmā, the first living creature in the universe, attempts to create the different planetary systems and their inhabitants, expanding the population through his progeny, like Manu and other progenitors of living entities, who work perpetually under the order of the Supreme Lord. In the First Chapter of this Fourth Canto there are descriptions of the three daughters of Svāyambhuva Manu and their descendants. The next six chapters describe the sacrifice performed by King Dakṣa and how it was spoiled. Thereafter the activities of Mahārāja Dhruva are described in five chapters. Then, in eleven chapters, the activities of King Pṛthu are described, and the next eight chapters are devoted to the activities of the Pracetā kings.

As described in the first verse of this chapter, Svāyambhuva Manu had three daughters, named Ākūti, Devahūti and Prasūti. Of these three daughters, one daughter, Devahūti, has already been described, along with her husband, Kardama Muni, and her son, Kapila Muni. In this chapter the descendants of the first daughter, Ākūti, will specifically be described. Svāyambhuva Manu was the son of Brahmā. Brahmā had many other sons, but Manu’s name is specifically mentioned first because he was a great devotee of the Lord. In this verse there is also the word *ca,* indicating that besides the three daughters mentioned, Svāyambhuva Manu also had two sons.

आकूतिं रुचये प्रादादपि भ्रातृमतीं नृप- ।  
पुत्रिकाधर्ममाश्रित्य शतरूपानुमोदित- ॥ २ ॥

### Verse text

*ākūtiṁ rucaye prādād  
api bhrātṛmatīṁ nṛpaḥ  
putrikā-dharmam āśritya  
śatarūpānumoditaḥ*

### Synonyms

*ākūtim* — Ākūti; *rucaye* — unto the great sage Ruci; *prādāt* — handed over; *api* — although; *bhrātṛ*-*matīm* — daughter having a brother; *nṛpaḥ* — the King; *putrikā* — get the resultant son; *dharmam* — religious rites; *āśritya* — taking shelter; *śatarūpā* — by the wife of Svāyambhuva Manu; *anumoditaḥ* — being sanctioned.

### Translation

**Ākūti had two brothers, but in spite of her brothers, King Svāyambhuva Manu handed her over to Prajāpati Ruci on the condition that the son born of her be returned to Manu as his son. This he did in consultation with his wife, Śatarūpā.**

### Purport

Sometimes a sonless person offers his daughter to a husband on the condition that his grandson be returned to him to be adopted as his son and inherit his property. This is called *putrikā-dharma,* which means that by execution of religious rituals one gets a son, although one is sonless by one’s own wife. But here we see extraordinary behavior in Manu, for in spite of his having two sons, he handed over his first daughter to Prajāpati Ruci on the condition that the son born of his daughter be returned to him as his son. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura comments in this connection that King Manu knew that the Supreme Personality of Godhead would take birth in the womb of Ākūti; therefore, in spite of having two sons, he wanted the particular son born of Ākūti because he was ambitious to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear as his son and grandson. Manu is the lawgiver of mankind, and since he personally executed the *putrikā-dharma,* we may accept that such a system may be adopted by mankind also. Thus, even though one has a son, if one wants to have a particular son from one’s daughter, one may give one’s daughter in charity on that condition. That is the opinion of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī.

प्रजापति- स भगवान् रुचिस्तस्यामजीजनत् ।  
मिथुनं ब्रह्मवर्चस्वी परमेण समाधिना ॥ ३ ॥

### Verse text

*prajāpatiḥ sa bhagavān  
rucis tasyām ajījanat  
mithunaṁ brahma-varcasvī  
parameṇa samādhinā*

### Synonyms

*prajāpatiḥ* — one who is entrusted with begetting children; *saḥ* — he; *bhagavān* — the most opulent; *ruciḥ* — the great sage Ruci; *tasyām* — in her; *ajījanat* — gave birth; *mithunam* — couple; *brahma*-*varcasvī* — spiritually very much powerful; *parameṇa* — with great strength; *samādhinā* — in trance.

### Translation

**Ruci, who was very powerful in his brahminical qualifications and was appointed one of the progenitors of the living entities, begot one son and one daughter by his wife, Ākūti.**

### Purport

The word *brahma-varcasvī* is very significant. Ruci was a *brāhmaṇa,* and he executed the brahminical duties very rigidly. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā,* the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses, control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge, simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as *brahma-varcasvī.* One who is born of a *brāhmaṇa* father but does not act as a *brāhmaṇa* is called, in Vedic language, a *brahma-bandhu,* and is calculated to be on the level of *śūdras* and women. Thus in the *Bhāgavatam* we find that *Mahābhārata* was specifically compiled by Vyāsadeva for *strī-śūdra-brahma-bandhu.* *Strī* means women, *śūdra* means the lower class of civilized human society, and *brahma-bandhu* means persons who are born in the families of *brāhmaṇas* but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent; they have no access to the study of the *Vedas,* which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired the brahminical qualifications. This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon qualification. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam* and other *Purāṇas,* for such persons cannot deliver their real message. Ruci was considered a first-class *brāhmaṇa;* therefore he is mentioned here as *brahma-varcasvī,* one who had full prowess in brahminical strength.

यस्तयो- पुरुष- साक्षाद्विष्णुर्यज्ञस्वरूपधृक् ।  
या स्त्री सा दक्षिणा भूतेरंशभूतानपायिनी ॥ ४ ॥

### Verse text

*yas tayoḥ puruṣaḥ sākṣād  
viṣṇur yajña-svarūpa-dhṛk  
yā strī sā dakṣiṇā bhūter  
aṁśa-bhūtānapāyinī*

### Synonyms

*yaḥ* — one who; *tayoḥ* — out of them; *puruṣaḥ* — male; *sākṣāt* — directly; *viṣṇuḥ* — the Supreme Lord; *yajña* — Yajña; *svarūpa*-*dhṛk* — accepting the form; *yā* — the other; *strī* — female; *sā* — she; *dakṣiṇā* — Dakṣiṇā; *bhūteḥ* — of the goddess of fortune; *aṁśa*-*bhūtā* — being a plenary expansion; *anapāyinī* — never to be separated.

### Translation

**Of the two children born of Ākūti, the male child was directly an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His name was Yajña, which is another name of Lord Viṣṇu. The female child was a partial incarnation of Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, the eternal consort of Lord Viṣṇu.**

### Purport

Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, is the eternal consort of Lord Viṣṇu. Here it is stated that both the Lord and Lakṣmī, who are eternal consorts, appeared from Ākūti simultaneously. Both the Lord and His consort are beyond this material creation, as confirmed by many authorities (*nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt*); therefore their eternal relationship cannot be changed, and Yajña, the boy born of Ākūti, later married the goddess of fortune.

आनिन्ये स्वगृहं पुत्र्या- पुत्रं विततरोचिषम् ।  
स्वायम्भुवो मुदा युक्तो रुचिर्जग्राह दक्षिणाम् ॥ ५ ॥

### Verse text

*āninye sva-gṛhaṁ putryāḥ  
putraṁ vitata-rociṣam  
svāyambhuvo mudā yukto  
rucir jagrāha dakṣiṇām*

### Synonyms

*āninye* — brought to; *sva*-*gṛham* — home; *putryāḥ* — born of the daughter; *putram* — the son; *vitata*-*rociṣam* — very powerful; *svāyambhuvaḥ* — the Manu named Svāyambhuva; *mudā* — being very pleased; *yuktaḥ* — with; *ruciḥ* — the great sage Ruci; *jagrāha* — kept; *dakṣiṇām* — the daughter named Dakṣiṇā.

### Translation

**Svāyambhuva Manu very gladly brought home the beautiful boy named Yajña, and Ruci, his son-in-law, kept with him the daughter, Dakṣiṇā.**

### Purport

Svāyambhuva Manu was very glad to see that his daughter Ākūti had given birth to both a boy and girl. He was afraid that he would take one son and that because of this his son-in-law Ruci might be sorry. Thus when he heard that a daughter was born along with the boy, he was very glad. Ruci, according to his promise, returned his male child to Svāyambhuva Manu and decided to keep the daughter, whose name was Dakṣiṇā. One of Lord Viṣṇu’s names is Yajña because He is the master of the *Vedas.* The name Yajña comes from *yajuṣāṁ patiḥ,* which means “Lord of all sacrifices.” In the *Yajur Veda* there are different ritualistic prescriptions for performing *yajñas,* and the beneficiary of all such *yajñas* is the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. Therefore it is stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (3.9), *yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ:* one should act, but one should perform one’s prescribed duties only for the sake of Yajña, or Viṣṇu. lf one does not act for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be reactions to all one’s activities. It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our activities are not dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we do not act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we shall be responsible for the results of all our activities. There is always a reaction to every kind of action, but if actions are performed for Yajña, there is no reaction. Thus if one acts for Yajña, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is not entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the *Vedas* and also in *Bhagavad-gītā* that the *Vedas* and the Vedic rituals are all meant for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. From the very beginning one should try to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; that will free one from the reactions of material activities.

तां कामयानां भगवानुवाह यजुषां पति- ।

### Verse text

*tāṁ kāmayānāṁ bhagavān  
uvāha yajuṣāṁ patiḥ  
tuṣṭāyāṁ toṣam āpanno  
’janayad dvādaśātmajān*

### Synonyms

*tām* — her; *kāmayānām* — desiring; *bhagavān* — the Lord; *uvāha* — married; *yajuṣām* — of all sacrifices; *patiḥ* — master; *tuṣṭāyām* — in His wife, who was very much pleased; *toṣam* — great pleasure; *āpannaḥ* — having obtained; *ajanayat* — gave birth; *dvādaśa* — twelve; *ātmajān* — sons.

### Translation

**The Lord of the ritualistic performance of yajña later married Dakṣiṇā, who was anxious to have the Personality of Godhead as her husband, and in this wife the Lord was also very much pleased to beget twelve children.**

### Purport

An ideal husband and wife are generally called Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa to compare them to the Lord and the goddess of fortune, for it is significant that Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa are forever happy as husband and wife. A wife should always remain satisfied with her husband, and a husband should always remain satisfied with his wife. In the *Cāṇakya-śloka,* the moral instructions of Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, it is said that if a husband and wife are always satisfied with one another, then the goddess of fortune automatically comes. In other words, where there is no disagreement between husband and wife, all material opulence is present, and good children are born. Generally, according to Vedic civilization, the wife is trained to be satisfied in all conditions, and the husband, according to Vedic instruction, is required to please the wife with sufficient food, ornaments and clothing. Then, if they are satisfied with their mutual dealings, good children are born. In this way the entire world can become peaceful, but unfortunately in this Age of Kali there are no ideal husbands and wives; therefore unwanted children are produced, and there is no peace and prosperity in the present-day world.

These six kinds of living entities are known as *manus, devas, manu-putras, aṁśāvatāras, sureśvaras* and *ṛṣis.* Yajña, being the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became the leader of the demigods, Indra.

### Verse text

*atreḥ patny anasūyā trīñ  
jajñe suyaśasaḥ sutān  
dattaṁ durvāsasaṁ somam  
ātmeśa-brahma-sambhavān*

### Synonyms

*atreḥ* — of Atri Muni; *patnī* — wife; *anasūyā* — named Anasūyā; *trīn* — three; *jajñe* — bore; *su*-*yaśasaḥ* — very famous; *sutān* — sons; *dattam* — Dattātreya; *durvāsasam* — Durvāsā; *somam* — Soma (the moon-god); *ātma* — the Supersoul; *īśa* — Lord Śiva; *brahma* — Lord Brahmā; *sambhavān* — incarnations of.

### Translation

**Anasūyā, the wife of Atri Muni, gave birth to three very famous sons — Soma, Dattātreya and Durvāsā — who were partial representations of Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. Soma was a partial representation of Lord Brahmā, Dattātreya was a partial representation of Lord Viṣṇu, and Durvāsā was a partial representation of Lord Śiva.**

### Purport

In this verse we find the words *ātma-īśa-brahma-sambhavān.* *Ātma* means the Supersoul, or Viṣṇu, *īśa* means Lord Śiva, and *brahma* means the four-headed Lord Brahmā. The three sons born of Anasūyā — Dattātreya, Durvāsā and Soma — were born as partial representations of these three demigods. *Ātma* is not in the category of the demigods or living entities because He is Viṣṇu; therefore He is described as *vibhinnāṁśa-bhūtānām.* The Supersoul, Viṣṇu, is the seed-giving father of all living entities, including Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Another meaning of the word *ātma* may be accepted in this way: the principle who is the Supersoul in every *ātmā —* or, one may say, the soul of everyone *—* became manifested as Dattātreya, because the word *aṁśa,* “part and parcel,” is used here.

In *Bhagavad-gītā* the individual souls are also described as parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Supersoul, so why not accept that Dattātreya was one of those parts? Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are also described here as parts, so why not accept all of them as ordinary individual souls? The answer is that the manifestations of Viṣṇu and those of the ordinary living entities are certainly all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and no one is equal to Him, but among the parts and parcels there are different categories. In the *Varāha Purāṇa* it is nicely explained that some of the parts are *svāṁśa* and some are *vibhinnāṁśa.* *Vibhinnāṁśa* parts are called *jīvas,* and *svāṁśa* parts are in the Viṣṇu category. In the *jīva* category, the *vibhinnāṁśa* parts and parcels, there are also gradations. That is explained in the *Viṣṇu Purāṇa,* where it is clearly stated that the individual parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord are subject to being covered by the external energy, called illusion, or *māyā.* Such individual parts and parcels, who can travel to any part of the Lord’s creation, are called *sarva-gata* and are suffering the pangs of material existence. They are proportionately freed from the coverings of ignorance under material existence according to different levels of work and under different influences of the modes of material nature. For example, the sufferings of *jīvas* situated in the mode of goodness are less than those of *jīvas* situated in the mode of ignorance. Pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is the birthright of all living entities because every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The consciousness of the Lord is also in the part and parcel, and according to the proportion to which that consciousness is cleared of material dirt, the living entities are differently situated. In the *Vedānta-sūtra,* the living entities of different gradations are compared to candles or lamps with different candlepower. For example, some electric bulbs have the power of one thousand candles, some have the power of five hundred candles, some the power of one hundred candles, some fifty candles, etc., but all electric bulbs have light. Light is present in every bulb, but the gradations of light are different. Similarly, there are gradations of Brahman. The Viṣṇu *svāṁśa* expansions of the Supreme Lord in different Viṣṇu forms are like lamps, Lord Śiva is also like a lamp, and the supreme candlepower, or the one-hundred-percent light, is Kṛṣṇa. The *viṣṇu-tattva* has ninety-four percent, the *śiva-tattva* has eighty-four percent, Lord Brahmā has seventy-eight percent, and the living entities are also like Brahmā, but in the conditioned state their power is still more dim. There are gradations of Brahman, and no one can deny this fact. Therefore the words *ātmeśa-brahma-sambhavān* indicate that Dattātreya was directly part and parcel of Viṣṇu, whereas Durvāsā and Soma were parts and parcels of Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā.

**After hearing this, Vidura inquired from Maitreya: My dear master, how is it that the three deities Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, who are the creator, maintainer and destroyer of the whole creation, became the offspring of the wife of Atri Muni?**

### Purport

The inquisitiveness of Vidura was quite fitting, for he understood that when the Supersoul, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva all appeared through the person of Anasūyā, the wife of Atri Muni, there must have been some great purpose. Otherwise why should they have appeared in such a way?

### Translation

**He was thinking: May the Lord of the universe, of whom I have taken shelter, kindly be pleased to offer me a son exactly like Him.**

### Purport

It appears that the great sage Atri Muni had no specific idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, he must have been conversant with the Vedic information that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead who is the creator of the universe, from whom everything emanated, who maintains this created manifestation, and in whom the entire manifestation is conserved after dissolution. *Yato vā imāni bhūtāni* (*Taittirīya Upaniṣad* 3.1.1). The Vedic *mantras* give us information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so Atri Muni concentrated his mind upon that Supreme Personality of Godhead, even without knowing His name, just to beg from Him a child exactly on His level. This kind of devotional service, in which knowledge of God’s name is lacking, is also described in *Bhagavad-gītā* where the Lord says that four kinds of men with backgrounds of pious activities come to Him asking for what they need. Atri Muni wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he is not supposed to have been a pure devotee, because he had a desire to be fulfilled, and that desire was material. Although he wanted a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this desire was material because he did not want the Personality of Godhead Himself, but only a child exactly like Him. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees.

### Translation

**While Atri Muni was engaged in these severe austerities, a blazing fire came out of his head by virtue of his breathing exercise, and that fire was seen by the three principal deities of the three worlds.**

### Purport

According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the fire of *prāṇāyāma* is mental satisfaction. That fire was perceived by the Supersoul, Viṣṇu, and thereby Lord Brahmā and Śiva also perceived it. Atri Muni, by his breathing exercise, concentrated on the Supersoul, or the Lord of the universe. As confirmed in *Bhagavad-gītā,* the Lord of the universe is Vāsudeva (*vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti*), and, by the direction of Vāsudeva, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva work. Therefore, on the direction of Vāsudeva, both Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva perceived the severe penance adopted by Atri Muni, and thus they were pleased to come down, as stated in the next verse.

### Purport

It is advised in the Vedic literatures that one should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Lord of the universe and the master of creation, maintenance and dissolution. He is known as the Supersoul, and when one worships the Supersoul, all other deities, such as Brahmā and Śiva, appear with Lord Viṣṇu because they are directed by the Supersoul.

**Thereafter he began to offer prayers to the three deities, who were seated on different carriers — a bull, a swan and Garuḍa — and who held in their hands a drum, kuśa grass and a discus. The sage offered them his respects by falling down like a stick.**

### Purport

*Daṇḍa* means “a long rod,” and *vat* means “like.” Before a superior, one has to fall down on the ground just like a stick, and this sort of offering of respect is called *daṇḍavat.* Atri Ṛṣi offered his respect to the three deities in that way. They were identified by their different carriers and different symbolic representations. In that connection it is stated here that Lord Viṣṇu was sitting on Garuḍa, a big aquiline bird, and was carrying in His hand a disc, Brahmā was sitting on a swan and had in his hand *kuśa* grass, and Lord Śiva was sitting on a bull and carrying in his hand a small drum called a *ḍamaru.* Atri Ṛṣi recognized them by their symbolic representations and different carriers, and thus he offered them prayers and respects.

### Purport

Since the deities were smiling, he could understand that they were pleased with him. Their glaring bodily effulgence was intolerable to his eyes, so he closed them for the time being.

### Translation

**But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe. The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva, you have divided yourself into three bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.**

### Purport

Atri Ṛṣi called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, *jagad-īśvara,* the Lord of the universe. The Lord must exist before the creation; otherwise how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building, this indicates that he must have existed before the building was constructed. Therefore the Supreme Lord, the creator of the universe, must be transcendental to the material modes of nature. But it is known that Viṣṇu takes charge of the mode of goodness, Brahmā takes charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Śiva takes charge of the mode of ignorance. Therefore Atri Muni said, “That *jagad-īśvara,* the Lord of the universe, must be one of you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom I have called. You are all so kind. Please let me know who is actually *jagad-īśvara,* the Lord of the universe.” In fact, Atri Ṛṣi was doubtful about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu, but he was quite certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures created by *māyā.* His very inquiry about whom he had called indicates that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord. Therefore he prayed to all three, “Kindly let me know who is the transcendental Lord of the universe.” He was certain, of course, that not all of them could be the Lord but that the Lord of the universe was one of the three.

**The three deities told Atri Muni: Dear brāhmaṇa, you are perfect in your determination, and therefore as you have decided, so it will happen; it will not happen otherwise. We are all the same person upon whom you were meditating, and therefore we have all come to you.**

### Purport

Atri Muni unspecifically thought of the Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, although he had no clear idea of the Lord of the universe nor of His specific form. Mahā-Viṣṇu, from whose breathing millions of universes emanate and into whom they are again withdrawn, may be accepted as the Lord of the universe. Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, from whose abdomen sprouted the lotus flower which is the birthplace of Brahmā, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Similarly, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is the Supersoul of all living entities, may also be considered the Lord of the universe. Then, under the order of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the Viṣṇu form within this universe, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva may also be accepted as the Lords of the universe.

Viṣṇu is the Lord of the universe because He is its maintainer. Similarly, Brahmā creates the different planetary systems and the population, so he also may be considered the Lord of the universe. Or Lord Śiva, who is ultimately the destroyer of the universe, also may be considered its Lord. Therefore, since Atri Muni did not specifically mention whom he wanted, all three — Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva — came before him. They said, “Since you were thinking of having a son exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the universe, your determination will be fulfilled.” In other words, one’s determination is fulfilled according to the strength of one’s devotion. As stated in *Bhagavad-gītā* (9.25): *yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ.* If one is attached to a particular demigod, one is promoted to the abode of that demigod; if one is attached to the Pitās, or forefathers, one is promoted to their planet; and similarly if one is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, one is promoted to the abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Atri Muni had no clear conception of the Lord of the universe; therefore the three presiding deities who are actually the lords of the universe in the three departments of the modes of nature all came before him. Now, according to the strength of his determination for a son, his desire would be fulfilled by the grace of the Lord.

### Purport

The universal form of the Lord is the cosmic manifestation, which is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and also the air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we see airplanes running from one place to another. Thus the entire cosmic manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in Him. Now the Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within the creation of His energy, which is simultaneously one with and different from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifests Himself in such varieties. There are some philosophers, called nondualists, who because of their impersonal conception think that varieties are false. In this verse it is specifically stated, *yo māyayā viracitam.* This indicates that the varieties are a manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus because the energy is nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties are also factual. The material varieties may be temporary, but they are not false. They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties. Here the word *praticakṣaṇāya,* “there are varieties,” announces the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi and who is the origin of all varieties of material nature.

**Let that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is understood by truly authorized Vedic literature and who has created peace and prosperity to destroy all calamities of the created world, be kind enough to bestow His glance upon the demigods. His merciful glance can supersede the beauty of the spotless lotus flower which is the home of the goddess of fortune.**

### Purport

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of the cosmic manifestation, is covered by the wonderful activities of material nature, just as outer space or the illumination of the sun and moon is sometimes covered by clouds or dust. It is very difficult to find the origin of the cosmic manifestation; therefore material scientists conclude that nature is the ultimate cause of all manifestations. But from *śāstra,* or authentic literature like *Bhagavad-gītā* and other Vedic scriptures, we understand that behind this wonderful cosmic manifestation is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in order to maintain the regular procedures of the cosmic manifestation and to be visible to the eyes of persons who are in the mode of goodness, the Lord appears. He is the cause of the creation and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. The demigods therefore prayed for His merciful glance upon them in order to be blessed.

Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Nara is a part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa. Thus the energy and the energetic together are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maitreya informed Vidura that Nara, the portion of Nārāyaṇa, had appeared in the family of the Kurus and that Nārāyaṇa, the plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa, had come as Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, with the purpose of delivering suffering humanity from the pangs of material burdens. In other words, Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi was now present in the world in the forms of Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna.

**The reason is that Satī’s father, Dakṣa, used to rebuke Lord Śiva in spite of Śiva’s faultlessness. Consequently, before attaining a mature age, Satī gave up her body by dint of yogic mystic power.**

### Purport

Lord Śiva, being the head of all mystic *yogīs,* never even constructed a home for his residence. Satī was the daughter of a great king, Dakṣa, and because his youngest daughter, Satī, selected as her husband Lord Śiva, King Dakṣa was not very much satisfied with her. Therefore whenever she met her father, he unnecessarily criticized her husband, although Lord Śiva was faultless. Because of this, before attaining a mature age Satī gave up the body given by her father, Dakṣa, and therefore she could not produce a child.
