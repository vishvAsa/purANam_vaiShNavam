GADYA TRAYAM</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://archive.org/details/shrI-vaiShNava-kAvyAni">TW</a></p>
<h2 id="śaraṇāgati-gadyam">Śaraṇāgati Gadyam</h2>
<p>The Saranagati Gadyam is the first of three compositions o Śri Rāmānuja in Sanskrit prose. The three prose pieces (gadyas) an expressions of the inner experiences of the great Acarya and are t be ranked with the mystic poetry of our alvars. The Saraṇāga Gadyam is actually a conversation between Śri rämānuja, Ś Ranganatha and His consort, and is a live exposition of the doctrin of prapatti (samvada ēṣa śaraṇāgati mantrasāra).</p>
<p>On a Panguni uttiram day in srirangam while Lo Ś Ranganatha sat in court with His consort on His Divine throne, S Rāmānuja stood before them, surrendered himself and his all to th Divine and begged that all his earthly sins be pardoned and that I be accepted in the service of the Divine couple, and got so accept with additional assurance that all his spiritual proteges would accorded what was assured to him.</p>
<p>Thus the assurance of acceptance was not in isolation Rāmānuja alone but to all his spiritual progeny. It is on behalf of humanity that rāmānuja pleaded and we as his spiritual heirs c feel assured of the Lord&rsquo;s grace. The Saranagati Gadya is a force commentary of the mantraratna, the dvayam. The shorter Sriran Gadyam is an abridged version of the Saraṇagati gadyam and directly addressed to his personal god-mamanatha! śriranganath The vaikuntha Gadyam expresses the yearning of the master reach śri Vaikuntha, the supreme abode of Visnu and serve Lord and His Consort. It recalls in spirit the last decades of Tiruvaymoli of Nammāļvār. The language of the Gadyas is sw A recitation of these is bound to please the Lord as much as it s</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Gady atrayam</p>
<p>and satisfies the reciter. The Lord is bound to grant our prayer, however sinful we may be, remembering the assurance He gave to the great Master.</p>
<p>The three Gadyas have been commented upon by several of bur acaryās. Some of these commentaries are lost to us. The ones That are accessible to us are, the manipravala commentary of Pariyāvāccan Pillai, the brief Sanskrit commentary of sudarśana bhattar and the gadya bhasya of Vedanta Dēsika.</p>
<p>The Saranagati gadyam or periya gadyam (big gadyam as is usually called) is presented here following mainly the commentary of periyavaccan Pillai. Here is the introduction in periyavaccan Pillai&rsquo;s commentary:</p>
<p>The kudrṣtis (misinterpreters of the vēdās) have it that only a knowledge of the meaning of sentences like tatvamasi (That you Fare) is the means to salvation (mōkṣa). Some of them have it that a combination of karmayoga and jñānayōga is the means. In order to vanquish these, Śri Rāmānuja established firmly in his Śribhāṣya that bhakti which has karma as an adjunct and which consists mainly in loving meditation of the Lord is the surest means to aSalvation. upasana, dhyana, and vedanta are alternate terms femployed to convey the purport of this jñāna (knowledge). The sastras declare that jñāna is the means for mōkṣa and śribhāṣyakāra establishes that knowledge in the form of bhakti (which is the heart of upasana) is the surest path to mōkṣa. (There are places in the Sribhasya and Gitäbhasya where prapatti or surrender is suggested thas a means but not quite explicitly). Lest those desciples of his who thhad implicit faith in what he declared as the means think that this (bhakti being the sure means) was his ultimate view and decide that tibhaktiyoga was the sole means to mōkṣa, he reveals the view dear</p>
<p>ee</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>to his acāryās, the one in which he had utmost faith as the sole means to salvation here in the gadyas. This view is that prapatt (nyasa) is the surest and unfailing independent means to salvation It is but a refined form of jñāna (knowledge). The question arises a to why Śribhāṣyakära did not vanquish the kudrstis by establishing that prapatti is the means established in the śrutis (vēdas). Feeling that, just as it would be inappropriate for a brāhmaṇa to initiate canḍāla into the vēdas, it would be equally so to reveal the tru spirit of śrutis to those (kudrṣṭis) who stand far removed from it, h vanquishes them using the language quite familiar to them ie., th śāstrās and reveals his cherished conclusion and true purport, closely guarded secret, (ētatvē mahōpaniṣadam dēvānā guhyam-Taittiriya Upanisad) to the faithful through the Gadyas.</p>
<p>What is the greatness of prapatti (as a means) relative to th great means (bhakti) explicity mentioned in the vēdānta? Bhak cannot be practised universally. Only those castes qualified to lea the vēdās could practise this vedik path; the path is difficult (lik crossing a pit of fire on a bridge of hair!); it does not yield the fru (salvation) quickly because of the possibility of many lapses; requires continuous self-effort and hence is inconsistent with th nature of the atman (as fully subservient to the Lord). Prapatti is t very opposite in that it is universal, easy, quick in yielding resu with no possibility of lapses, consistent with the nature of t atman, is a completed task (siddha) in that it does not need a self-effort, and is an appropriate means to the end.</p>
<p>The next question is; &ldquo;Is this means a conclusion contain in the vēdānta or not?&rdquo; The answer is an emphatic yes. T Taittariya upaniṣad declares the various means in increasing ord of effectiveness- satyam, tapas, dama, śama, dānam, dharn prajānana, āgnayāh, agnihōtra, yajña, mānasa, nyāsa and fina</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>declares tasmān nyasamēṣam tapasaāmatiriktamāhuḥ`- this (nyāsa) is the most effective and superior tapas of all these. The twelve mentioned earlier are in that order, the practice of truth, tapas-reducing bodily needs, dama-control of outer senses, sama - 2 control of inner senses, giving liberally of ones possessions; practice of duties, begetting children (to propagate dharma), tending the sacred fires, making offerings to the devas through the fire, sacrifices, meditation of God, and surrender. Further, since it is e said that the practice of elders who properly understood dharma (śāstra) is the superior authority as also the vēdās, this (prapatti) has the greatness of being dear and most acceptable to our preceptors (ācāryās). What has been accepted by the elders is proper authority to the faithful; to those who need more, it has the sanction of the śrutis too. It may be pointed out that the Svētāśvatārā contains the actual practice of prapatti - yō bramhāṇam vidadhāti pūrvam - tam ha devam mumukṣurvai śaraṇāmaham prapadyē.</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>Thus, because this means is decidedly in keeping with the spirit of the śruti, more consistent with the nature of the atman, dear i to our ācāryās, and most acceptable to the Lord Himself, it should be considered to be worthy of practice more (superior to) than bhakti. Feeling that this fact should not be lost to those who had It utmost trust in him (śri Ramanuja), he, out of his abundant mercy, he chose to publicise what actually transpired (in private) between my himself and the great Lord.</p>
<p>This is how this (composition) came into being: On a e particular auspicious festival (Panguni Uttaram day) while Lord he Ranganatha came out with His consorts (for the festival), and sat in e Court, Empērumānār (Śri Rāmānuja) came and worshipped at the na feet of the Lord. On this occasion (due to our good fortune) fear of Il samsara (cycle of birth, ignorance etc.) crossed his mind and he fe॥</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Saranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>at the holy feet and conveyed his total surrender seeking the Lord&rsquo;s protection. Here a question arises: Did he not seek this refuge when he first sought aśrayāna (initiation) at the feet of his Acarya Mahāpūrṇa (Periya Nambi)? Has not the Lord expressed that this &lsquo;seeking&rsquo; is to be made only once? sakrdēvaprapannāya&hellip;- Śri Rāmā&rsquo;s pronouncement in the Rāmāyaṇa. (yudhakanda-18.33-34). Seeking refuge or surrender is to be only once. It should not be repeated formally doubting the efficacy of the Lord. Here the mou repetition of surrender is done only out of eagerness to enjoy the bliss quicker (prāpyatvara). It being so, should not one remain passive till the owner seeks to do what he pleases with his property, in view of authorities (texts) like &ldquo;I do not need redress of my grief from any but You&rdquo; (Tiruvaimōli 5.8-3)&quot;; &ldquo;Remove my grievances or not-I have no other protector (5.8-8)&rdquo;; &ldquo;It will befit Him if He comes and delivers me from here&rdquo; (Sitas words from her prison in Lanka-Sundarakānḍam 39-30). Why should he repeat the `seeking refuge&rsquo;? This is the answer: he cannot remain passive because of his anxiety and eagerness in realising the goal and so surrenders his all and seeks the fruit. This is the state of our alvars too. The same is the case of our ācāryas who follow the (alvärs&rsquo;) footsteps. As fear of samsara as well as the desire to realise the goal keep on increasing, all that they (alvars) can do is to seek the protective refuge of the Lord nine times (many times) in the same way as they did once. Thus he seeks the protective refuge of the great Lord&rsquo;s feet for relief from samsara and acceptance in His service.</p>

<p>The Day and night, I prostrate the venerable rāmānuja, the crest jewel of the noble and the casket containing the camphor called vēdās.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>The text of the Saraṇagati Gadyam begins with a prayer to śridevi (Periyapirṭṭai). In this prayer, Sri Rāmānuja seeks Sridevi as his refuge and requests her to bless that his sincere saranagati at the feet of the Supreme Lord may be deemed to be in proper setting and bear the desired fruit. The idea is that she should intercede on his behalf and see that her beloved husband (the Lord) accepts his supplication and grants the desired fruit of being accepted in His service.</p>

<p>prapadye [1]</p>
<p>The Saraṇagati Gadya is a practical commentary on the dvaya mantra in which the eternal association of Śri (Sridevi) with the Lord is emphasised. She is ever present with the Lord to intercede on behalf of supplicants who approach Him. By Himself, He may either accept the supplicant because of His innate mercy or reject him because of His sense of justice which calls for punishment for sins committed. Śri, the Mother, sees to it that the latter mood is drowned and that His mercy comes into full play. It is natural for a child to approach the mother for any wish to be fulfilled without any uncertainty. It may be recalled that in the rāmānujanurrandādi, the final verse prays to Sri Ranganayaki to bless the secker with Sri Rāmānujā&rsquo;s holy feet.</p>
<p>Translation: Oh! Śridevi! Mother of all the world and more particularly my mother! The crowned and divine queen of the supreme Lord of all the Devas! Pure and faultless, ever inseparably</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Śaraṇāgati Gadyam</p>
<p>united with Him, full of all auspicious qualities, with a charming form, with the most wonderful and infinite collection of adorable qualities such as greatness, rulership and high virtues worthy and matching those of Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa, and to His utmost liking; having no other resort to look to, I seek thee as my refuge (since) you are the sole resort of the helpless.</p>
<p>The translation of the text is not literal. The text is actually in the form &ldquo;I take refuge in the unversal mother, Śridēvi&rdquo; but has been rendered in the form of an address to Śri since the next sentence conveys Sridevi&rsquo;s direct reply.</p>
<p>The word Bhagavan indicates the fullness of the principal qualities-knowledge (jñānā), power (śakti), strength (bala), lordship (aiśvarya- being isvara or commander), valour (virya) and brilliance (tejas)-and absence of anything lowly. Nārāyaṇa means the indwelling supporter of all (creations) and the possessor of all. She is dear (abhimata) to Him and to His utmost liking and befits Him (anurupa) in all respects-in form (vigraha) and, in qualities (guna). The need for mentioning Nārāyaṇa here is that Śri and Nārāyaṇa form an ideal and inseperable couple. (viśnōh ēśā anapayini). He is identified as Śriyahpati (Lord of śri) and she as Visnupatni. They are fitting partners in all respects. Recall the sentence `raghavōrhati vaidehi tam cēyam asitēkṣaṇam&quot;- Sita deserves (befits) Rāma in all respects and He also (deserves) this dark-eyed damsel. svarupa refers to characteristics and rupa to beauty of form. Both befit each other in every respect. The term guna is used twice-rūpaguṇa and kalyāṇaguṇa. The former indicates beauty of form and limbs and the latter indicates desirable natural qualities like love, affection, accessibility and the like.</p>
<p>The various characteristics (qualities) which contribute to the greatness of Śri are enumerated. vibhava denotes possession of that</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>enjoyable wealth. All that is His is hers also by virtue of her being His beloved wife. aiśvarya is lordship or sovereignty. The entire world is Hers. Even the Sarvēśvara&rsquo; allows Himself to be commanded by her when the need to make Him the saviour instead of the dispenser of mere justice arises. sila is ability to mix freely; easy accessibility, motherly love and affection-all are indicated. Such desirable qualities are infinite and cannot be enumerated. All her good qualities are always in full play.</p>
<p>padmavanālayām - resident in a cluster of lotuses; her constant presence is in her Consort&rsquo;s heart. The lotus is mentioned only as a thing of beauty and so very desirable and auspicious. bhagavati indicates fitness for worship and respect. śriyam-the word Śri has many connotations. Chief among these are śriyate - one who is sought (prayed to) by all beings as mediator for acceptance by the Lord and śrayate-one who seeks the Lord for saving the beings who approach the Divine couple. Others are: she patiently hears supplications; she makes them heard by Him; she negativates the faults of her children; she pleases: all by her desirable qualities. dēvim implies the divinity associated with her; He is the supreme Lord, she is the first Lady.</p>
<p>nityānapāyinim denotes she is ever present with her Lord without a moment&rsquo;s separation; always available for mediating between the sinning children and the discipline - loving Lord. niravadyam brings out her faultless nature; she is never proud of her exalted position and always adds to the greatness of her Lord. devadeva divyamahisi She is the crowned queen of the Emperor-King of kings. She is the queen of all queens (wives of divine being like Brahma and Rudra) and can carry out her wishes without any impediment whatever. akhilajaganmātaram-She is the universal mother;particularly my mother (asman mataram- mother</p>

<p>to even a lowly thing such as me); that she is the refuge of the refugeless-one could be certain of being saved by her-is indicated by aśaraṇyāśaranyam. That the supplicant has no other place to go is pointed out by ananyaśaśaranah. I seek refuge in the divine</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>The next sentence conveys the prayer to Śri who is sought after for the specific purpose of her mediation on his behalf.</p>

<p>Translation-2: I pray thee that you may be pleased to bless that my sincere and true saraṇagati at the lotus feet of Bhagavan be accepted as truely and well-performed and lead to the desired end without any interruption. The object (end desired) of my supplication (saraṇagati) is the very personification of (born out of) my eagerness and loving desire to be of service in all its forms to Him under all circumstances (in public court and in the privacy of inner apartments). The desire to be of service is (in turn) a result of the immense joy of divine experience (bhagavadanubhava),an experience which is the ultimate in desirability beyond which there is nothing to be desired; an end in itself, eternal, uninterrupted, full and clear (without any trace of doubt or confusion). The divine experience (in turn) results from a well-founded devotion-(in its stages of) parabhakti-desire for a vision of</p>
<p>of the Lord;</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>parajñāna-direct perception and paramabhakti-cagerness for continuous experience not suffering even an instant&rsquo;s interruption-solely directed at the lotus feet of the lord, a devotion highly desirable in itself (This is a free translation attempting to bring the spirit of the text rather than at literal accuracy).</p>
<p>Translation-3: Śri&rsquo;s reply; So it shall be; by it (saraṇagati) all your wishes shall be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The prayer made above indicates that the supplication made to Śri is to seek her mediation (puruśākāra) so that success in his supplication to the Lord would be ensured. Śri Rāmānujā conveys his yearning to serve the Lord without interupption under all circumstances. His intense selfless devotion led to a wonderful experience of the divine which created the yearning to be of service in the same way as the serpent (Tiruvantāļvān) which served as the umbrella when He walked, was His seat (simhāsanā) when He sat, was His footwear when He stood and His bed when He reclined on</p>
<p>the ocean.</p>
<p>Here the words aśēsā sēṣātaika ratirūpa are significant- desire in the performance of all kinds of service without any exception (or restriction). The primary object is that the Lord shall be pleased, whoever may perform the service. The pleasure should be His. Pleasure may be derived by witnessing His pleasure. This itself is a form of service. The servant should not feel elated about his being of service. He should feel that the master has been properly served and pleased. ālāvandār, in his Stotraratna uses the word prahāṛṣayisyāmi, implying that the service is solely to make Him happy-not for one&rsquo;s own pleasure (Stotraratna-45)</p>
<p>Śri&rsquo;s reply that all your wishes shall be fulfulled&quot; is interpreted by Sudarśana sūri to mean that the fruit of his</p>
<p>27Śaraṇāgati Gadyam</p>
<p>supplication will not stop with him (Śri Rāmānuja) but will continue to be available to all his spiritual heirs. This includes outselves too because of out link to Śri Rāmānuja by a chain (parampara) of ācāryās.</p>
<p>After the formal expression of surrender at the feet of the Mother in the first curṇikā (sentence), Sri Ramanuja conveys his prayer to Śri in the second, beginning with `paramarthika&rsquo;. The prayer is that he should be accepted as a prapanna and a kainkaryapara (servant). His saraṇāgati prayer to the Lord is to get accepted for eternal and devoted service. Though devotion and yearning for service are already there in him, he feels that these should be prayed for and obtained so that they will be continuous and everlasting.</p>
<p>pāramārthika-`artha&rsquo; means wished for result-prayojana. Parama means supreme. When this word paramarthika qualifies the word bhakti as an adjective, it implies that the bhakti is natural and not artificial (assumed). When it is taken as qualifying caraṇāravinda (the lotus feet), it becomes the highest prayojana (sought-after-fruit). Bhagavan in bhagavatcaraṇāravinda indicates the fullness of auspicious and desirable qualities which stir up devotion. caraṇāravinda indicates the highly desirable nature of the Lord&rsquo;s form-vigraha, aikāntika-having one end; not having any other purpose; atyanatika-eternal; without end. Parabhakti, parajñāna and paramabhakti are stages in the fruition of bhakti indicated earlier. paripurna-complete and whole; not in separate parts like svarūpa (nature), rūpa (form), guna (qualities), vibhava (greatness), aisvarya (enjoyable wealth) and so on. This word paripūrṇā qualifies bhagavadanubhava-comprehension and experience of the Lord. Such experience should be anavarata- uninterrupred; continuous and nitya-eternal; visadatama is clear</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>Gady atrayam</p>
<p>comprehension (vision) of the Supreme leading to the paramabhakti state. Intense devotion is an end in itself (ananyaprayojana) and not a means to some other end. Bhagavada nubhava is the highest blissful experience of the Lord in His abode (paramapada). From these expressions, we get an idea of the ectsacy of the bhakta in the experience of the Lord-contemplating His beautiful form with intense devotion along with His highly desirable attributes and qualities. This anubhava leads to ever-increasing love which in turn leads to the yearning to be of service to the beloved. Anubhavajanita pritikaritakainkarya implies the yearning to be of service born out of intense love, a result of the ectstacy of the experience.</p>
<p>Then follow epithets qualifying the service prayed for. asēṣāvasthōcita- befitting all states; in court as well as in the inner apartments, aseṣasēṣataikaratirupa-personification of desire to be of all forms of service - waving the fan, holding the umbrella, offering beteleaves and sandal paste, sounding the trumpet and so on. We now come to the operative part of the prayer. My surrender at the Lord&rsquo;s feet bhagavat caraṇāravinda saraṇāgati - here bhagavān implies the fullness of knowledge, power and ability which make Him the sole means to fulfil the desired wish without any assistance whatever; pāramarthaki here means true and in proper form; yathavasthita- as it should be. This implies rejection of all other means except total Surrender to the Lord. Avirata astu me-let it be uninterrupted ill the desired end is achieved (until prayer is granted).</p>
<p>This curnika clearly indicates that the formal surrender to śriḥ in the first curṇika is only to seek her recommendation (puruṣākāra). The Acarya prays, &ldquo;Oh Mother! I fall at your feet that my śaraṇagati to the Lord should be in true and proper shape</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Śaranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>and result in the fruit sought for. The desired fruit is onl uninterupted and faultless service in all forms. The eagerness an longing to be of such service is itself a desired goal. This eagernes for service surely results from an experience of the Lord&rsquo;s vision a well as comprehension born out of intense devotion. This devotio should itself result from His grace.</p>
<p>Following Śridevi&rsquo;s assurance (curnika-3) that all his wish will be fulfilled, Rāmānuja proceeds to address the Lord direct and seek Him as the means to the desired end of eternal and lovin service in diverse forms. Since the Gadyam is a practical expositio of the dvaya mantra, the prayer to Śri may be taken as t equivalent of śrimat, the opening words of the dvaya mantra itself.</p>
<p>This is followed by a very long cumika in which we find poetic rendering of all greatness contained in the word Nārāya with his attributes, the divine jewels which adorn His person, H weapons, His consorts and attendants, His divine abode, His spo field and all. This curnika ends with the formal offer surrender-saraṇamaham prapadye. For convenience we will sp this into several parts.</p>

<p>In these, Śri Rāmānuja addresses the Lord bringing out H pre-eminence in several ways. This forms a stōtra. There is pra but no flattery because His pre-eminence is such that He has equal or superior and no praise can do full justice to t pre-eminence.</p>

This is the significance of jñāna aikasvarupa, similarly in ananda-bliss. Bliss is all that is favourable (anukula) and enjoyable (sukharupa). Thus far the nature of the Supreme Self; the next part of the curṇika describes the Divine form.</p>
<p>(ii) Śri Rāmānuja proceeds to describe the divyamangala hi vigraha. Your divine form is most agreeable to you and worthy of you (suits you); unchanging, beyond the reach of thought</p>

<p>VIITE</p>
<p>(vi) This passage is a fitting description of the great Ladies who enjoy all the splendour of the divine form - vigraha of the Lord without lettino</p>
<p>it to waste like the full moon in a forest. Though the splendid qualities touched upon here have already been dwelt upon earlier in the first cürnika (bhagavannārāyaṇa), it need not be taken as a monotonous repetition; primarily it is a narration of the devotee&rsquo;s inner experience and any repetition would only disclose the ardour of the devotee. Further, it can be taken that Sri Rāmānuja praises Śri first as his Mother and refuge (as the mediatrix to plead for him) and now as the beloved consort of his Master. It should be noted that the clause ends with śrivallabha ! (beloved Lord of Śri). The entire clause only qualifies Śri, She is so endearing and desirable that the Lord is drawn to her as a very hungry person would be to good food. This bond of love would promote her role both as the mediatrix and as the recipient, alongwith the Lord, of the loving service rendered by the devotee.</p>
<p>ory person</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>Translation: You are the beloved Consort of Sridevi of Sridevi (Mahalakṣmi) the multitude of whose unlimited, unsurpassed and countless auspicious qualities such as sovereignty, glory and graciousness are eternally faultless and befitting You. You are also the consort and Lord of bhudēvi and Niladevi ossessing similar charm and form.</p>
<p>The epithets used here have already been explained earlier. It may be noted in passing that the term vallabha (beloved) is used with reference to Śri and Nayaka (Lord) in referring to Bhū and Nila, though He is equally the Lord of all His consorts. This indicates that bhu and Nila assist in enriching His experience of Śri.</p>

<p>(vii) Translation:- This clause describes the Lord innumerable and diverse parijanas attendants who serve th Divine Couple. &lsquo;You are served by an army of followers an servants, men and women, waiting at Your divine feet to minister Your needs and comforts, whose nature, existence and action conform to Your will and pleasure ananta (sēṣa), Garud Viśvaksēna and others (along with their wives), whose sole delig is in complete subservience (total service) as their essenti characteristic features; eterna।</p>
<p>and faultless, all endowed with host of beneficient and desirable qualities such as unsurpasse knowledge (devotion), activity and unlimited ability (to act in You service).</p>
<p>Notes: This passage talks about the parijanas who conside their association with the Lord&rsquo;s consorts as a supreme blessing an help enrich the Lord&rsquo;s pleasurable experience with His consorts. A these attendants are ever-free (nityasūri) souls. svacchandānuvṛ indicates that their actions are in accord with the wishes of th Lord. Being nityas, they could intuitively foresee the Lord&rsquo;s wishe Lakṣmaṇa&rsquo;s service was pleasing to rāma because he foresaw ever need. (bhāvajñēna). This is in contrast to bound souls whose action are directed by the Lord&rsquo;s will. aśēṣasēṣataika ratirupa - when th Lord partakes of their service, each is engaged in a particul service; but their ardour in it is such that it shows their eagerness engage in all forms of service. Then the instruments of service: they are eternal and not confined to any period; faultless in that th service is not for their own satisfaction but solely for the pleasu of the Lord. &ldquo;When am I going to gladden the Lord (prahaṛṣayiṣyami) I look forward to His pleasure.&rdquo; (stōtraratna-46 niratiśayajñāna is limitless knowledge knowledge of how to be devoted service; kriya- action consistent with the knowledg</p>

The leading personalities are then named. Seṣa - the service - incarnate serpent. He is an umbrella shading the Lord; the footwear protecting His feet; throne when He sits; and the couch when He reclines; Sesasana - this means Viśvaksēna - the commander-in- chief; he is so named because he is the first to partake of the leavings of the food consumed by the Lord. Garuda - the big bird</p>
<p>eavings of the food consumed vehicle (Tiruvadi); pramukha-these are the chief among the retinue; nānāvidha - diverse; gate keepers, watchmen, water bearers, fan wavers, etc.etc. doing a variety of services; anantaparijana countless servants; paricārikā - fair faced female attendants who bear flowers, like Vimala and so on; the wives of the chief attendants, like Sūtravati (wife of Visvaksēna)</p>

<p>(viii) Then follows a description of the Land of bliss (paramapada-vaikunntha) the abode of the Lord. &ldquo;You are the Lord of vaikunntha the eternal, faultless, immeasurable land, which abounds in many kinds, each variegated, of innumerable objects as well as the means and places of enjoyment, all appropriate to You, infinitely wonderful, of limitless transcendent glory, faultless and immutable, beyond the comprehension of even the great yogis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The nature of the services indulged in by the nityas of paramapada were described; now is described the Land which promotes such loving service; paramayōgi etc.,- of immeasurable greatness; incomprehensible even to supreme yogins like Sanaka. One can just say &lsquo;primarily of the five upaniṣads (upaniṣads here does not mean vēdānta but divine elemental components of which</p>

</ul>
<p>from flaws, great beyond all measure; vaikunthanatha-Lord of vaikuntha described in terms referred to. The bhōktās (persons who enjoy all this wealth) are not specifically mentioned because all these are for the enjoyment and pleasure of the Divine Couple. Every sentient being feels, &ldquo;I am the focd&rdquo; (ahamannam)- object of enjoyment. The Śrutis refer to them as annadaḥ (eaters of the food), because their very existence, to be of service and enjoyment (to the Lord), is a supreme goal. Their enjoyment is to witness the pleasure of the Lord.</p>
<p>inuod</p>
<p>How</p>
<p>(ix) You have as your sport the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the entire worlds filled with diverse, wonderful and countless objects of enjoyment, the instruments of enjoyment, and suitable places for pleasurable experiences, in the form of prakṛt (matter), puruşa (jīvās). and kāla (time) which are by nature ever under service to You following Your wishes; their nature, existence and activities are ever under Your control.</p>
<p>This passage describes the sport-field (lilavibhūti) subject to construction and destruction, of the divine Lord of Vaikuntha</p>
<p>42prakrti</p>
<p>svasankalpanuvidayi-the nature, existence and activity of the worlds (the lilavibhuti or the field of sport) always follows His will;</p>

<li>matter, which is associated with the three qualities satva,</li>
</ul>
<p>With the te rajas and tamas and is subject to change in form and size-characterised by jadatva (not self revealing), being of use to the jivas for good and bad experiences leading to salvation and bondage; purușa- The jivas characerised by being associated with matter (soul and body) being sustained by it (food), activity in the form of good and bad deeds and experiencing the result thereof; kala-time, characteised as being non-sentient, controlling the changes undergone by prakṛti, and promoting such change. All these are subservient (svasēṣatēka svarūpa) to the Lord. The worlds are filled with diverse objects of enjoyment as described in the text.</p>
<p>Śri Rāmānuja then addresses the Lord using epithets which bring out all His outstanding qualities-His high eminence, His easy accessibility, mercy, affection towards devotees and being the sole refuge of the helpless. He finally conveys his prayer of seeking rufuge under His lotus feet.</p>

<p>Translation (x):- Now</p>
<p>(x):- Now to the addresse</p>
<p>addressed epithets: satyakāma-One possessed of ever fulfilled wishes. satyasankalpaḥ -One able to accomplish all that He wills. parabramhabhuta -well known (recognised) rasp parabramha (the Supreme).</p>
<p>purusottama-best of Beings; Mahāvibhūtē of limitless wealth; sriman-Lord of Sri the auspicious. Nārāyaṇa- renowned as nārāyaṇa (Possessor and supportor of all, the cit and acit). Śri vaikunnthanatha-lord of Vaikuntha (the eternal abode).</p>
<p>These as well as those that follow have, in one way or other, been given expression to already. This address shows the deep ardour of the supplicant who is not tired of praising the Lord. In fact no praise is full enough to do justice to His supremacy and most desirable qualities. These should therefore not be construed as mere repitition-punarukti. These epithets justify the surrender in that it is made to the Lord who is possessed of all the necessary qualities and attributes. He is the Origin-Cause of the entire universe (ādikāraṇam) and its Supreme Lord. Hence He is the best upaya and He is most fitted to grant the prayer and be the end or goal (upēya) to be attained.</p>
<p>Notes on (x):- satyakāma :- One who has all His wishes fulfilled. He is possessed of all the materials needed for bringing of</p>

</ul>
<p>eings in association with chosen bodies; satyasankalpa - One who as the competence to carry out fully what He wills.</p>
<p>Je trills from he subtle st</p>
<p>of association with cit and acit - &ldquo;Let me becomes hany&rdquo; and immediately become all the gross that is seen; arabrahmabhūta - One who is the parabrahmā</p>
<ul>
<li>(the Supreme eing). He is the entire Universe and is infinite. purusottama - The est of persons. One can distinguish thus:</li>
</ul>
<p>thus: puruṣaḥ, tpuruşa, uttarapuruşa and purusottama. purușa - person different rom insentient matter - bound souls in samsara; utpuruşa - souls eleased from bondage (the muktas); uttarapuruṣa- the eternally free ityas who were never in bondage; uttamapuruşa - the supreme uler of all souls, different from the nityas. muktas were once ssociated with sin-low and evil-heya (infirmity); the nityas were ever associated with heya. The Lord can remove all that is letestable in others; residing as the inner soul of all three kinds of ivas - bound, released and ever free, he is not touched by any of he trace of heya in them and can completely remove such heya in he aśritas - the bound who approach Him as means for liberation. Thus the epithet purusottama differentiates Him from all other ouls, as one who transcends (permeates), supports and possessesm ll. He is truly Great. Another interpretation - one who fulfills the lesire of even the big like the four-headed Brahma (puru-many; anōti-gives) mahāvibhūtē-Ruler of innumerable possessions. He is not only the possessor of all wealth - the worlds subject to creation ind destruction (lilāvibhūti) as well as the eternal world of bliss nityavibhūti),but is also capable of awarding these to those whom He pleases; śriman - Lord of Śri with whom He is ever associated. He awards the puruṣārtha of service, but, the recipients of service is he Divine Couple; nārāyaṇa particularly named nārāyaṇa. The nfinite qualities implied in this name are well known. śriman ṇārāyaṇa implies that the Divine Couple form the supreme goal to</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>45146</p>
<p>Saranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>be attained; vaikunthanatha - Lord of the nityavibhūti. vaikuntha the most suitable place for uninterrupted service by the released a ever free. Of these eight epithets, the first four indicate that He creator and the second four, His being the most desirable goal to attained (prāpya). He is the kāraṇa - origin and creator, and t präpya - the final goal. He is also the prapaka - the means to atta the End the End</p>
<p>(xi) Then follow epithets which emphasise His upayatva giving expression to qualities which proclaim His aśrayaniyat (affording protection): apara shows the boundlessness of the qualities. apārakāruṇya - infinite mercy - His inability to bear t suffering of others without sorrow. It reaches out to bring ev enemies like Rāvana into His protective fold; sausilya - mixing one of the beings with whom He mixes. &ldquo;I feel I am primarily man, the son of dasaratha&rdquo;, declared Srirama to Brahma and to t Devas. Kṛṣṇa declared to the cowherds, &ldquo;I am one of yo relatives; I am no divine&rdquo; vatsalya - affectionate &ldquo;even to enemie - so said Sita about Rāma to rāvana. If one asks &ldquo;Why then d rāma kill Rāvaṇa&rdquo;, the answer is, &ldquo;Rāvaṇa did not allow Rāma save him. Even killing is an act of love. Does not the mother p out a stick from her child&rsquo;s hand if it tends to harm its own ey with that stick? audarya - He gives his devotees what they need if He is himself the beneficiary. Having done everything He fe that He has not done enough. Having protected the modesty Draupadi in the open court Kṛṣṇā felt to the last that He had n done His duty in full. &ldquo;I feel like a big debtor&rdquo; - this was H feeling. aiśvarya - wealth enough to give all (persons) whatev they ask for; it grows with giving away. Even when one hinders H saving grace, He does not fail to protect even that person &ldquo;Y make me agree to stay under your protection (though I tried</p>

<p>move away)&rdquo; declares ṇammāļvār. saundarya- beauty of limbs; it steals the looks and mind of the viewer to itself; puts desire in men to take on role of womanhood and declare; &lsquo;I am conquered; victory to Thee. mahōdadhe vast ocean, Beginning with apara boundless, this epithat ends with mahōdadhe each of the qualities enumerated is a boundless ocean in magnitude.</p>
<p>Having described the desirable qualities which make us seek His protection, Rāmānuja goes to show the effective result of these qualities. analöcitaviseṣa aseṣalōkasaranya - saranya-the refuge; analōcitaviseṣa- without any consideration of birth, conduct, knowledge (beyond distinction by birth etc.,); aśēṣalōka - of all worlds - all their residents. He is the universal refuge. praṇatarthihara-He who removes the ills of all who come to Him. It may be pointed out this is one of the particular names of Śri Varadaraja of Kanci. aśritavatsalyaika jaladhe - the quality of affection which is the basis of His being pranatarthihara - boundless motherly affection which treats the undesirable as desirable. Rāmānuja is not tired of repeating this quality, which is His incomparable Glory (nikaril pukal)</p>
<p>(xii) anavarata viditanikhilabhūta jātayatatmya - One who knows all the time the true nature of all beings. This indicates His omniscience (infinite knowledge). He knows all our shortcomings and our helplessness. aśeśacaracarabhutaniyamana niratā - One who commands at all times all that is mobile and immobile. There is nothing which is not subservient to Him. Even inaction is in accordance with His will. It is the indication here that the Lord does not brook hindrance to the flow of His grace. aśēṣa cidacidvastuseṣibhūtā - Lord and possessor of all that is sentient and non-sentcient. The question by the supplicant is implied &ldquo;should you not attend to my need as your duty ?&rdquo; It is the duty of</p>
<p>47Saranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>the master to protect his possessions. nikhilajagadādhārā sustainer of all the worlds. Should you forget my existence? akhilajagatsvami - the master of the entire universe. Should you not remove our sins and make us go to you and stay forever under your protective wing? asmatsvāmin - more particularly my master! My coming to you is due only to your grace-satyakāma - earlier this epithet was used as a desirable quality; the second time it signified His sway over cit and acit (time) as instruments of His sport,; now it signifies His fullness; His not being in need of anything from the devotee but the devotion. We have no right (virtue) to claim; He should lift us by His fullness. satyasankalpa - first this epithet was employed to indicate His ability to create all the desirable things in abundant measure; next the will which aid His sport with these worlds; now, this word is used to indicate His ability to bring about even impossibles by sheer will. Are you not capable if You will so, to lift even this worthless (me) effortlessly to the level of the eternally free who reside in Your blissful abode ? sakalētaravilakṣaṇa- refreshingly different from all others (other than He) in nature like qualities, form and so on. Are not all these superior aspects for the benefits of Your devotees? Are they not for the benefit of the entire worlds? Surely they are not just for Your own enjoyment. Your protection (to us) will be complete only if You make available all these auspicious aspects for our benefit and enjoyment.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>(xiii) These aspects are enlarged in the following epithets. arthikalpaka - kalpaka is a divine tree which fulfills all the wishes of the seeker. He gives all to those who seek; even Himself apatsakha - friend in distress; the saviour of the elephant Gajendra, Draupadi and others in their dire need, Śriman - ever associated with Śri who induces your protective grace. närāyaṇa-You have</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>een taking care of all (of us) even without the intercession of Sri ecause of natural irrevocable relationship. asaranyasaranya - the efuge of the refuge-less.</p>
<p>I am outside the fold of even You (with all the qualities numerated) because of my evil nature; but whom do I have to rotect me but You ? ananyaśaranah aham tvatpādāravinda ugalamsaranamahamprapadye - with no other refuge to go to I eek Your loveable lotus feet as my sole refuge for succour. tradvayam</p>
<ul>
<li>the dvaya mantra is to be recited here inaudible to thers. All the foregoing is a commentary on the dvaya mantra in to wo parts I seek the lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa ever associated with ri (to intercede on my behalf) as my sole refuge; I seek to be accepted in the service of Nārāyaṇa with Sri (the Divine Couple.)</li>

<li>These two couplets are from the puraṇās. The ide conveyed earlier are repeated in the words of rṣis who deserve respect. It pleases the Lord to hear the words of devotees who ha realised Him. These verses need not be taken as a repetition of t saraṇagati (taking refuge) conveyed earlier. The purpose here renunciation of things which bind one to this world and taking ho of the Lord.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tranalsation: Renouncing father, mother, wife, childre relatives, friends, teachers, gems, wealth, grain, lands, houses (a the like), renouncing completely all dharmas (actions etc., practic aiming at some goal) and all desires, I take refuge in Your holy fe which measured the entire worlds.</p>
<p>Notes: The first three lines list items which have to renounced and the last, that which is to be held. Among the items be renounced-first comes the list of the living, then materi possessions, and finally the abstract. All the persons mentioned the first line are very desirable as far as worldly life is concerne Father and mother are to be respected and obeyed. Both are dear b virtue of bodily relationship as well as by their interest in o well-being. But all this relates only to life in this world. In th ultimate analysis the Lord is our Father, Mother, teacher and a When we hold on to Him as our sole means of salvation, all oth ties should be snapped. These (the living and the material) may st be desirable as aspects (vibhuti) of the Lord. They may be desirab if they promote god-realisation.</p>
<p>The Vedic injunctions &lsquo;Treat your father as God&rsquo; (pitr dev bhava) and the like are enjoined for leading an ordered worldly lif It may be good in its own way but it only leads to further bondag since both worldly virtues (like doing one&rsquo;s duty by parents, wif children) and sins (by neglecting prescribed duties) bege</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>leasurable or painful results in this world. They are only mpediments to god-realisation. Similarly children; a son (putra) aves one from the hell known as &lsquo;put because it is one&rsquo;s enjoined worldly duty to beget sons (and daughters). They are desirable for bvious reasons. Relatives uphold the family tradition and are desirable as evidence of pedigree. Friends are dear and desirable since they help in worldly need. By teachers is meant those who impart worldly knowledge which helps to earn a livelihood. The acarya who leads one to the Lord is never to be renounced. The Lord values the relationship with the acarya immensely.</p>
<p>The material possessions - wealth, jewels, food, land (for growing food), houses (for shelter) are all desirable because they can be used for one&rsquo;s pleasure. But these can also serve the good purpose of providing for the Lord&rsquo;s worship and hospitality to His devotees and thus be desirable. Anything worldly even if it helps only the performance of worldly duties (sāmānya dharma) is fit to be renounced as binding to samsāra (bondage).</p>
<p>Having completely</p>
<p>renounced (santyajya) whatever ties one to this world, as well as paths leading to the Lord like karma, jñāna etc., all desires of this world or of other worlds (like svarga and the land of Brahma).as also the desire to enjoy the pure self (kaivalya) (sarvadharman sarvakāmān sākṣaran) that which is to be sought is described - saraṇamtē āvrajam vibhō !; te avrajam - I seek You - You, my rightful master. vibhō indicates the fullness of knowledge, power, mercy and all benign qualities of the Protector. lõkavikrāntacaranam-caranam - feet; this indicates that the Lord is not abstract but has a body; the feet which by measuring the entire worlds reached out and touched all His creations and blessed them even without their seeking Him; such is His love and concern for His creations.</p>

<p>to me.</p>
<p>Notes: - Unlike the father who takes care of the off- sprin only after it is born, the mother cares right from conception. Th idea conveyed here is that the Lord protected the entire world (before creation) by keeping them in subtle state within his bod just like the mother. It should not however be forgotten that th father sows the seed. By saying &ldquo;You are the mother and father&rdquo; the Acarya means both these aspects of creations. tvamēva bandhu</p>

<p>one can be termed as relative only if one keeps us away from straying out into the wrong path. You are present within as th antaryāmi and keep us in the right track. gurustvamēva - guru is on who dispels the darkness that is ignorance; You destroy the life i this world susceptible to ignorance and grant life in the everbrigh paramapada. You are the first (foremost) preceptor. This recalls the invocation &ldquo;lakṣminatha samarambhām vandēguruparan parām`` tvamēva vidyā - You are the imparted knowledge. The Lord is the subject matter of all knowledge and all knowledge is controlled by Him. So He is the Knowledge. draviņam tvamēva- You are my sole wealth. Wealth is the instrument of enjoyment (happiness). The Lord affords pleasure and happiness by being the subject of loving meditation. tvamēva sarvam - You are my all; listed as well as unlisted. mamadevadeva - you substitute for all that I have renounced; you are my sole hold -the Lord of the residents of the Land of Bliss.</p>

<li>You are all this (father etc.,) not only to me but to all creations living, moving and stationary. This verse and the next are verses 43 and 44 of Chapter XI of Bhagavadgita - words of praise uttered by Arjuna after witnessing the cosmic form of kṛṣṇabhagavan.</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation 7. You are the Father of this world (all the worlds) of moving and non-moving beings (and objects). You are the Guru and (therefore) most worthy of honour. There is none to equal You. Whence can there be another to surpass You in all these (three) worlds? Oh! Being of unsurpassed glory!</p>

<li>The supplicant begs to be pardoned for past offences. The pardon is necessary in the view of the supplicant. No doubt the Lord is ready to offer His loving protection even to enemies (ripunamapi vatsalah). He asked Sugriva to go and fetch Vibhiṣaṇa when the latter sought His protection and was ready to accept even Rāvana. He may not take cognizance of past offences on the part of the supplicant who did not approach Him over ages. To a-once-chaste wife who went astray and then came back to the husband and claimed conjugal rights, coming back to the husband and claiming his protection are serious offences in themselves. She has absolutely no claim to do so or for acceptance. The case of the supplicant is similar. Having gone astray previously in falling at improper feet and being engaged in improper service, one falls at the feet of the Lord having no other go. This is like the crow (son of Indra who seriously offended Sita in the Rāmāyaṇa) who tried to escape from Rāmā&rsquo;s arrow but, at last, out of sheer helplessness, had to fall at His feet. Like previous offences, approaching the Lord is (in the mind of the supplicant it causes fear because he has no reasonable claim) itself an offence.</li>

<p>Translation: 8. Therefore, bowing down, prostrating the entire body before You, I entreat Your pardon, Oh noble Lord! It is</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>Saraṇagati Gadyam</p>
<p>proper Oh Lord! that You show kindness and affection to me wh am dear to You like a son to his father and a friend to his friend.</p>
<p>Notes: You are to me all relatives put in one (father mothe etc) and so You should pardon all my lapses. praṇamya- menta salutation; praṇidhāyakāyam bodily prostration; vocal i understood; seeking refuge is to be by thought, speech and action prasādayē- I seek your pardon. iśamidyam - the Lord, the prais worthy; aham-sinner and offender as I am; aham following isamidyam suggests that the supplicant acted as he pleased unmindful of the Lord and did not praise but hated the praiseworthy Lord. The claim for protection (forgiveness) is then put forth; you should forgive me as a father would forgive his erring son (pitēva putram) and you should bear with me as a friend would with his friend (sakhēva sakhyam); you should forgive my faults as a dear (lover) does in the case of his beloved. (priyaḥ priyayaḥ); daiva-My Lord! You are my all and it is proper that you pardon me (sodhum arhasi).</p>

<li>Earlier (in this Gadya), the Acarya sought the refuge of the holy feet of Śri (Piratti) so that he may acquire confidence in the chosen path (prapatti to the Lord) and a real taste for the goal (präpyaruci). Getting this prayer granted by the grace of Piratți, he proceeded to delineate the aspects of the Lord which make him approach the Lord, namely His lordship of the lower worlds and the highest Land of Bliss, and the auspicious qualities which help the supplicant such as sila (naturally mixing with the lowly) and</li>
</ol>
<p>54</p>
<p>o saulabhya (accessibility). He then sought refuge in the Lord&rsquo;s feet with the recommendation (puruṣākāra) of śri. He then quoted verses from the puranas and itihāsas (Gita in mahābhārata) conveying the same idea. He then renounced worldly relatives and possessions and sought the Lord as his All. With the thought &ldquo;this is not for me alone but for all cetanas&rdquo;, he begged the Lord&rsquo;s pardon for conveying the saranagati. Thus far is the practical application of the first half of the dvaya mantra.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Now we get a commentary on the second (later) half of the dvaya mantra. Since the desired fruit cannot be obtained till the undesirables (obstacles to the goal) are removed, the Acarya renders the meaning of the word namah. He needs the removal of all obstacles starting with dehātmābhimāna (mistaken identity of - the body and the soul) and ending with the idea of `mine&rsquo; in service to the Lord. This would become possible only if the results of all past actions (karma) are done away with. In his prayer (Tiruviruttam), Sathakōpa (Nammālavār) mentioned nescience (avidya-ignorance) as the first obstacle. Rāmānuja mentions actions because lack of true knowledge (ajñāna - ignorance) leads to actions leading to bondage. Śathagōpa mentioned avidya first because the &lsquo;I&rsquo; arising from dehātmābhimāna (identifying the soul with the body) threatens to ruin him. This is really a result of lack of true knowledge. Śrirāmānuja however, has th obligation to the darśana (system of philosophy). The māyāvādin has it that salvation is the destruction of avidyā (ignorance); but the real obstacle to release is karma and so the Acarya mentions this first. Nammāļvār started with the causes while Rāmānuja mentions the effects leading to samsara (bondage). They all ma</p>

<p>akṛatyakarana - prohibited by sastrās - like causing misery to animals; stealing; telling lies; extolling the unworthy by the speech intended to extoll the Lord; eating things which should not be eaten and so on. kratyaakaraṇa- not doing duties enjoined according to station in life- varṇāśramadharma-due to laziness, disbelief, indifference etc. bhagavadapacāra thinking of the Lord (Nārāyaṇa) equally with other gods like Siva; considering His avatars as mere ordinary being etc; trying to examine the material of which the arca deity is made; trying to appropriate wealth to be used in His worship-selling it away to others; bhāgavadapacāra- insulting śri vaisnavas due to self-centred haughtiness, enmity towards His devotees caused by desire of wealth etc., making fun of the handicapped; asahyāpacāra - not being able to bear the sight of the well-being of the Lord and His devotees (like Hiranyakasipu); sins against one&rsquo;s acarya belong to this class- that is, not acting in keeping with what was taught by him, teaching what was learnt from him to the undeserving for small gains, not being friendly with co-disciples (class mates) due to jealousy and similar reasons. All offences against the Lord&rsquo;s devotees are asahya (unpardonable). In the view of the Lord, offences against His devotees are unpardonable; devotees would consider offences against Him as unpardonable. Explaining why He did not accept the hospitality of Duryodhana, kraṣṇa said, &ldquo;You hate the Pandavās. They are my very soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ravana&rsquo;s behaviour to Sita (caused by kāma) is bhagavadapacāra. Hiranya&rsquo;s behaviour towards Prahlada is asahyapacara; so also śiśupala&rsquo;s behaviour to Kṛṣṇa. Note that the word ananta-countless and immeasurable is used twice-first in relation with ordinary offences- akṛtyakaraṇa and such and later with bhagavadapācāra and the like.</p>

<li>Earlier, the Acarya begged pardon for actions transgressing the sastras. Here he begs pardon for his perversities. Actions referred to earlier (clause 9) relate to not performing prescribed duties and indulging in prohibited activities. Here pardon is requested for acts resulting from ignorance and perverse understanding.</li>
</ol>
<p>Translation 10-Please pardon my ignorance and perverse understanding of the nature of the soul (jivātma) and the entire universe, over a period of time without a beginning. Pray pardon me for all perverse actions arising out of misconception about everything in the past, present and future.</p>
<p>Notes 10-anadikālapravṛttam- it did not happen suddenly one day; it is spread over infinite time the beginning of which cannot be traced; it looks as if it is associated with the very nature of the atman (though it is really not and is surely acquired) because of the length of time. It is inferred to be acquired because it is washed off one day by the grace of the Lord. Perversity in knowlegde-viparitajñāna- conceiving one thing as another; like a rope as a snake; a piece of shell as silver. My misconception relates to the atman and the universe. About the atman-identifying the atman with the body; thinking atman to be self-willed</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>(svatantra-not dependent on the Lord); taking the atman to be subservient to others (than the Lord). In the case of the universe; Conceiving beings as man, animal, reptile, tree, plant ;and son on, unlike enlightened souls like Prahlada who saw Hari Govinda in everything or every created thing as His form. It is this misconception which leads to perversity in action. In the case of the atman, involving oneself in the welfare of the self (instead of leaving it to the Lord); in the case of the world, if one does a harm, to try to avenge it instead of taking it as the result of one&rsquo;s past karma. adyapi vartamānam-present actions based on misconceptions (past is taken as mentioned); vartiṣyamāṇamca-also those yet to come; sarvamkṣamasva-being ignorant of all these, You the omniscient should recognise all and pardon me.</p>

<li>The ācārya repented his deeds and the ignorance which led to such deeds. Now he begs for the termination of the relationship with the body. Earlier he begged &ldquo;please forgive me&rdquo;; now he begs &ldquo;please take me across (taraya)- help me to shed this mundane body&rdquo;. Our karma and ignorance are but unpleasant memories in Him and will get dissolved when He forgives. The body cannot be destroyed as the matter (prakṛti) which it is composed is eternal. Only the relationship-the apparently eternal union with it-has to be snapped; hence the request for snapping the ties. All he needs is to be lifted up. He does not want to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s property (prakṛti of which the body is made of). He prays only for complete separation from it. The true nature of the soul should shine forth. This would be possible only if the link with the body is done away. The true nature is in fact completely hidden by the body. Milk and water cannot be seen separate from each other when mixed. Only certain appliances (like the traditional bird</li>
</ol>
<p>59</p>
<p>Saranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>hamsa) can separate the milk from the water; so also the all-powerful Lord alone can separate the atman completely from the body; otherwise it is in a state of ruin. mamamāyāduratyayā-this prakṛti which is Mine cannot be crossed; māmēvayē prapadyantē māyāmētamtarantite- only those who seek me as their sole refuge will be able to get across this. (Gita 7-14): Since He declares that He alone has to be sought to get one away from it (prakṛtisabandham), the Acarya begs Him for the same. The cūrṇikā is concerned mainly with describing all the effects of prakṛti (body).</p>
<p>Notes: anādikarmapravāna pravṛttan- caused by deeds done over time without a beginning; maya-by me and not due to others; not a favour from the Lord; this has been acquired solely by me. What is the result? bhagavat svarupa tirōdānakarim- it spreads a veil over Him, my natural master-hiding the natural relationship. He is the consort and Lord of śri, the Supreme Purușa, the abode of all auspicious qualities, Lord of the eternally awakened souls (nityasūris), Lord (master) of the eternal world (paramapada) and the ever changing world of sport (lilavibhūti). But the kudṛsti-the māyāvādin (the misinterpreter of the sruti-the exponent of a false world) has it that there is only the Brahman which is pure consciousness devoid of any quality or attribute and all else is false (non-existent). The bhedabhedavādin has&rsquo; it that cit, and acit and iśvara all together constitute a single whole bu</p>
<p>denies that isvara is the posessor of the other two. The sankyas have it that the jiva is the doer of deeds and these yield results enjoyed by the doer; what then is the need for an iśvara? They deny the existence of isvara. These distortions are the outcome of the hiding (casting a veil over) the Lord by his māyā-the prakṛti. The link with the body causes all this.</p>
<p>gav</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>viparitajñāna- prakṛti (body) does not only hide, but produces perverse conception; identifying with the atman what is patently not atman; the feeling that the body is the atman; prakṛti covers not only the nature of one&rsquo;s self but also that of the Supreme Self. Only the body appears to exist; there is only self-government (by the atman and not by God). svaviśaya ya śca bhōgyabuddhērjananim- the self-government is only an empire of thieves and scoundrels and results in the enjoyment of objects which yield pleasure to the body-smell, taste sound etc. as the summum bonum of life. dehendriyatvēna bhōgyatvēna sūkṣmarūpēṇa ca avasthitām-subject to the fourfold changes-by the base of enjoyment, the body; by the instruments of enjoyments, the organs; by the feelings like sound, smell and so on; and by the root of all these, the subtle prakṛti, daivim-aid to your (deva&rsquo;s) sport; gunamayim-full with the threefold qualities of satva, rajas and tamas; this admixture is the very basis of prakṛti of the bodies acquired by jivas.</p>
<p>māyām-capable of producing diverse effects and therefore called maya (illusion); wonderful because of the different changes it undergoes; presenting diverse objects of enjoyment, kaleidoscopic as it were; mamtaraya-I am caught up with prakṛti whose capabalities have been enumerated; please get me across from its grip. (Having descrribed the cruel effects of the body which is a manifestation of prakṛti, the supplicant prays for deliverance from the association).</p>
<p>From what follows, the Commer tator suggests: The Lord seems to ask- &ldquo;On what basis do you make this request? In what way do you deserve this? What is the merit you have acquired?&rdquo;. The supplicant replies &ldquo;Do I claim any merit? (no); though I have done bad deeds over long period of time, though I have been steeped in ignorance thinking that the body is the atman, though</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>Saranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>immersed in the pleasures of the senses; if the nature of the Selfi examined, it turns out to be solely Yours, totally unrelated t others; I am Your servant (dāsabhūtam). māmtaraya- means get m across; dāsabhūtam qualifies mām. The Lord seems to ask, &ldquo;all ar my dāsas, it is a common feature; what special merit can yo claim?&rdquo; The supplicant replies-saranagatosmi, tavāsmidāsa itivaktāram mām-I who submit; &ldquo;I am a saraṇāgata, I am Your Your servant.&rdquo; These</p>
<p>These two epithets (1) dāsabhūtam ( saraṇāgatōsmi&hellip;vaktāram qualify mam. I realise I am by natu Yours. I declare that I have sought You as my sole means deliverance and my sole goal. I declare that I am solely Yours ar not in the least of any others. taraya-pray believe what I submit an get me across from the ties with the body.</p>

<li>These three verses constitute verses 17, 18 and 19 chapter 7 of the Bhagavadgita. The Acarya cites these three vers and prays for the jñana (knowledge) which takes the form of bha (devotion). Earlier, the curnikas expatiated the meaning of the wo</li>
</ol>
<p>62Gady atrayam</p>
<p>namah. The meaning of namah is the removal of obstacles (virōdhi). This is not enough; he needs to be accepted in service (kainkarya) to the Lord; this is the highest bliss. Equally dear with kainkarya is intense devotion in its three stages of parabhakti, parājñāna and paramabhakti which follow into the Land of Bliss also. Wishing to attain this intense devotion the Acarya prays for sjñana that is bhakti (knowledge which is devotion; bhaktiścajñāna viseṣah) which is an end in itself and not aimed at any other fruit. This jñana is preliminary to the intense devotion mentioned earlier and is prayed for in terms of the gita verses (7-17, 18 and 19).</p>
<p>Translation: (Śrikṛṣṇa divides his devotees into four classes according to the fruit wished for. Two are after wealth; the third is after self-enjoyment or kaivalya, the fourth, the jñāni is after realisation of the Lord). Among them (four types of devotees) the wise man (jñāni) being always attached to Me, and also single-minded in his devotion, is the best. I am extremely dear to this jñāni and he too is dear to Me.</p>
<p>Wol All these (the four) are generous (or magnanimous) in that they worship Me alone for the desired end; but My own conviction is that the jñāni is My very soul. With dedication he is devoted exclusively to Me as his highest goal.</p>
<p>vely to me as is st</p>
<p>At the end of many births, the wise man (jñāni) resorts to Me, holding that vasudeva is (I am) his all (support, sustenance and pleasure); this high - souled (mahātmā - whose greatness is beyond understanding) is extremely rare to find (very hard to come by)</p>
<p>Lord! Please transform me into a jñāni who is described in the three verses (quoted).</p>
<p>THE EM</p>
<p>Comments (1) Among the wealth-seeker, self-seeker and the seeker of the Lord, the jñāni (seeker of the Lord) is superior.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>Šaranagati Gadyam</p>
<p>His superiority stems from his being nityayukta and aikabhakti nityayukta is one who, unlike a person who seeks Me (Kṛṣṇa) for some end and leaves Me when he has gained his end, seeks Me as his desired goal; aikabhakti is being devoted solely to Me as his cherished fruit unlike one who loves a fruit and loves Me for the sake of gaining that fruit (end or goal). priyōhi jñāninah atyarthamaham- I am extremely dear to the jñāni. His love towards Me is beyond words. saca mamapriyaḥ - he is also dear to Me. The Lord describes the jñani&rsquo;s love to Himself as immense and His love as less. Why does He say so ? Is His love towards the devotee really lesser than the devotee&rsquo;s towards Him? Each one&rsquo;s love is contained by his size. The devotee (jivan) is atomic while the Lord is all encompassing (pervasive). Rendering water in a small pit muddy (by stirring it up) is not the same as rendering the ocean muddy. Even so, His affection for the devotee is such that Kṛṣṇa feels, &lsquo;What is My affection in comparison to his ? The devotee&rsquo;s such that it produces fears in him (about the safety of his beloved Lord) which even the all powerful Lord cannot allay. This also may be the reason for His feeling that the devotee&rsquo;s love is greater.</p>

<p>(krsna are generous (noble, magnanimous). They afford opportunity to Me to give generously. Among those who seek fulfilment of desires from Me, the jñāni is different (superior). What is this difference? He is my very soul. He supports Me. The avadharaṇa (emphasis) aiva in ātmaiva means that the jñāni is His support (dharaka) not temporarily but at all times. It is but proper that temporarily but at all times. It is but proper that a cetana (jiva) who has realised knowledge of himself to deem isvara as his support sustenance and pleasure.

<p>64</p>
<p>one raises this doubt, the answer is clear (mē matam) - let anybody</p>
<p>anyway; hink anyway; this is My conviction. anuttamamgatim-he holds only Me as his highest goal, finding it impossible to support nimself without me. yuktātmā - united (with Me); asthitaḥ sahi - his thoughts are even in this manner (mentally united with Me always).</p>

<p>(3) bahunām janmanāmāntē - who ever has worshipped Me alone over many janmas (lives), and in the end with Me as the sole object of his knowledge, mam-me, vasudevassarvam-vāsudēva is all; He is my wealth, my beloved consort, children and so on; my mother, father, brother, resting place, refuge and my well-wisher; Kṛṣṇa is all (wealth, relatives etc., which have to be abandoned - i.e., abandoning these, kṛṣṇa is sought as all in their place). prapadyate - seeks; holds steadfastly. samahātmā-he is infinitely great. There is none to equal him; even I cannot equal him. sudurlabhaḥ - his equal cannot be found in this world or in other worlds, even in paramapada the supreme Land. Such a person whose mind is clear even in this land capable of confusing the most learned, cannot be found either here (this world) nor there (My world) because such a person is very rare. I can only wish for such a soul; the wish will not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>iti - in this manner - ślōkatrayōdita - as delineated in the three stanzas; jñāninam māmkurūṣva - make me one possessed with such knowledge (devotion). In the first verse He said, &ldquo;the jñāni is very dear to me&rdquo;, in the second, &ldquo;He is My support&rdquo;; Both these will have meaning only if such a person can be found. In the third verse,</p>
<p>no only if such a person can be foun He says &ldquo;it is near impossible to find such a one in the first instance&rdquo;.</p>

<li>In the second curnika addressed to Sridevi, the Acarya talked in detail about the nature of the service resulting from deep devotion - parabhakti etc., Is it not repetition to talk in the same vein here (in this curnika) also? The answer to this question is - it is not necessarily so. There, with the intention of seeking Sridevi&rsquo;s blessings to develop in himself a taste for the service, he referred to the nature of the service. Having taken refuge at the feet of the Lord with devotion (with the blessings of śri) the acarya actually begs the Lord to be accepted in service.</li>

<p>great pleasure and love (caused by hearing what the Acarya said) repeats these words and gladdens the heart of the Acarya saying, &ldquo;I am pleased to grant that all your wishes be fulfilled in the fullest measure. Here the Commentator narrates an incident: Hearing the text of this Gadya, Embar, an intimate disciple, asked, &lsquo;How are we to believe that the great Lord was pleased to tell you all this?&rdquo; Empērumānar (Ramanuja) replied, &ldquo;These are words which he made me utter after having shown his quality of miscibility (the high mixing with the low) like a fruit in the hand. So, nothing stands in the way of believing that these are His own words. The rest of the Saranagati Gadyam are the words expressed by the Lord - the assurance He gave.</p>
<p>Translation: 16- (All possible shortcomings on the part of the supplicant are listed and the assurance of the Lord is that the former&rsquo;s prayer is granted despite the shortcomings purely by His mercy). Eventhough you might not have followed the paths prescribed in the scriptures for attaining the desired fruit of service (to Me); eventhough your immense load of sins may obstruct your following the spiritual paths; eventhough you may have (done) actions which have displeased me very much; though you may have incurred the extreme displeasure of My devotees (by your acts); though you may have indulged in unpardonable sins; eventhough your essential nature (ätmasvärupa) may be veiled by a beginningless (age-old) perverse ahankära (feeling of I and mine) causing and resulting in these sins which keep growing; even though you may be steeped in age-old perverse impressions (gathered from previous births) which cause and result in the twin features - ahankara and apacara (displeasing acts); eventhough you may be tightly bound to matter (prakṛti - characterised by the threefold qualities of satva, rajas and tamas) which lead you to</p>

The dvayam should afford the resting place tvam - You who have uttered the sacred formula;</p>

<p>enough? No; His grace is needed. So He says, mataprasada labdha&rsquo;. You will have all the obstacles removed, and devotion generated by My grace. Not only this; there is-more-matprasādādēva-solely by my grace. The eva (solely), indicates that the flow of the grace is unaided by any other agency. Only the Lord is needed to grant it. sākṣātkṛta-comprehended, fully realised, yathāvasthita - realised as it is; is there a comprension otherwise? Yes; it is possible; it is written in the śruti-varuņi bhargava vidya (Bhrgu, son of Varuna, asks his father to teach him brahman; the father commands the son &ldquo;go and perform tapas meditate&rdquo;.

What is it that has been realised? mat svaruparupa guṇa vibhuti lilo pakaraṇavistaraḥ - My essential nature, My divine form, My auspicious qualities, My immense wealth, My world of sport and of bliss in all its extensiveness, aparōkṣasidhah - not by hearing of it or by thinking of it- by actually seeing; manniyāmyatā mat dāsyaikasvabhāva ātmasvarūpaḥ - seeing the essential nature of yourself (ātmasvarūpa) as solely subservient to Me (matdāsyaika), and subject solely to my command (manniyāmyādaika). If actual realisation comes, it is plain as day that the self is subsurvient to Him</p>
<p>ely His) and subice to is 11</p>
<p>madēkānubhavaḥ - If realisation dawns, it will not be without His becoming the subject matter of experience. If the nature of the self is clear (unclouded) it will certainly go to the realisation in exactness - the total subservience - atyantapäratanatryā - to His will to be used as He pleased. Unlike in kaivalya - ātmānubhava, you</p>
<p>used as he p (the self) will have only Me (super-self) as the subject of experience; the eva only differentiates the self (person) whose experiences are for his pleasure (not totally for the pleasure of the Lord). The experience of the Lord for one&rsquo;s own pleasure is no different from the experience of one&rsquo;s self. The experience of the Lord - service to Him is a pleasurable experience no doubt; but the self should not appropriate to itself any of the pleasure; the pleasure should be solely that of the Lord; the self may feel pleased that the Lord has been pleased and feel happy. What is conveyed by this is; in seeing (comprehending) the self, it is not enough if one sees He is my Lord; if one sees truly &lsquo;I am His&rsquo;, then only He becomes the subject of our experience. The authority in this regard is the vedic text ahamannam (I am the mod); but it is not only as food; the</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>Gady atrayam</p>
<p>consciousness of the self should</p>
<p>o serve its purpose; I am th eater of the food&rdquo; (ahamannadaḥ), says the śruti; the self (cetana) is pleased in the experience; the experience is not purposeful without this pleasure of witnessing the Lord&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>Vismat dasyaika priyah - the experience does not end in itself; the words of Sathagopa &ldquo;being close to Him for time without end&rdquo; (tiruvaimōli 3-3-1) is followed by &ldquo;we should render flawless service&rdquo;. The same Nammāļvār has defined the nature of the self by the words &ldquo;Having borne your superior lotus-like feet on my head, I will not even think of blissful salvation - mōkṣa,&rdquo; Service results from love born out of the experience. The emphasis is dasyaika (only in His service) shows that any independent pleasure for the self is stained by ahankara (I-ness) which is most undesirable. &ldquo;You have (addressing the devotee) service unto Me as your sole aim&rdquo;, paripurna mpanavarata nityaviśadatama ananyaprayōjana anavadhikātiśaya priyamadanubhavastvam, complete and total in itself, without even momentary interruption, eternal (continuous), as clear as a direct vision, without any other end (other than being of service), an experience which is far more elevating than even the enjoyment of the four-faced (in Satyaloka) Brahma - Your experience of Me (service unto Me) is such.</p>

Your eternal service is the result of devotion born of the divine experience&rdquo; When the Lord said all this, the Acarya wondered what the basis for all this blessing was; it struck him that the mere utterance of the dvayam resulted in all this blessing, and the `ēvambhūtōsi spelt out by the Lord.</p>

<p>Translation: Freed from all traces of obstacles and miseries resulting from association with the body in the form of adhyatmika adhibhautika and adhidaivika varieties, you shall live happily here in Srirangam, till your body does fall, repeating the dvayamantra</p>
<p>talle constantly in this manner along with its full purport.</p>
<p>and auda</p>
<p>Udols Comments - 18. The Lord said &ldquo;nitya kinkarōbhava&rdquo; implying that the service would sustain the devotee. The basis for this grant of bliss is the chanting of the dvayam. &ldquo;What a wonder ?&rdquo; feels the devotee. &ldquo;What is there to wonder about? there is nothing to lack (about dvayam)&rdquo; says the Lord. &ldquo;Can mere mention grant this immense fruit?&rdquo; the devotee repeats. &ldquo;You have seen the result, Should I assure you again? You have come to be accepted? Your wishes have been granted in full. You may engage yourself in service here with this body Land of Bliss</p>
<p>1st as in t paramapada``. śri Rāmānuja pleads; &ldquo;This body of mine is subjec to the threefold miseries !. I do not know how long it would last; am not sure about the best place to live; how then do you sugges</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>hat I do not lack anything ?&rdquo; The Lord answers; &ldquo;O! this is your doubt. I will detail how it will work out``.</p>
<p>adhyatmika abrādhibhautika</p>
<p>by adhidaivika</p>
<p>y duḥkhavighna</p>
<p>gandhara hitasvam - You shall get on without even a trace of obstacles arising out of the pain caused by the three-fold miseries. The devotee asks, &ldquo;how can that be with this mundane body?&rdquo; The Lord says,&rdquo; tvam-you. You are exceptional. What prevents you from living in the manner aforesaid?&rdquo; The idea is time is running out fast; the results of karma are wearing out; the goal is coming nearer; thinking thus, feeling the immensity of the fruit you are shortly to get, do not mind the troubles due to mundane existence. This is just like the fast immediately preceding the crowning (of a King) &ldquo;If that be so, what shall I do as long as I live with this body?`` The devotee asks again.</p>
<p>dvayam arthānusandhānēna saha - meditate on the meaning of the dvayam, as your constant companion- &ldquo;Distinct and far from the people of the land&rdquo; (Tiruvaimoli 10-6-2)- &ldquo;quite apart from the worldly people, distant from them in intense longing for My sevice, feeling I have reached Nārāyaṇa (10-6-2) and surrendering all to Me&rdquo;. To such a person the meditation on the meaning of dvayam will be the lasting friend. Earlier He said dvayavakta- chanting the text of dvayam; now he says dvayam arthānusandhānēna saha; the text is not enough to beget His grace; the meditation on its meaning is needed to pass time purposefully.</p>
<p>SH (NEVERING)</p>
<p>sadā ēvam vaktā: - ēvam - in this manner. Earlier, the master conveyed this surrender in three ways; first in his own words; second in the words of the earlier masters; third time in the words of the itihasas and purāņās - ēvam emphasises the manner in which the master conveyed his surrender first. Irrespective of the number of times and the different words, he can repeatedly surrender only</p>
<p>77Śaraṇagati Gadyam</p>
<p>unto the Lord; there is no other go. The surrender is only to ga His grace; that is gained through this (Ramanuja&rsquo;s own words in th Gadya) - ēvam vaktā - not mentally but in words which indicate th overflow of the mental experience; dvayam arthānusandhāher saha ēvam vaktā - pronouncing these words (as in this Gadya) yo have expounded the dvayam; Is it enough if it is but once Obviously not. sada- constantly. Why so? Because the mind is a</p>
<p>ap to think of other means and ends, constant meditation would sh them out. The self is associated with the body and also with th Lord. The association with the body may lead the self into object other than spiritual; the association with the Lord, into matters i keeping with the true nature of the self. In the present case, th devotee, fearing straying into other objects, has sought out th Lord; he has dissociated himself from the other pursuits; yet th goal of service in the Land of Bliss appears to be far away; the Lor says &ldquo;sada - constantly so that the devotee&rsquo;s time is well-spent i meditating constantly on the meaning of the dvayam.</p>
<p>poph To remove the doubt as to when this existence is to terminate, the Lord says yavaccarirapātam - till this body is cast off What is the idea behind this question - &ldquo;When?&rdquo; It is not due to any doubt of the fruition of other means to the End; not even the end o the experience of the fruits of action (karma) as in the case of the upāsaka (who follows a prescribed path like bhakti yōga) who keeps inviting death as a favoured guest, having completed their se task (upāsana). He has no association with other paths. Then, ha not the ālvārs s</p>
<p>I said &ldquo;He who grante</p>
<p>vaikunntha as soon as deat occurs&rdquo; (Tiruvay mōli 9-10). He asks &ldquo;when ?&rdquo; because he i itching for the fruit of realising the Lord; even a short while extend into a long wait; the chosen path does not brook delay in fruition hence the question &lsquo;when?&rsquo;. The devotee is eager; the chosen path</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>(surrender) is flawless, then the present existence is solely due to His will. So he persists in asking Him. The Lord replies - &ldquo;the delay is due to your body (your having to live with it); you need not wait for the total consumption of all karma (the results thereof); it is fast on the decrease; things are on the move and the goal is coming nearer.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The devotee pleads: &ldquo;existence in this world of ignorance is unbearable; you who have set a time limit, should also guide me as to where I should pass the time. The Lord commands: atraiva - here itself; śrirange in this Śrirangam; it is different from the world of samsara; it is different from the eternal World of Bliss; it is truly a third world in itself; you live happily in this third world of mine - Śrirangam. You are different from the samsarins of this world; you are yet to join the</p>
<p>nityas and muktas of the other world (vaikuntha). This is the best place for you to live in. To you who experience the Lord (Me) even with a hostile body, there is no equal. Similarly, all the worlds are not comparable to this place where I am prostrate neglecting My Land of Bliss. sukhamāsva - you are verily like a released soul; live happily here in srirangam.</p>
<p>This 18th clause is an utterance of the Lord in reply to śrirāmānuja&rsquo;s fear of life in this world which is apt to destroy or veil true knowledge and generate darkness (ignorance) and steep one in</p>
<p>samsăra.</p>
<p>To the prapanna (one who surrenders) there is a pre-prapatti and a post-prapatti state. The pre-prapatti features have been detailed elaborately so far. The post - prapatti state is now detailed. How should one behave at the time of shedding the body? When does one obtain the supreme goal? These questions are answered here. These are uttered by the Lord.</p>

<p>Comments 19:- Starting with evam bhütōsi (clause 17) the Lord recounted the nature of the reward obtained after the body (is hed) and how to pass the time till then during the life time. Now He recounts the good He does at the time of death (rejecting the ody) not even expecting antimasmṛti (thinking of the Lord at the ime of death.)</p>

The basis for this is - kevalam madiyaya evadayaya - it came about just now. It is not due to the earlier stages of karmayōga, jñānayōga and bhaktiyōga, each leading to the other and flowering into parabhakti. (bhakti itself is knowledge - jñāna) What happened now is solely due to My grace. Earlier, the Lord aid madiyaya evadayaya niśśēṣa vinaṣṭaḥ and now again madiyaya Evadayaya. This makes it clear that whether it is at the time He marks us to receive His grace or after we have become the recipients of the grace, or when He rids us of our enemy (sins), or when He confers benefits, in all the states, the emptiness on the part of the beneficiary is His sole asset. What is instrumental is only His grace. ati- highly; prabuddhaḥ - woken up. This shows the difference between the earlier and present states. māmēva ālōkayan this is the difference; in the earlier state (before receiving His grace daya) he was aware of himself and of the Lord; in the later tate, since his awareness is a result of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, it would ave the Lord as the sole subject. mam - denotes the Person of</p>

<p>The refinement of the mind-the proper attitude-is not something that anybody could attain. Should one lose the opportunity of salvation because of lack of refinement? How is no further refinement-so necessary for the other world (the Lord&rsquo;s The Land) to be acquired? The answer is simple: tadanimēva by immediately the body is cast off you will be blessed with ar parabhakti and further stages of devotion. The lack of refinement the earlier in terms of devotion does not matter. To the upāsaka nis (bhaktiyogin who treads the arduous path of bhakti as detailed in nay the sastras), even the slightest fault in his practice will pull him mi down the ladder of ascent.

<li>Text: Let there be no doubt in your mind regarding this.</li>

<p>Comments-The Lord feels that there is a lurking doubt in the devotee&rsquo;s mind and gives an unequivocal assurance. Looking at the immensity of the gift of God (ridding the devotee of an infinite load extremely minute of sins and the grant of eternal bliss) and t</p>
<p>presence</p>
<p>nature of what the cētana does to deseve this immense reward, one continues to doubt whether all this can be possible at all. The experience in this world is that to gain the fleeting fruits of worldly enjoyment, one has to put in mighty effort. Can it be possible that eternal and everlasting enjoyment in the of the Supreme can be gained so effortlessly? Yet the Lord says He has granted it This is the lurking doubt. The Lord assures &ldquo;Let there be no doub at all. You have abjured all conscious effort to earn virtue and have placed the entire burden on Me. I value this trust. Let there be no doubt about the truth of what I have said (the assurance I gave). did not say all that merely to console you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Comments:- anṛtam&hellip;. etc. What I have said is not a lie. I have never uttered a falsehood, To remove a possible doubt that as Kṛṣṇa, He stole butter, told all sorts of lies and that His words may not be true, the Lord assures: &ldquo;Rāma never speaks a second word&rdquo;. The idea is &ldquo;these words are not thosse of Kṛṣṇa; Rāma assured the sages of Dandakaranya that He would offer them full protection and said, &ldquo;Believe Me. My word is to be trusted fully, I do not speak with two tongues.&rdquo; sakṛtēva&hellip;etc.-&ldquo;Sage Valmiki has recorded my words spoken at the sea-side in his great epic.

<p>Thus ends Śaraṇagati Gadya. Before we proceed further with the other two pieces of the Gadyatrayam, we shall summarise the Saraṇagati Gadyam in its various sections. This will help remember the development of the composition with ease.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first section gives expression to his surrender at the feet of Śri after extolling her greatness and qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Section 2, the Acarya explains the purpose for which he seeks her intercression. He seeks her puruṣākāra and expreses that his surrender at the feet of the Lord should be made appropriate and successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grant by Sridevi of the prayer made to her is conveyed here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formal surrender is given expression to seeking the protection of the Lord. The Acarya extolls the Lord describing the greatness of the divyatma svarupa (essential nature) divyamangala vigraha (the divine and bewitchingly beautiful form), the divine qualities, the fine jewels adorning Him, His divine weapons, the unique association with His consorts, His immense wealth in the form of the nityavibhuti (The changless land of bliss-paramapada) and the lilavibhuti (the worlds of sport from this world up to satyalōka), His rulership of these, His having nothing to desire and</p>

<p>9.10. The Acarya entreats the pardon of the Lord for sins of the past, present and future.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>
<p>Since the Lord has ordained in the Gita that His maya (prakṛti - the attachment to it out of ignorance) cannot be overcome except by surrender to Him, he entreats the removal of the māya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Acarya entreats true knowledge as detailed in the Gita. It may be mentioned that this knowledge refers to seeking the Lord with single-minded devotion as both the means and the goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He entreats the conferment of true devotion by the Lord as mentioned in the Gita.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He entreats that he should become the personification of devotion in its stages parabhakti, parajñāna and paramabhakti.</p>

<li>
<p>He seeks that he should be blessed with the consequential experience of the Lord and the yearning for service unto Him.</p>

<p>I prostrate before my Acarya, the great sage Rāmānuja, who has a clear conception of the truth about the three entities, cit, acit and isvara.</p>
<p>This piece, known as Sri Rangagadyama, is but an abridged version of the Saraṇagati Gadyam. It is explicitly addressed to Śri Ranganatha and hence called Śri Rangagadyam. The first Gadyam is popularly known as the &rsquo;long gadyam&rsquo; and this one, the &lsquo;short ey gadyam&rsquo;. This piece is also a practical exposition of the</p>

<p>Introductory Comments: The purpose of Srirangagadyam is th this first the Acarya prays for the most desirable goal of being accepted in the service of the Lord. To gain this end, he states his g lack of deservedness in terms of any virtue on his part; he states his y shortcomings; then he seeks the Lord&rsquo;s feet (that is the Lord Himself) as his sole means; he begs that his prayer should be granted for its own sake; he reiterates his faith in the Lord; he prays that this faith should be the result of the all merciful Lord full of auspicious qualities; he prays that he (Ramanuja) who is not for the service of anybody else, should be blessed by the Lord with service in keeping with his own nature; all this he entreats to grant him.</p>

<p>Ot</p>
<p>To the seeker after salvation who has taken to this path of prapatti, it is essential that he should spend his time in devoted service to the Lord, worshipping and serving Him in his temples; in</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>Śriranga Gadyam</p>
<p>serving his devotees; if incapable of that, by meditating on (om giving expression to ) His names and qualities; if lacking in depth of devotion for this, in uttering the dvayamantra and (learning and thinking on) its import. Intending on the last of these options, the Acarya gives expression, briefly, to the ideas conveyed in the earlier Gadya. He conveys these in confidence to the Lord at Śrirangam. He intends this shorter composition as fit for repetition in the presence of the Lord by devotees intent on the fruit prayed for.</p>

The meaning of the name Nārāyaṇa includes lordship over the two lands (the vibhutis - the land of His sport and the Land of bliss), being the destroyer of all that is lowly and being the repository of all auspicious qualities, Of these, the Acārya expatiates on the first. viz., lordship over the two lands.</li>

<p>Let me be accepted in eternal and devoted service of the faultless (complete in all respects) Lord who holds sway over the nature, existence and activity of the three varieties of the conscious (cētana) and the non-conscious (acetana), who is not touched by the (five varieties of) miseries and the resultant virtuous and sinful actions; who is an ocean of naturally fitting hoardes of auspicious qualities (this section is the same as 4(iii) of Saraṇagati gadyam); who is the supreme Brahman and Purusottama (the most perfect person) who reclines on the serpent bed in Srirangam; my master who is complete (Not wanting in anything-faultless).</p>
<p>p</p>
<p>I, who have clearly understood myself to be ever subject to Your command; I who have tasted the sweetness of ever being in Your service; I who have only Yourself as the subject matter for my knowledge and devotion; I who have experienced You constantly without interruption; eager and anxious to be of immense and commendable service at all times and under all circumstances to You; with this eagerness generated by the pleasure of my experience of Yourself let me, the very personification of the desire to be of service, be accepted eternally for such service.</p>
<p>Comments: 1:- svadhinatrividha cētanācētana svarūpasthiti pravṛttibhēdam- holding complete sway over the variations in the nature, existence and activity of the three types of conscious beings (cētana) and three types of non-concious (acetan). The three varieties of cetanas are- the bound (samsari), the freed (mukta) and the eternally free (nitya). The bound are those who are susceptible</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>Śriranga Gadyam</p>
<p>to abridgement of their knowledge (ability to know and understand); who exist in happiness and misery resulting from their virtuous and sinful deeds. The freed are those who by the grace of the Lord have been freed from the bondage to the body which is responsible for the abridgement of knowledge; and consequently having an intellect which is fully blossomed, who exist in a state of eternal happiness in the service of the Lord enjoying their experience of the Lord&rsquo;s divine form and qualities engaged in all possible physical service; following the Lord, giving expression to the happiness in words &ldquo;Oh! I am His food&rdquo; (this implies pleasing service). The ever-free nityas are those who have never been stained by bondage unlike the muktas- who were once in bondage and freed after a long time and came close to the Lord. They have been engaged in ageless and eternal service to the Lord, eternally engaged in seeing, worshipping and praising Him, the foremost among these being Viśvaksēna, Garuda and Ananta (ādiśēṣa).</p>
<p>The three varieties of the non-conscious acetana are those characterised by total Purity (śuddha satva), admixed qualities (mixture of satva, rajas and tamas) and time, which decides when creation and destruction should occur. The material characterised by total purity is made up of five divine components (called pancōpaniṣaṇmaya- paramēṣți, puman, viśva, nivṛtti and sarva) totally pure (not admixed), changeless in nature, helpful to the protective activities of the Lord in His forms vyuha and vibhava. and self-revealing everywhere. This suddhasatva is the material constituting the Land of Bliss-paramapada; the admixed prakṛti is the material making up the worlds of men and the gods-Indra downwards and is characterised by an admixure of the three qualities satva, rajas and tamas ever susceptible to transformation (change), exisisting in different states dependent on the good and</p>
<p>(a) on ad,(hm</p>
<p>oldige one ofw soft br bind of love) sont planets a॥</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>bad actions of the souls embodied therin, capable of hiding (abridging) true knowledge of the embodied soul regarding the self, the Supreme, the goal, the means to the goal, the obstacles thereto and its own relationshiips to others. Time is different from prakṛti, single-natured, measureable by seconds, minutes and so on, and controls the existence of (changes undergone by)non-conscious matter and the embodied souls, their birth, growth and death. It does not constitute a controlling factor like this in the Land of Bliss.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s sway over all these consists in being the inner being of all and controlling them. Thus the fact that every thing is subject to the absolute control of the Lord emphasises that the Lord is the antarātmā (controlling inner resident-sariri and that everything else constitute His body-sarira)</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>klēsa karmādi aseṣadosa asamspṛṣṭam-It may be asked whether since the Lord is the soul and all else constituting His body, the faults and defects of the body would not stain the soul; the answer is &lsquo;No: the defects of the body do not touch the soul(the Lord)&rsquo;- klēśa-misery-causes which lead to it like ignorance, self-importance (ahamkara), greed, desire and anger; karmah-deeds which cause misery; adi-others, beginning with such faults; here is meant types of beings god(deva), man and so on with varying life. spans and differences in nature and intelligence associated with each type. aseṣadosa asamspṛṣṭam-untouched by all these faults; asēṣa includes susceptibility to change associated with acit (matter) and change in extent of jñāna as well as misery possible with the jivātma; asamspṛṣṭam not touched by- signifies that never was&rsquo;.</p>
<p>34 Am</p>
<p>svabhävika etc&hellip; Three types of qualities are meant here; the common ones, those which favour the asritas (those who seek protection) and those oriented towards the enemies of asritas; svabhāvika-natural like coolness of water and heat of fire;</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Śriranga Gadyamı</p>
<p>anavadhikātiśaya-each auspicious quality by itself being infini and wonderful; jñāna-ability to grasp (know about) all things at a times, that is, His ability to remember the difference in names an forms of the innumerable jivas created in different forms and th virtues and sins of each created being; bala-ability to support all H infinite creations by an infinitismally small portion of His powe aiśvarya-(being iśvara) ability to command all His innumerab creations according to their karma (virtuous or sinful deeds); viry: prowess-while carrying out creation, sustenance and destruction doing all this effortlessly and without visible change. He change other beings without himself undergoing the slightest change śakti-ability to confer activity on the living beings tending activity and engage them in activity; ability to make th &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; possible; ability to be the matter of creation- jaga upādānaśakti; tējas-making others subservient to Him-Only by Hi light do all luminous objects appear luminous.</p>
<p>Besides these six principal qualities, the twelve qualities c isvara favouring those (aśritas) who seek Him are then explained sauśilya-natural ability to freely mix even with the lowliest, totall unconscious of His infinite greatness. ``I am a mere man, son o Dasaratha&rdquo; Rāma told Brahma and other gods when they came t see Him after the death of Ravaṇa; vatsalya-affection; He remove the defects of aśritas as a cow licks out the dirt from the body o calf. He became a lowly cowherd and tended cows and calves (in Kṛṣṇāvatāra); mardava-softness. This physical quality enumerated in the midst of mental ones means a weakness-the inability to bea separation from those dear to Him, &ldquo;Rama could not get a wink of sleep when separated from Sita&rdquo; &ldquo;I constantly remember the swee words of Bharata coming from the depth of his heart&rdquo; so Rama kep saying with remorse after he sent Bharata away not fulfulling his</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>woman</p>
<p>request to come back to Ayodhya; ārjava-one-ness of thought word and deed particularly in wishing to be with His devotees; sauharda-always thoughtful of the welfare of devotees whether present before Him or not; samya-treating all devotees alike irrespective of being high or low in birth and conduct. Rāma accepted the hunter chief Guha as a dear friend; He was pleased to eat the fruits offered by Sabari. karunya-selfless sorrow at the distress of others, Rama was distressed at the grief of his subjects; He was distressed when sita was abducted out of the feeling &ldquo;a has been abducted.&rdquo; madhurya all-round sweetnes; appearing so to the victim even when He was about to kill. Bhisma welcomed Śrikṛṣṇa when He approached with the deadly wheel to kill him, &ldquo;Welcome! One with eyes like fresh blossomed lotus! Come on! I prostrate before you; put an end to me&rdquo;. gambhirya- His good intention towards devotees cannot be gauged. He gives of Himself and the capacity to enjoy that immensity. He is unmindful of the greatness of what He gives and the smallness of the one receiving; having done much He feels like having done nothing. audārya- generous-He entreats devotees to accept what He gives; &ldquo;All those who approach Me &lsquo;for worldly wealth or for salvation are truely generous&rdquo; (So Kṛṣṇa said in the Gita). Rāma was always eager to meet people who sought His help and having fulfilled their wishes, felt very happy.</p>
<p>caturya-cleverness, ability to hide defects of devotees even from Śri(His consort-their mother); He would remove doubts about His eagerness to protect (bring succour) and do good. In order to remove Sugriva&rsquo;s doubts, Rāma threw the huge carcass of the demon dundubhi miles across by a kick of toes; He split seven sāl tress in succession with a single arrow. sthairya-stability of purpose; even in the presence of thousands of foes He would not</p>
<p>ven in the presen</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>Sriranga Gadyam</p>
<p>flinch from the resolve to protect asritas. Though friends (allies like Sugriva dissuaded Him, Rāma declared. I will never reject a offered hand of friendship&rsquo; and accepted Vibhiṣaṇa, brother a Rāvana as a friend. Thus, these 12 qualities are concerned with Hi concern for aśritas</p>
<p>The next three concern the enemies of asritas, dhairya-ne caring for (not being afraid of) the foe. Even before he faced th mighty raksasa army of Ravana, Rama crowned his younger brothe Vibhişana king of Lanka. Such was His confidence in His ow invincibility. He destroyed the basic army- mulabala-single handed śaurya- ability to enter the enemy&rsquo;s place like His own an infliciting heavy loss. &ldquo;People saw the mutilated corpses a innumerable rakṣasas with their limbs strewn all over the place bu not Rama who moved so swiftly&rdquo;. parakrama-Valour When H Rama) moved with his bow in His hands, the rakṣasas were s tacinated by His valour that they did not realise that He was killin them.</p>
<p>Then are enumerated four qualities concerning asritas. Th means (of approaching Him) and the end (what He grants) satyakāmaḥ-kāma may be interpreted as desire or possession. On with eternal kama-desirable qualities and wealth providing enjoyment for asritas. Alternately it can mean His immense desir to do good to asritas. The flow of good intentions cannot b arrested satyasankalpa-He displays ever-new enjoyments (b giving of Himself) in kaleidoscopic array. kṛtitva-when the aśritas desire is granted, the fulfilment is His. Having crowned Vibhiṣan king of Lanka, Rāma heaved a sigh of relief and was delighted with a task completed; kṛtajñata-remembering a good act; the words seek your protection; I seek you as my all; I surrender my all t you&rdquo; makes Him remember only that and forget all else (all faults)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>ever remembering his own shortcomings. Though Kṛṣṇa protected Draupadi at her moment of dire distress (when she was about to be disrobed), He felt Himself eternally her debtor since He could not be there in person and assure her that no harm would befall her. Rāmā&rsquo;s sorrow that He could not fulfill Bharata&rsquo;s request (to abandon the forest-life ordered by His father and return to the kingdom) was immense-not for the love of kingship but for not fulfilling the request of a sincere aśrita &ldquo;He begged with his head-bowed; I could not grant his wish.&rdquo; adi-and so on-many others, asankhyeya gunagana aughamaharṇava-only some of His auspicious qualities have been enumerated; the unsaid is infinite, countless. Can one count the number of molecules of water in the vast ocean? So also the Lord&rsquo;s auspicious qualities. Karna&rsquo;s words during the great Bharata war: &ldquo;The qualities of the great and ever victorious Lord (Kṛṣṇa) cannot be enumerated completely even if all people in the world come together and talk for 10,000 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>parabrahmam</p>
<p>purusottamam-Well established parabrahmaman and purusottama in the vēdānta. parabrahmam-The Superior One who is immense or immeasurable (brahma), one who can make others immense like Himself&rdquo;.(brahmanatva) &ldquo;He makes others equal to Himself (Tiruvaimoli 8-5-2): &ldquo;Those who have become like Me by virtue of this knowledge are never destroyed. (Gita 14-2). So it is that He is pleased to grant that those who realise Him become similar to Him. purusottama-the person above everyone else. ``That suprerior person, distinct from others is called paramātmā. I am superior to the kṣara, the bound soul and to the akṣara (realeased soul). The śrutis and smṛtis therefore declare Me as purusottama the Highest Person&rdquo; (Gita 15-17). The word means &ldquo;He who gives all desired fruits-that largest-hearted person.&rdquo; sriranga sayinam- one need not be satisfied only by scriptura।</p>
<p>97Śriranga Gadyam</p>
<p>statements: one can feast the eyes</p>
<p>statements; one can feast the eyes with His reclining form in Śrirangam; such is His accessibility. asmat svaminam-by his reclining in this temple (Koil-temple is a unique apellation to Śrirangam), He has demonstrated His personal relationship (Lord) to me (servant). He has enslaved me by His auspicious qualities&rdquo; said Lakṣmaṇa of Srirama to Hanuman.</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>So far, the Acarya has talked about the Lord, the recipient of the service; hereafter, he refers to the self which is the seat of the service. prabuddhanityaniyāmya nityadāsyaika rasātma svabhāvoham-eternally subject to the Lord&rsquo;s command, ever at His service, having it as the supreme source of joy; realising the nature of the atma to be such. This indicates that self-will and diversion to others (other areas) would destroy the soul; tadēkaānubhava- having the mental experience of the Lord as the only subject matter for the mind; tadekapriyah-having made the Lord as the only subject matter for devotion. By this is indicated stages-parabhakti etc. which are the basis of God-experience. paripūrṇam bhagavantam nirantaramanubhūyaḥ- experiencing the omniscient Lord clearly and wholly without any interruption. paripūrṇānubhava is experiencing the Lord&rsquo;s essential self (nature), His form, His auspicious qualities and all His wealth as the subject matter for experience (loving meditation and mental vision). visadatama anubhava is the near fruition of the experience in terms of paramabhakti-equal to direct vision and direct experience of His presence; niranțaram-eternal; no admixture of others at intervals. tadanubhavajanita anavadhikatiśaya pritikarita aśēṣāvasth cita aseṣasēṣataika ratirupa-caused to be done by intense devotion born out of that wonderful experience; a personification of the desire (longing) to be of service under all conditions; desire to be the source (or seat) of service for eternity (as long as the atma does</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>exist); anavadhikātiśaya-exceedingly wonderful; the basis of eternal service; far more than in the preparative stages of parabhakti. aśēṣāvastha-all conditions-in the inner courts; in the formal court assembly, in the flowers garden while sporting, while enjoying water-sport in the swimming pool, in all Your different states in the highest (paramapada), in the sea of milk (vyüiha), in Your avataras (as Rama, Kṛṣṇa and so on) and as arca in temples. aśēṣaśēṣataika-serving in a variety of forms; for example, like adiseṣa who serves as the seat, bed, canopy, sandals and so on (stotraratna-40, First Tiruvandadi-53), like queen Kausalya who served her lord King dasaratha as wife, friend, sister, mother, depending on circumstances (Rāmāyaṇa-Ayodhya:- 12-68).</p>
<p>The second curņika (sentence) following conveys the surrender (śaraṇagati). In the first curnika the Acarya described and prayed first for the goal (prapya). Here, he conveys his imperfections, his having no other refuge, and his lack of virtues and formally seeks the Lord as the sole means to get acceted in His service.</p>

<p>2.Translation:- The operative part of the text is ``I seek your lotus feet as my refuge.&rdquo; Various epithets qualifying the &lsquo;I&rsquo; are enumerated. The Lord is then addressed with a few exclamatory epithets before the formal surrender.</p>
<p>Myself (I) whose essential nature is suitability to be ever commanded by Him, understanding this nature and ever thinking of it, meditating always on His great lordship and all His auspicious qualities, with a devotion which is a means to the service in the form of an intense desire to be of service in all forms under all conditions, possessed of ripe knowledge which would lead to devoted service, engaged in action in the form of service to Him, lacking as I am in personal qualities like virtue (satva) and firm faith (in Him and His commands), possessed as I am of qualities and conduct directly opposite to that enumerated and hence steeped in an ageless ocean of sin incapable of being crossed, with naturally endowed knowledge and lustre covered (screened) by inevitable association with prakṛti (material associations) which by nature is susceptible to continous change and is a mixture of the threefold qualities (satva, rajas and tamas), the inevitable association being ordinarily inseparable like oil in the gingelly seed and fire in firewood; (as a result of this association), bound inextricably by the rope or karma in the form of virtue and sin collected over ages out of ignorance; I who cannot find the means of over-coming this bond to samsara (birth and death) however long I may try; I take refuge in Ve</p>
<p>lotus feet as the only means of emancipation O, nārāyaṇa! ever associated with Sri! The refuge of all created beings! I seek your protection.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>Comments on 2: Earlier, the Acarya prayed for the prapya (the desired end). Here, he seeks refuge in the Lord&rsquo;s feet for the fruition of the goal of service, giving expression to his faults, his lack of virtue and his having no other saviour.</p>
<p>Being pleased with meditation of his self (as the servant of the Lord), after dwelling on the auspicious qualities of Bhagavan and talking of the nature of the service sought, the Acarya repeats what has already been said, from `svatma nityaniyamya&rsquo; upto &ldquo;nityakainkarya&rdquo;. Meditation on the self is desirable because of its subservience to the Lord; dwelling on his auspicious qualities is desirable because of His unique greatness; service unto Him is desirable because it is the result of Love towards Him. anavadhikatiśayasvamya-(His unlimited and great lordship) differentiates from conditional limited lordship. The authority of the father or the mother is limited to a few aspects of protection and is bound to end after a time. On the other hand, this lordship is for all aspects of protection and cares for the very existence of the person. The qualities arising from His lordship were dwelt with earlier (para 1). The basic lordship is talked of here. The devotion leading to the realisation of service is S parabhakti. tadupāyasamyakjñāna -knowledge about the true (well-defined) natures of the self and super-self, in the form of constant meditation, knowledge (devotion) in an advanced state-ready to yield results. samicina kriya- action based on such well-defined knowledge with proper renunciation; tadanuguna satvikāstikyādi samasta ātmaguṇavihinaḥ -though totally lacking in all qualities favourable to the action (karma) mentioned-qualities like control of inner and outer senses, absence of ego, conceit and so on, faith in the grace of the Lord (A true brahmin is naturally endowed with mastery over the outer senses, the mind, denial of bodily needs,</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>Sriranga Gadyam</p>
<p>purity, patience, honesty, general and refined knowledge and firm faith in the Lord and in the scriptures). duruttarananta tadviparyayajñānakriyānuguṇādi</p>
<p>pāpavāsanā mahārṇavān tarnimagnaḥ-earlier he mentoined his akincanyam (lack of virtue) and now he confesses his sins. (I am the storehouse of all kinds of offences). These sins, in the form of knowledge (understanding) inimical to the true jñāna and service mentioned earlier, are truly unlimited and unfathomable. He cries out at his state of immersion in this occan of sins and the propensity to commit more.</p>
<p>tilatailavat daruvahnivat durvivaica - durviveca - reference is made to the veiling of the nature of the atman due to association with prakṛti (identifying the body with the soul) which in turn results in a propensity to more sins. Two examples are cited to show that it is but rare that these two (prakṛti and atma) are clearly differentiated. Only the well-informed are able to so differentiate; like the presence of oil in gingelly seed and fire in the fire stick. (In olden days sparks of fire were obtained by vigorous churning motion with a variety of wood-arani.). Only by knowledge (imparted by a competent teacher) and the grace of God can one clearly see one apart from the other. The soul is so imbedded in prakṛti (hidden in it) that others cannot clearly see one separate from the other. The soul whose essential identity is knowledge, who is self-revealing, is hidden in prakṛti like oil in gingelly seed and fire in firewood (Śriviṣṇupurana); trigunakṣaṇa kṣarana svabhāva - with constant change and association with the qualities of satva, rajas and tamas as essential features; acetanaprakṛti vyāptirūpaḥ -having inescapable association with prakti characterised by ignorance; duratyaya bhagavan māyātiröhita svaprakasal with the nature of the atma veiled by prakṛti otherwise called maya. My maya is impossible to overcome&rdquo; declares the</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>Lord (Gita 7-14). prakṛti capable of wonderful transformations involved in creation is to be understood as maya and maheśvara (the Supreme Lord) as the possessor of (the director of) māya. (Svētāśvatāra Upanisat). The association between the atman and prakṛti, is the work of the all-powerful Lord. Only He can undo the knot. anādi avidyasancita anantaāśakya viśramsana karmapāśapragrathitaḥ - gathered ageless ignorance, inextricably bound by the rope of karma in the form of sin and virtue, which cannot be untied by anybody (but the Lord). So far, the enumeration of the storehouse of sin. The mention of papavāsanāmahārṇaväntarnimaghnam followed by bhagavan māyātirōhita svaprakāśah and then karmapasapragrahitaḥ means that ignorance which veils the characteristics of the soul is the result of sin (propensity to sin); this ignorance results in acts (karma - sin and virtue).</p>
<p>adṛṣṭasantarōpayaḥ-</p>
<p>anāgata anantakāla samikṣayāpi therefore, I, who do not find any means to cross this ocean of samsara (cycle of birth and death) over infinite periods yet to come; nikhilajantujātasaranya !- O! One sought as proper refuge by all beings who are born, not possessed of any virtue and not devoid of sin; like saying, &ldquo;Lord of all the worlds!&rsquo; and then &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;. (The idea is that since You are the refuge of all be ngs I seek refuge in You). śrimat - refers to the presence of Sri c&rsquo;oseby to intercede without giving room for punitive action on the basis of my past history of offences. Nārāyaṇa! Did you not care for the existence of this being and protect it though indifferent (or hostile) towards You? You have to favour me any way-looking at the presence of mother Śri as your natural protective grace. tavacaraṇāravinda yugalam- these lotus feet of Yours who are all merciful, easy of access most desirable and enjoyable; feet which are beyond a॥</p>

<p>Tranlation 3:- Though I am in this state (full of defects enumerated earlier), I beg of the Lord my acceptance in eternal service (to Him) in the firm faith that the all merciful Lord, heeding to my earnest request, will grant me the favour of steadfastness in everlasting service to Him urged by devotion resulting from the experience of the Lord.</p>
<p>Comments-3. ēvamavasthitasyāpi - To me whose state has been described earlier; that is, the storehouse of accumulated sin with no virtue; seeking Your lotus feet as my sole means of deliverance, having no other go. arthitvamātrēna - merely because I begged for this favour; not looking to my lack of detachment to desire or to my lack of eagerness to get the fruit; paramakārūṇikōbhagavan - the Lord; moved to sorrow by looking at my misery in the samsāra, not able to bear looking at my misery.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>Śrirama experiences intense sorrow looking at the misfortunes of his subjects&rdquo;. This is His nature (moved by the distress of others), and He has all the knowledge and power (all-knowing and all powerful) in the matter of granting deliverance (removing sorrow). Those two epithets paramakāruṇika and bhagavan explain the basis of His becoming the granter of the fruit on request. Now the nature of the request is dwelt upon. svanubhava prityōpanita ēkāntikātyäntika nityakainkaryaratirupa - the personification of the desire to be of undisturbed and eternal service unto Him urged by devotion generated by experiencing Him. nityadāsyam dasyatiti that He will grant the pleasure of eternal subervience (service till the atma lasts); viśvāsapūrvakam in firm faith in Him; nityakinkaratām prarthaye - the six chief qualities from jñāna (all-knowing), and sakti (all powerful) which are the basis of all His other auspicious qualities which come alive only when He is approached for the fruit. From this Lord (bhagavan) I beg (being accepted in) eternal service. dasyam (being a servant) and kinkaratā (being of service) refer to the same object.</p>

In the second Śrirangagadya, he addressed his prayer particularly to Sri Ranganatha who is the very lilmit of accessibility (most easy of access in arcă form). Here in the śri Vaikuntha Gadya, he offers his upadeśa to others regarding what could be expected in Sri Vaikuntha, the ultimate Land of Bliss (limit of Supremacy).</p>
<p>In order to condemn those bahyās and kudṛṣṭis (bahyas who do not accept vedic authority; kudṛṣṭi-who accept, but misinterpret the vedas to suit their views) who put forward the wrong means to reach God (wrong in his view); meditation of Śiva, Indra and such other than the Supreme, doing acts (karma) irrespective of a devata, mere knowledge (jñāna), a combination of karma and jñāna and mix up of scriptural texts to support their own views, Śri Bhāṣyakāra in his Śri Bhasyam aimed at showing that devotion (bhakti) towards the Lord was the most proper means of attaining Him. He pointed out that the correct meaning of Vedic texts is not what they said. In conjunction with logic and what is said elsewhere in the same Vedas, bhakti aided by karma (as ordained in the sastras) and jñāna (of the nature of the jiva and the Lord), is the surest means to attain God (bhakti, karma, and jñāna mean understanding and practice as ordained in scriptural authority-the</p>
<p>110</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>sastras). Though prapatti (surrender to the Lord) is latent in scriptural teaching, Śri Bhāṣyakara laid emphasis on bhakti. In the big (Saraṇāgati) Gadyam, the Acarya established that the ultimate means of attaining Him is through prapatti to save those whose powers of understanding are not sharp and who, thinking that the difficult means of bhaktiyoga is the sole upaya, may shirk away from it in fear. Because prapatti is an aid to the effective culmination of bhakti, people may feel that prapatti, unlike bhakti, may not be an independent means by itself. In order to dispel such doubts, the Acarya revealed in the srirangaga dyam that prapatti, a means independent by itself, not needing any other ancillary adjunct, easily practiced and in keeping with the subservient- to-God nature of the soul, is an excellent means to attain Him. Having a clear and sound grasp of the</p>
<p>Het means, it is now necessary to talk about the end attained by that means. This aspect is discoursed by the Acarya in detail in the Sri Vaikunthagadya- the glory of the Land of Bliss, the Lord who is experienced, and the service actuated by the experience, for the benifit of those who followed him. The means is talked about in detail for those fortunate few who were blessed with a taste for this upaya and the end, in all its details. While the first two are expressions of the inner experience of the Acarya and so serve upadesa, this gadyam is primarily a upadeśa with expressions of experience also.</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>There are six sections in this gadyam. First, the Acarya deals with the unique excellence of the nature, form, qualities and wealth of the object of refuge (saranya) and all the uniqueness of the saranya the very opposite of himself. Declaring his determination that for this soul to attain that object, there is no proper means other than prapatti, he takes refuge under the feet of the Lord, placing his faith in His qualites like saulabhya-ease of approach and</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>sausilya-mixing freely with inferiors. In the second section, h declares that though an once-expression of the intention is enoug to beget the end, he would keep repeating it to save the mind from digressing into other objects and also to pass the time fruitfully. I the third section, the Acarya describes the very pleasant arcirad path taken by the prapanna to the Land of Bliss crossing the lowe worlds (up to the Land of the four-faced Brahma), the uniqu decorations there, the presence of the Lord with His consorts in the beautiful Land, the beauty of Lord&rsquo;s form adored by the Consorts the divine jewels which add to the Lord&rsquo;s beauty, the divin weapans held by the Lord, and the congregation of the devote nityas and muktas who serve the Lord sheerly out of the joyfu experience of the Lord in all His glory described earlier. Thinking of the Lord served by the devoted souls, one should look forwar &ldquo;When am I to be blessed with the service of the Lord in thi manner?&rdquo; With having this fulfilled, one should approach the Lor and beg &ldquo;My Supreme Master! please use me in Your service fo eternity&rdquo; and eonvey one&rsquo;s being (atma) at His feet.</p>
<p>In the fourth section, the Acarya says that the Lord accept the supplicant as desired and the latter engages himself in usefu service unto Him. The fifth describes how the devotee keeps gazing at flicker of the eyelid</p>
<p>the Lord with rapture without even a without attention to anything else, making up for the very lon period lost without this happy service. The sixth sub-section describes the way the Lord enquires the welfare of the devotee how He bestows His cool sight (showering favours) and places Hi lotus feet on the devotee&rsquo;s head. The latter, crowned by this favour is immersed in joy and stays as the &lsquo;Lord of the empire of service unto the Lord.</p>

<p>I will delve deep into the nectarine Ocean that is Yamuna (his teachings) and will bring out the gem that is bhaktiyōga and show it out as best as I can for the experience of the devoted. The idea is that the Acarya wrill give out of the spiritual wealth left by Śri Alavandar for the daily experience of the devoted. The bhaktiyōga mentioned here is only prapatti which is the result of bhakti (sadhyōpāya). Later the acarya actually says that for infinite time there is no way of attaining His feet except through prapatti.</p>

<p>113</p>
<p>Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>Nārāyaṇa (nārāyanam), parigṛhya-having accepted Him;</p>
<p>manvānaḥ with deep conviction; nārāyaṇasya śrimat caraṇāravinda yugalam-Nārāyaṇa&rsquo;s auspicious lotus feet; saraṇam anuvrajēt-One should seek refuge as the sole means to the goal. Having accepted the peerless Lord Nārāyaṇa as the master, friend, and preceptor, wishing for eternal service to Him, with the deep conviction that refuge under His feet (prapatti) is the sole means (to attain the wished-for end), one should seek refuge at the lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa with the realisation that there is no end for the soul beyond this. The above gives the essence of the lengthy sentence. Now for a free translation: svadhina&hellip;.nārāyaṇam-Nārāyaṇa, who controls the nature, activities and well-being of the three kinds of the sentient (jivas) and non-sentient (matter); who is totally free from the faults like ignorance, karma-good and bad (virtue and sin), who possesses limitless wonderful auspicious qualities like (full) knowledge, prowess, and wealth by nature, who is the Supreme Lord; svāmitvēna&hellip;parigṛhya-having accepted Him, as master good friend and preceptor; aikantika&hellip;manorathaḥ-eager solely to be ever of service to His lotus feet (service to Him); tatrpaptaye&hellip;.manvanah-firmly of the conviction that to attain that end even for ages, there is no other means than seeking refuge (prapatti) under His lotus feet.</p>
<p>akhilasatva dayaika sāgarasya&hellip;.mahāvibhūtē bhagavatō nārāyaṇasya-who is most compassionate (ocean of compassion) to all beings; who is exceedingly miscible (mixing freely) with all people without any reference to desirable or undesirable qualities; who, by His very natural and extremely auspicious qualities, gladdens the hearts of all beings-devas, humans, animals and so on; who is a deep ocean of affection towards devotees; who feels it as the greatest pleasure to mix and freely exchange with all devotees; who has all the means of such as eternal infinite knowledge about all, all means of</p>

<p>114</p>
<p>sport (lila), and limitless wealth; possessor of the entire (all) worlds; of that great Lord (Bhagavan) Nārāyaṇa; śrimataccaraṇāra vindayugalam-most auspicious lotus-like feet; ananyātma sanjivanena-with the sole single-minded conviction that there is no greater end than this, one should seek Him as the only and sole</p>
<p>in as the only a means to attain the end (of eternal service unto Him).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>One should, for spiritual well-being, continuously (everyday) keep thinking of this (having adopted Him as the means to the end).</li>

<p>cētanācētana-the three con</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Comments: Text Section-1:- svadhina-refers to the state where all activities are under His control unlike those of others (cētana and acetana). &ldquo;The entire universe-movable</p>
<p>Stana and immovable-is in the custody of Kṛṣṇa&rdquo; All except Himself are under His control and command. What are these? trividha cētanācētana-the three types of souls, the bound, freed and ever-free, non-sentient-matter of this world, and of the divine, and time; their very nature, their qualities and activities and sthiti-existence. The nature of the soul (sentient, unchanging) and matter (non-sentient, undergoes constant change) are for ever defined as above. svarupa sthiti needess to say, this is their state (existence). Difference among the sentient (souls): unlike the singleness (only one soul-advaita) of the māyāvādins, we have it that according to the scriptural authorities One among many&rdquo; (kathōpaniṣat), Because of differences, we infer that souls are many. (some being happy and some miserable); Difference in nature: in being able to know, act, enjoy, being changeless, self-effulgent, and being His (seṣatva). Difference in activity: knowing, wishing, putting forth effort etc.</p>
<p>bhow</p>
<p>Differences among</p>
<p>less to say, is State</p>
<p>among the non-sentient:- the</p>
<p>the stages of</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>evolution-prakṛti (unmanifest); mahatahankära of matter; of units (second, minute etc) of time-of the unmanifest (karaṇa-cause) and manifest (karya-effect), which are different from one another. Differences in nature, non-effulgence, susceptibility to change, having different properties. Differences in activity-being the material for creation, ability to hide and show out.</p>
<p>The question arises; Masters like kings are also found to control assets, houses, servants etc. Is the Lord&rsquo;s control similar? No. klēśa karmadyāśēṣadōśa asamspṛṣṭam-these masters are subject to short-comings; faults due to karma and so on. The Lord is free from all faults. isvara is the person free form all shortcomings; klēśa-being subject to desire and hate; karma-virtuous and sinful acts; adi- the propensity to these. The Lord is not susceptible to any of these. These represent all that are bad (undesirable). He is absolutely free from all these. He is the very opposite of all that is faulty, lowly and undesirable; Not only that, He is the abode of all that is noble and auspicious. svabhavikānavadhikātiśaya jñānabalaisvaryavirya saktiḥ tējaḥ-&ldquo;His omnipotence, omniscience and divine activity (creation) are natural to Him&rdquo; (Svētāśvatāra). His qualities are eternal (Candōgya). His might, prowess, infinite knowledge and other qualities have not been acquired by effort or conferred as a boon by some god. They are ever-present and are part of His very existence. anavadhikatiśaya-Words fail to express all His greatness; they cannot be comprehended by the mind (Taitriya); &ldquo;He is the abode of the incomparably best of qualities&rdquo; (Tiruvaimōli 1-1-1). His qualities are infinite. What are these qualities? jñāna&hellip;mahārṇavam jñāna-He who comprehends everything at the same time and directly without any aid (nyāyatatvam). He sees and comprehends all things at all times by Himself. bala-ability to manage all the worlds effortlessly. &ldquo;The</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>supreme support of all the worlds&rdquo;(Taitriya). &ldquo;I bear the entire worlds by an infinitesimal part of my divine powers (Gita). aiśvarya-the ability to rule all the worlds under one royal umbrella. &ldquo;One Divine Ruler rules all the living and the non living&rdquo; (Svētasvatara). virya-valour-bearing and ruling the entire worlds without any strain. śakti-power to execute whatever that is undertaken without any hitch or obstacle. &ldquo;The power of the Supreme is diverse (undescribable)&rdquo; (Svētaśvatāra). &ldquo;None but Hari has the ability to control and protect (all these worlds)&rdquo; (Viṣṇupurana). The actions of the all pervading and infinite one are unrestricted.&rdquo; tējaḥ-even the very mention of His name strikes terror in foes. &ldquo;rāvana! I am so terrified at Rama&rsquo;s name that words like ratna and ratha beginning with letter &lsquo;r&rsquo;cause fear in me&rdquo; (Mārica-Rāmāyaṇa Araṇyakanḍaḥ). Or, ability to complete easily tasks which require intense effort. &ldquo;Only He is so celebrated&rdquo; (Taitriya)-the fame due to his power and valour may be included in tējah-splendour.</p>
<p>What is it that is characterised by the nature, form and qualities enumerated? paramapuruşam&hellip; the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa. parama-&lsquo;supreme&rsquo; differentiates the Lord from other sentient cetanas (purușa). parama indicates that there is none superior to Him. bhagavantam-this wonderful person is Bhagavan. Starting with svadhina&hellip;., functions like creation were enumerated; with jñanabalaiśvarya&hellip;- the six-fold essential qualities were enumerated. The Visņu Purāņa states; The name Bhagavan pertains to the chief cause of all causes, the Lord of all (sarvēśvara). bha-indicates that He is the creator (transforming the unmanifest into the manifest), and the one who is the protector, maker and annihilator. The qualities of jñāna, sakti, bala, aiśvarya, virya and tejas (all explained earlier) are included in Bhagavan. The fullness</p>
<p>117Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>of qualities and being the primal cause (creator) have thus bee enumerated. The lesser gods like Brahma are also, out of courtesy called Bhagavan because of their having some greatness. Here it specifically mentioned-Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa, The Upanisat say &lsquo;Out of nārāyaṇa is born Brahma; Out of Nārāyaṇa is born Rudra So He is the cause of Brahma and Siva and is their goal to narayana-the name that is the result of enumerating all that has bee enumerated, the essence of the Puruşa Sukta, included in each d the Vedas. &ldquo;I am the Person propounded in all the Vedas&rdquo; (Gita &ldquo;In the beginning, middle and in the end (conclusion) Nārāyaṇa spoken of in the vēdās.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far the unique greatness of Nārāyaṇa as the attainable go was dwelt upon. Now the prayer for service unto Him (bein accepted in service) is put forth in the text upto word endin tatpräptayē. svāmitvēna, gurutvēna, suhṛtvēna ca parigṛhya- A these go to make up the meaning of the term Nārāyaṇ svamitvēna- Lord and possessor gurutvēna-the preceptor-eas approachability of the teacher; suhṛtvena-friend-easy miscibility, indicates vatsalya-, affection.</p>
<p>ve Alternately, svamitvēna-the Lordship expatiated in th Puruṣasukta, gurutvēna-the dispenser of knowledge-Sankarsar Bhagavan (one of the five states of Nārāyaṇa), suhṛtvena-Narayana all&quot;Nārāyaṇa pervades everything inside and out&rdquo; He is the inner sou 17 of all-in men, devas and so on. He is the friend who resides in al 17of</p>
<p>This well-meaning friendship is referred</p>
<p>referred to by suh svamitvēna-the master servant or possessor-possession relationshi so essential for saranagati. gurutvēna-the preceptor-discipl relationkship; the preceptor teaches all that the disciple does no Thinknow but should know. suhṛtvena-He is the shelter, friend and th</p>
<p>supreme goal too. Easy accessibility and miscibility are indicate</p>
<p>118</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>parigṛhya-accepting Him in all these aspects. He is not accepted so just by one person (the saranagata). He is so accepted by the entire world; by the scriptures, by the teachings of all teachers, and in all other ways.</p>
<p>Having accepted Him as the Lord and Master, it is natural to think of oneself as the servant. The servant wishes for service, aikāntika &rsquo;tatpādāravindadvaya paricarya ēkamanōrathaḥ; aikāntika-intimate, personal. This may be linked with the tat-this association would suggest all natural relationships. When associated with tatpādāmbuja, the natural love and affection in serving the Lord intimately are indicated. tatpādāmbujadvayam- those two lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa. Though, by feet the entire form (Nārāyaṇa) is meant, the feet are unique as the landing place. The new born infant seeks the teats of the mother; so are the feet highly desirable to seek. Just like the breast overflowing with milk, the feet overflow with nectar. ambuja-lotus; very desirable not just like a bitter decoction taken as medicine; dvaya- two feet; inseparable; the means and the goal. &ldquo;I seek your two friendly feet&rdquo; says the devotee (jitantāstōtra). paricarya-service in all its manners; paricarya means activity (carya) pursued towards the superior; that is service. It also means all-round service; all pleasant activity starting with circumambulatio (pradakṣina). ēkamanōrathaḥ-leaving all other fruits (things wished for), the devotee seeks service as the sole goal. tatpi iptaye-to attain that goal of service. The ca here does not link up this fruit with something else. What else does it mean? It is for linking up with something not mentioned earlier. Service to You and to Your devotees. Association with servants of the Lord and service to them is as desirable, if not more, as service to the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>the goal w</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>So far, the nature of the goal was dealt with. The means</p>
<p>far, th</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>suitable to attain the goal and the mode of application are dealt with in the next text ending with saranam anuvrajēt. From tvatpādāmbujadvayaprapatte up to manvanha, the conclusion about the means is dealt with while from tasya to caraṇāravinda, the form (nature) of the means is explained. Furtheron, from ananyātma to adoption of the means anuvrajēt, the</p>
<p>is explained. tatpādāmbujadvaya-the goal itself is the means. If the goal and the means are identical, it suggests that the cause and effect, are identical. That would lead to the negation of effort and result (gain). Nagation of these means that there would be none pursuing these. If this be so, the sastras which teach in this direction would become meaningless and unauthoritative. How are all these contradictions to be reconciled? Since service (paricarya) at the pādambujadvaya (the two lotus like feet) is the end and prapatti, seeking (refuge) at the pādāmbujadvaya is the means, there is no contradiction. If service and seeking refuge (surrender) are the real upaya (means) and upēya (end), what about the authoritative texts &ldquo;One who knows Brahman becomes like Brahman&rdquo;, &ldquo;One who has known Brahman attains supreme bliss&rdquo; &ldquo;Seek Me alone as refuge&rdquo;, &ldquo;You alone should be my means&rdquo; which declare that the means and the end are both one and that the Lord Himself is both the means and the end? The answer is paricarya and prapatti are not different; The pleasure resulting paricarya and the grace-resulting prapatti are the same though they are (apparently) different by virtue of the qualifying features. One may ask; when one says aja (goat), gaja (elephant) mahiṣa (buffalo) &ldquo;Are not the objects different because of different characterising features?&rdquo; But here the characterising features (qualifying adjuncts) are different. In, for example, &ldquo;Devadatta is dark, young and well built&rdquo;, though the object is qualified by the characteristics in different ways, the object (Devadatta) is the same. This is like explaining &ldquo;He is the created;</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>He is the creator&rdquo; by saying that the combination of cit and acit in subtle (sūkṣma) form with Brahman is the cause and the same combination of cit and acit in gross (sthufa) form with Brahman is the effect.</p>
<p>prapatteḥ-&ldquo;Begging Him to be the means with intense faith in Him is prapatti.&rdquo; I have no association with the other means practiced with more difficultly. The faith and the prayer that the Protector is the means is prapatti. anyat-are there no means other than surrender-prapatti? From anyat to manvānaḥ (in the text), all other means are good for those who have the will for them (good water for those who can drink it). They are not suited to persons like us. anyat-all means like bhakti and its adjuncts karma, jñāna and all those other than prapatti. Are these not mentioned in the</p>
<p>Are these</p>
<p>scriptures as means to the goal? name-not for me; name asti-they are only for those with the will and capacity; not for one like me who is ignorant, incapable; steeped in karma (worldliness) and hence involved in successive births in different forms and steeped in sensual pleasures; hence the subject of the Lord&rsquo;s chastisement and not His grace. If not in earlier births, why not work up now by good acts and tapas seek His grace? kalpakōṭi sahasrēṇāpi-just as a ball of cobweb will not germinate even if soaked in water for a thousand days, I will not qualify for His grace (by my efforts) for eternity. sadhanamasti-the negative na occuring earlier (namē asti)- should be drawn here also; sadhanam na asti-it is not instrumental. Not only so; sadhanam na bhavēt is what is meant. It will not be the means for me iti manvanah-the present tense indicates that this thought-frame of mind-should be continuous.</p>
<p>tasyaiva bhagavatē nārāyaṇasya - That nārāyaṇa referred to earlier as bhagavantam nārāyaṇam, which reminds one of the qualities which make Him extremely desirable as the goal, and the</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Sri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>mewich</p>
<p>seat of such qualities. The released soul experiences the Supreme with all His admirable qualities&rdquo; (Taitriya). Here, by bhagavato narāyaṇasya, the qualities desirable in the upaya (means) and the repository of these is meant. Furtheron, the qualities and the Person meant in the terms bhagavan nārāyaṇa are dealt with. akhila satvadayaika sāgarasya - an ocean of compassion (daya) for all good causes; &hellip;.</p>
<p>akhila satva encompassing all living creatures without any distinction; daya- selfless feeling of compassion, unable to look on at the misery of others. Expressing anguish at He is others sorrows without any selfish motive. ēkasagarasya the sole</p>
<p>container of all the flood of compassion. anālocita guṇāguṇākhaṇḍa janānukūla amaryāda silavathaḥ- &hellip; natural quality of mixing with others, without any need to examine their good or bad nature; there are lots of people whose virtues and defects cannot stand examination by the mind; even to them He is available to ennoble them; He does not take cogniscence of their faults; Is it a virtue not to recognise existing good? When he does not look at faults fit for punishment, it follows that He does not look for virtues which make one deserve His protection. anālōcita - alōcana or consideration is examining the existence of virtues and faults; that is, whether one is ignorant or learned, theist or atheist, ethical or unethical, humble or haughty and so on akhandajana - all; not differentiating as deva or human; the four-fold caste or mixture of these; anukula - taking all these ashore in the right path in crossing the waters of samsara. amaryāda - maryada means limit; amaryada- limitless or infinite. sila - miscibility, when mixing with the low He does not consider His own superiority and nobility and the inferiority or lowliness of the other person; He mixes freely and fully. silavataḥ - vataḥ ever; this characteristic is always with Him; everpresent.</p>

<p>er eyes on th</p>
<p>b It may be asked; He may be prepared to mix freely with all; do others like Him? Do they not move away in dislike? deva tiryak manuṣyākhila janahṛdayanandanasya - moving the hearts of all; the wise as well as the idiotic. How? tu - there is a basis for this. svabhāvika anavadhikatiśayagunavattaya - by His natural, infinite desirable qualities; His auspicious qualities have already been extensively dealt with; what is new? the qualities of head and heart were dealt with; what is referred to now is the form the body.</p>
<p>the bod People addrss Śri Rama: &ldquo;O, Rāma ! you are pleasing to the eye as much as men desire; You are pleasing to the hearts of the gods.&rdquo; The youthfulness, brilliance and softness, all pleasing to the eyes, are referred to here (devatiryak&hellip; etc.,). It is said; &ldquo;The demoness (Surpanakha) was filled with lust when she set her eyes on the beautiful dark form (of Rama) resembling the god of love.&rdquo; She was captivated by His beauty and told Ravana &ldquo;Those beautiful youths with large lotus like eyes.&rdquo; The sylvan gods wished to become human maidens when they saw Rāma walking bow in hand.&rdquo; Such is His captivating form. tiryak - animal. hanuman told Sitā &ldquo;Rāma whose eyes are large like lotus petals captivates the hearts of all the living.&rdquo; Hanuman is referred to as &ldquo;Son of Vayu, the monkey, the animal.&rdquo; He exemplifies all three.; manusya - of men. The sages of Dandaka forest were struck with wonder at the extraordinary beauty and symmetry of Rama&rsquo;s form&rdquo;. adi - and so on; this means the non sentient; a stone melted and became a maiden (Ahalya). akhilajana - irrespective of whether friend or foe; hṛdayanandanasya-not like one who though good-looking kindles harsh feelings; &ldquo;He captivates the sight and the heart of men&rdquo;; &ldquo;He makes the hearts of all melt with emotion&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having lost the heart one has to send a messenger to it to return&rdquo; Such is His exceptional beauty.</p>

<p>With all this, has He any good feeling for those who seek and approach Him? aśrita vatsalyaika jaladhe - He considers even their faults as desirable; aśrita - those who sought Him. &ldquo;We are Your subjects the sages of Dandaka forest told Rama who assured them protection (against the demons); those who offer a leaf, flower, a fruit or even pure</p>
<p>་་</p>
<p>cwater with true devotion (Gita 9-26); those who</p>
<p>declare even once &ldquo;I am Yours; You are my refuge&rdquo; (to such, Rama, offered absolute protection); vatsalya; like the cow which removes filthy materials covering the just-born calf by licking it with relish; so friendly that He is not mindful of a mountain of faults but admires only the good aspects of the devotee; Rāma declared &ldquo;Though he may be the seat of all faults, the seeker (after protection) should never be rejected&rdquo; ekajaladhe -the single vessel (sea) full of all these qualities. Will he just help the seekers once and leave them? Will He not think that the help is for His own pleasure? bhaktajana - meditation with love is termed devotion (bhakti). The root bhaja (meditate upon, bow to) is used in the sense of service; good service is the essence of devotion so the wise say; love and service are marks of the devotee and prapanna - seeker of protection - samśleṣaika bhōgyasya- He does not brook a moment&rsquo;s separation from those truly devoted souls (who have no other purpose but love), His very sustenance, nourishment and pleasure.</p>
<p>nityajñāna kriyā aiśvaryadi bhōga samagri samṛddhasya when He has the pleasure of the company of these innumerable souls (devotees) He has all the facilities for such pleasure. He has full control over the eternal, ageless instruments of pleasurable experience their nature, form, activity, and ramifications; He is the Lord and possessor of these aids to enjoyments, His lordship is ful and complete. Well, if He has the instruments for pleasure and the</p>

<p>pleasures what about the place? mahāvibhūtēḥ - the possessor of the infinite expanse of the land of Bliss (nityavibhūti or paramapada) in contrast to the finite world of sport (lila vibhuti) which is a small fraction of the eternal. Is He just a lonely bachelor who has these infinite sources of pleasurable enjoyment? śrimat- He has a fit companion to find the shore (the limit) of the vast expanse in His first queen, Mahalakṣmi. The question arises, what is the pleasure arising out of the company of His consorts to Him who is the personification of bliss in the form of everfulfilled desires (avāptasamastakama)?. What is the need for a companion to Him?&rdquo; The answer is; His pleasure is the uplifting of souls. She is companion and aid in this by mediating (between the sinful souls and her Lord). May He be sought as such? caraṇaravindayugalam - most fitted to our nature; most desirable and pleasurable; a most beautiful combination which invites all to come; the two lotus like feet (are to be approached and held). How are they to be sought? ananya atmasanjivanena - with the conviction that nothing else can ennoble our soul. tatgata sarvabhāvēna-fully concentrated on this and nothing else. What is to be done? saranamanuvrajēt - seek them (Him) as the sole means to the goal with firm belief (of success). vrajet mentally seeking firmly. What is the need for anu? vraja indicates the knowledge; anu signifies the conviction Also anusyutam bhavēt the feeling and conviction should be without interruption. As is indicated by dvayamarthanusandhānēnasaha sadaivam vaktā- (Saraṇagati Gadyam the Lord&rsquo;s command), the vrajet frame of mind should be for all time.</p>

<p>the earth including</p>
<p>caturdaśabhuvanātmakam - seven worlds with</p>
<p>and above it, and the seven worlds below (atala, vitala, pātāla and so on); andam - The egg-shaped unit which is a vast expanse which contains all these fourteen worlds and the areas (āvaraṇas) which separate them, each ten times larger than the other. These seven avaraṇas are constituted by water, fire, ether, and the principles which make prakṛti; samastam - refers to all, there are millions of egg-shaped units in this vast universe; kārya, kāraṇa, jātam- constituted by various Principles each of which is related to the next as cause and effect; atitya - beyong all this mass of prakṛti (prakṛti, though eternal, is ever subject to change, creation and dissolution. śrivaikuntha is beyond the vast expanse of prakṛti and eternally changeless).</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>What is beyond all this? parama - vast; there is no upper limit to this (Vaikuntha); vyōmaśabdabhidēyē - called `parama vyōma&rsquo; ie., paramapada. This refers to the vastness - several times the size of the very vast prakṛtimandala; it is characterised by being absolutely clear; nothing remains hidden or unperceived; bramhādinām vāgmanasā agōcare - refers again to the vastness. The four-faced Brahma whose comprehension is far superior to our limited capacities cannot comprehend by mind or speech the vastness or the bliss of this Land. śrimati vaikunthe, - in the divine</p>
<p>m the ar land called Śrivaikuntha, contrary to our land of karma. There service to the Lord is eternal and continuous. vaikunthe - where there is no screen of ignorance limiting the knowledge</p>

The Lord cannot bear separation from these mahātmas even for the fraction of a moment; devotion and service are their hallmarks. apūritē - eternally populated by these souls; the land abounds with them. The nature of Vaikuntha is such that it is beyond the comprehension not only of Brahma but beyond the grasp of even these great souls. tēṣāmapi - even to those souls whose greatness in knowledge is be</p>
<p>beyond our grasp; paricchettumayogye - beyond their ability to comprehend. In what aspects? iyatparimaṇam- in area or volume (size); iyadaiśvaryam - in wealth (contents); idṛśaśvabhāvam of such nature; itipariccnēttumayōgye all these are incomprehensible even to those great (awakened) souls.</p>

<p>Land of Bliss. divya - the term divya characterises the uniqueness which is totally unlike what our mundane senses can realise. divya avaraṇa śatasahasra avṛtē - hundreds of thousands of fortifications. āvaraṇa is fortification. (This is not for same purpose that we think; there is no need for any wall there; it is only indicative of the wealth). It is in keeping with the immense wealth of the supreme Lord. Also although there is no need for any fear of danger to their beloved Lord, the devoted souls still are cautious. They fear danger where none exists such is the nature of their love and devotion. One should not think that there are only fortifying walls. The natural beauty is then described. divyakalpakatarupaśōbhitē - shining with rows of kalpaka trees which are most enjoyable; divyōddhāna śatasahasrakōṭibhirāvṛtē - The central area, the temple of the Lord, is surrounded by innumerable gardens which afford the playground for Sri Vaikunthanantha and His consorts. atipramāņē - in the vast expanse extending in all directions; divyayatane - in such a temple (residence).</p>

All these clauses qualify the innumerable gardens surrounding the temple of the Lord. Then follow a description of the tanks, ponds and lakes intended for aquatic sport which are described in detail, manimuktapravalakṛta sōpānaiḥ - with steps (leading to the water) studded with pearls, corals and other gems; divyamala amṛta rasōdakaiḥ - filled with a vast sheet of pure and nectarine divine water; atiramaniyadarśanaih, atimanōharamadhuras varaih divyandajavaraih akulaiḥ - populated by a large number of beautiful and sweet-throated birds of various kinds. antahsthah muktamayadivyakriḍāsthānōpasōbhitēḥ- diversified by decorative islands of sport studded with pearls; divyarajahamsavali virajitaiḥ- resplendent with spotless (white)</p>

<p>Text and Comments: 3J:- The description of the Lord&rsquo;s divine form is followed by the wealth of His attendants and His own qualities which please His devotees. The first reference is to His first deputy and personal secretary - Śri Sēnāpati Āļvān or Viśvaksēna.</p>
<p>sankalpamātrāvaklupta jagajjanmasthiti dhvamsadhike-the entire wealth of the Lord is entrusted with Śri Viśvaksēna who is capable of managing the creation, protection and destruction of all movable and immovable objects by his mere thoughts; Śrimati Viśvaksēnē - with Viśvaksēna (Senapati) who is born inheriting the immense wealth of service unto Him; nyasta samasta atma aiśvaryam- entrusted all the worlds in his sway. (The Lord delegates a॥</p>
<p>His powers to this trusted deputy, Śri e services of other close attendants follow) Viśvaksēna. The vainateyādibhiḥ- by Vainateya and others. Vainateya is another name for Garuda, the Lord&rsquo;s bird-vehicle; &lsquo;others&rsquo; refers to the innumerable attendants of different cadres, personal attendants like</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>Gajavaktra and his group; gananayakas- like Kumuda and his group; nirasta samasta samsarika svabhavaiḥ -who are ever free from bondage (samsara) by their very nature (these are called nityas-everfree; unlike the mukta who was in bondage over ages and freed by the Lord&rsquo;s grace). bhagavatparicaryā karaṇa yogyaih-born for service into His lotus feet; bhagavat paricaryaika bhogaiḥ-who are ever sustained by the pleasure of service to the</p>
<p>hogain-who are ever sustained by the Lord; nityasiddhaih-by the nityasūris, anantaih-countless to be numbered; yatha yōgam sēvyamānam-being served suitably by the above-mentioned.</p>
<p>ātmabhōgēna anusamhita parādikāladivya amalakōmala avalōkanēna! avalōkana: this refers to the graceful look of the Lord. This look, intended for eternity for His own (pleasure) rather than for others; exceptionally beautiful and fully blossomed; not mindful of any faults in others. (parādi - is a measure of time which is the span of the four faced Brahma&rsquo;s life which lasts over million of millions of human years). There is another common reading widely current-atmabhōgēna ananusamhita paradikāla- who is not conscious of the passage of long ages in His own pleasures; the whole time passes as an instant. viśvam āhlādayantam-pleasing the entire worlds (with His look of grace-divyakaṭākṣa). The following, as well as the aforesaid atmabhōgēna qualify bhagavantam nārāyaṇam. iṣadunmilita mukhambujōdara vinirgatēna- (with words) emanating from the partly opened fine mouth; divyanana aravindaśōbhajanakena- adding to the beauty of the mouth as if decorated with jewels; divya gamabhirya audārya madhurya ādi anavadhika gunagana vibhuṣitēna- embellished by admirable characteristics like audibility, clarity, meaningfulness, sweetness (of voice), grace and other desirable qualities; atimanōhara divyabhavagarbhēna - pregnant with pleasant ideas pleasing to the</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>Sri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>mind; divyalilā ālāpa amṛtēna - with nectarine words indicative of His pleasure; akhilajana hṛdaya antaraṇi āpūrayantam- filling the innermost recesses of the heart (of His devotees) with the nectarine sweetness of</p>
<p>bhagavantam His meaningful adwords; nārāyaṇam-Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa, the auspicious and the opposite of all that is lowly;</p>
<p>dhyanayōgēna Dṛstava-having realised Him through the inner mind (by meditation). The words &lsquo;dhyanayōgena dṛṣṭvā&rsquo; appear to suggest realisation by the vigorous discipline of bhakti, Does it mean that the earlier words &lsquo;saranamanuvrajet (seek refuge by surrender) are meaningless? Obviously it refers to realisation through devotion which is inherent in the surrender. What do the words dhyanayogēna dṛṣṭva actually convey? - having seen (realised) Him in the same manner as by disciplined bhakti. It can also be the result of the fruition of the constant remembrance of the surrender as a means of passing the time pleasantly as mentioned in &ldquo;pratyaham ātmōjjivanāya ēvam anusmarēt - (Clause 2-this gadyam.)</p>
<p>xt step</p>
<p>3K:- The next step in approaching the Lord is then described starting from tatōbhagavato- remembering the true relationship between the Lord and the self; His eternal lordship and one&rsquo;s eternal servitude (as His possession and His body). The eagerness and expectation of the bliss is now described by the sentence beginning with kadaham. kada-when is it going to be? the eagerness and anxiety are obvious. aham-I who by faultless means (He Himself is my means and goal) am confident of realising Him, itching to be admitted into His service; bhagavan nārāyaṇa - Bhagavan Nārāyaṇa whose qualities do not allow one to remain passive (which drive one towards Him) and who is the rightful goal (by virtue of His being the Lord and master); mama natham - my proper Master,</p>
<p>140</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>man Gadyatrayam</p>
<p>mamakuladaivatam - our master by family succession (for countless generations); mamakuladhanam my saviour in all emergencies obtained through proper succession; (kula-means family succession through many generations); mamabhōgyam -most enjoyable to me; mama mataram- providing sustenance like one&rsquo;s mother; mama pitaram- who is the cause of raising me, mindful of my good; mama sarvam who is all to me as in the upaniṣadik sentence mātāpitābhrāta nivāsaḥ śaraṇam suhṛt gatim nārāyaṇa (narāyaṇa is my mother, father, brother, place of residence, sole means (for salvation), friend, and my goal) and similar sayings. sākṣāt karavāṇicakṣuṣā- when shall I actually see Him with my eyes as in the vedantic sadapasyanti&hellip;.&rdquo; the eternal beings keep seeing Him continuously. (This distinguishes the mental realisation mentioned earlier which is not actual physical seeing). kadāham bhagavatpādambujam sirasādhāra isyami-when shall I bear the two most enjoyable (it is a very desirable experience) lotus feet of the Lord, my chosen master, on my head? (cf. Stōtraratna-31:-) -0, Trivikrama! when will your two lotus feet decorate my head? when shall I approach (enter) the two lotus feet of the Lord, being rid of taste in other worldly pleasures and devoid of love and hate associated with worldly life (these being) born out of the taste in the service of</p>
<p>of the Lord at min His feet. kadāhambhagavatpādāmbujadvaya paricaryāśayā nirasta samasta sāmsārikasvabhāvaḥ tatpadambujadvayam pravēkṣyāmi ? - When shall I be graced by the cool gaze of the Lord&rsquo;s eyes and be commanded by Him in His sweet friendly and clear words in His service? (cf. tiruvaimōli 8-5-7)- itibhagavat paricaryāyām āśāmvardhayitvā-having nourished my desire for service unto the Lord by thoughts as outlined above.</p>

<p>Text and comments:- 4 The next sentence (4) says that the supplicant will, after acceptance by the Lord according to his request will ever be engaged in His service. tataḥ- after the conveyance of the self to the Lord (after the surrender); bhagavataḥ by the supreme Lord, Purushottama, by himself voluntarily, as prayed for by the supplicant; atmasanjivanēna avalōkanena- by the look which is the basis of spiritual ennoblement (uplift); amaryādaśilavatā atiprēmānvitēna avalōkanēna-a very loving and affectionate look indicative of his extreme miscibility, avalokya - conferring grace (the look-kaṭākṣa showers grace); sarvadeśasarvakāla sarvävasthōcita atyanta sēṣa bhāvāya- for eternal servitude at all times, places and under a॥</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>Śri Vaikuntha Gadyam</p>
<p>Lof</p>
<p>circumstances; svikṛtaḥ anujñātaśca- having been accepted and permitted (commanded); bhagavantamupäsita- stay before the Lord expecting His pleasure for command or singing His praise mindful His most desirable and auspicious qualities; atyantasādhvasavinayāvanataḥ kinkurvāṇaḥ kṛtānjaliputaḥ- in great humility, with folded hands and bowed head expressive of one&rsquo;s wish for service.</p>
<p>Vice.</p>
<p>Text and Comments: 5-The supplicant will spend his time gazing at the Lord with extreme joy resulting from the pleasant experience. tataśca-furthermore; anubhūyamānabhāvaviśēṣaḥ experiencing the greatness of the Lord as the protector of the universe, and his nature and essential qualities starting with His purity (not stained by contact with the lowly and sinful); niratiśayaprityā- with overflowing and incomparable affection; anyatkincit kartumdṛṣṭam smartum aśaktaḥ- so stupified by the joyous experience that one is rendered incapable of seeing, doing, or cognising anything else; this state is like that of Sita who could not utter a word because of excessive joy when Hanuman conveyed to her the news of rama&rsquo;s victory in battle over Ravana; this is also comparable to the state of the released soul which does not look back on things worldly. punarapiśēṣabhavamēva yācamānaḥ- out of fear that such a sweet experience may not last, begging again</p>
<p>that the service should last eternally; bhagavantameva- Śri Vaikunthanatha Himself; avicchinna strōtōrūpēņa avalōkanēna- uninterrupted gaze like a continuous flow (of oil for example); avalōkayan asita - remain gazing at the Lord, as in the candogya upaniṣat referring to the released souls in vaikunntha - &ldquo;they do not dine; they do not drink; they constantly enjoy the nectarine sweetness of gazing at Sri Vaikunthanātha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>though accepted in se</p>
<p>In Text and Comments: 6-He will remain there crowned in the</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>empire of service to the Lord; tatōbhagavatā&hellip;āhūya- refers to the gracious look and smile of the Lord at the supplicant, inviting him who is hesitant to approach near; being conscious of his own lowliness against His immeasurable greatness (What is His greatness? What am I to go near Him) and by His kind and gracious look and smile inviting him to come near in a sweet voice a॥</p>
<p>to com unique to Himself and removing all mental uneasiness. samastaklēśāpaham- capable of removing all worldly misery. (the following qualify His lotus feet); niratiśayasukhavaham-extremely comforting. atmiyam-His own; śrimat extremely desirable; pādāravindayugalam-two identical lotus feet; sirasikṛtamdhyātvā- assuming that they have been placed on his head; amṛtasägara antarnimagnaḥ- as if immersed in the nectarine occan of bliss; sarvavayavaḥ sukhamāsita- remain feeling the joyous experience throughout the body.</p>
<p>The above is an account of what the supplicant is rewarded with by the Lord-rather the experience awaiting him when release from body is due to extinguish his mundane existence and transport him above. The person who surrenders himself totally to the Lord, when he leaves this world of prakṛti is transported to the Land of Bliss. He approaches the Lord surrounded and served by the immortals of that world and gets accepted in His service after due supplication, and stays there ever happy in that service. As long as one is alive in this world one should keep thinking of the coming experience in the confidence that the Lord is sure to grant it. It is the practice of our elders to meditate on the last portions of śrivaikunthagadyam every day before reitiring to bed.</p>
<p>Thus ends Śrivaikunthagadyam and the commentary.</p>
<p>Hail! the glory of Sri Periyavāccan Pillai !</p>
