The great Apostle Bhagavad Rāmānujācārya who flourished in the eleventh century, postulated Bhakti as universal medium through which one could, not only liberate himself from wordly tribulations but also attain the supremely blissful abode of the Lord Srimannārāyaṇa. 

Among the stupendous works of Ācārya Rāmānuja, Gadya-traya, an encomium of infinite virtues and attributes of the Lord, sung in prose- poetry. This Magmum Opus of the great Ācārya has all prose-lyrical nuances. 

As the name suggests 'Gadya-traya-triad of Gadyas' (Proses) is comprising three gadyas such as śaraṇāgati Gadya, Śrī Ranga Gadya and Vaikunṭha Gadya. 

In the first of the Gadyas, Śaraṇāgati, there is the conversation between Acārya and the Lord Srimannārāyaṇa Himself, wherein 'Prapatti'- Utter dependence on the Lord, appreciated as the only way to 'release' to be with the Supreme Lord, proffering service unto Him in 'paramapada', abode. Ācārya Rāmānuja has detailed here about the ways the supreme of utter devotion unto the Lord. 

In second of the Gadyas, Śri Ranga Gadya furthering the thought of the first, Rāmānuja has put forth elaborately and deeply the desire to serve the Lord, begs of Him to bestow unflappable devotion to the Lord. 

In the last of the Gadyas Vaikuṇṭha Gadya, Ācārya Rāmānuja presents the discription of supremely beautiful abode of the Lord, which as a ultimate Goal attainable, if the sceker of ultimate joy, adopting the path of devotion to Lord, to reach it. The crux of this work emphasizes the complete self - surrender to the Lord, as the cause of ultimate bliss.
