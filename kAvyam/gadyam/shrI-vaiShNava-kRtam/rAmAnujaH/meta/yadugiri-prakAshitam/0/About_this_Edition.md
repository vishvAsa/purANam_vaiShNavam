+++
Since 1977, the Academy of Sanskrit Research, Melukote, has been the torch bearer of our vast and rich Sanskrit cultural heritage, especially in the sphere of Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy of Śri Rāmānujācārya. The Academy has brought out many of the old Sanskrit works into the public domain that are easy to read, understand and contemplate. 

The Gadyatrayam is a prose-poetry on the exalted dvaya-mantra, mantraratna - which, together with stotra-ratna (by Swāmi Ālavandār) and purāṇa-ratna (Viṣṇupurana) that propounds the essence of Śri Vaiṣṇavism.+++(5)+++ Gadyatrayam was published by our Academy in the year 2009. The first edition of Gadyatrayam was a tremendous success among national and international readers and lovers of Indian philosophy, especially, classical Sanskrit literature, and we are proud to convey that the book ran out of print in a very short time. The demand for the publication of the book has increased globally and the Academy is receiving requests from all the quarters of readers for a re-print edition of the book. Hence the Academy has re-printed Gadyatrayam in 2014 to fulfill the requests of our valuable readers. 

On this occasion, the Academy requests all the scholars and readers to read and meditate on the knowledge conveyed by Gadyatrayam and experience the bliss that is felt within oneself. 

The patrons for this great work are the Management of the Academy and the State Government of Karnataka. The Academy is very much grateful for the contributions made by the scholars of the Academy, the printing team, Art designer and the binders of the book, for making the re-print of the auspicious Gadyatrayam to happen on time. 

We look forward to enterprising years ahead as we have several good and rare publications to be brought out in the year of millennium celebration of our Humanitarian Acārya par excellence Bhagavad Rāmānujācārya in 2017.
