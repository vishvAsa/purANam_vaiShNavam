Alamelu Manga is the Consort of Sri Venkateswara of the
‘Seven Hills’. She is also named Padmavathi. The Shrine where
this Divine Deity is situated is called Tiruchanur.
This place is situated at a distance of 5km from Tirupati.
This Temple is seen always filled with devotees who visit
Tiruchanur after the Darshan of Sri Venkateswara of Tirumala.
According to Mythology, Srinivasa descended to Bhuloka
(Earth) in search of Sri Mahalakshmi who left Vykuntha in anger.
But he could not find her. Inspite of marrying Padmavathi the
daughter of Akasa Raju, who was herself par excellence of
Lakshmi, Srinivasa was in deep anxiety because he was deprived
of Mahalakshmi’s presence. To his relief, he came to know that
Sri Mahalakshmi was in Kolhapur (Maharashtra), and Srinivasa
left for Kolhapur and did Penance to procure her, but all in
vain. Later a voice (Akasavani) was heard which directed
Srinivasa to Suka Maharshis’s Ashram. It asked him to build a
Lotus Pond and do Penance on the banks of ‘Padma sarovara’
to get Mahalakshmi. Following the words of Akasavani,
Srinivasa reached Tiruchanur, built a Padmasarovara and did
Penance for Twelve (12) long years. As a result, on the day of
Shudha Panchami of Kartika masa, Sri Mahalakshmi took
incarnation in the thousand petalled Golden Lotus on Friday in
Padmasarovara. She became famous as ‘Sri Padmavathi’, for
devotees. Srinivasa took her to his chest and left for Tirumala.
But as per the request of Gods, Sri Mahalakshmi took the form
of Archamurthi and is in Tiruchanur taking the name
‘Padmavathi’ and ‘Alamelu Manga’ and She is blessing the
devotees.INDEX

Author's Note
Even while realizing that my capacities are inad-
equate, I ventured on this difficult work, as it is Lord
Venkateswara who Himself made me work on this
project. This is a humble attempt to recreate in an-
other language, as far as possible, closest and faith-
ful, to the original text. A sincere attempt is made to
bring out the spirit of the text. I am deeply beholden
to the authorities of T.T.D., Prof. Ravva Sri Hari, the
evudite scholar and a SAHRIDAYA, for giving this
good opportunity. I thank Sri C.Subba Rao, learned
scholar in Sanskrit and English for helping me in trans-
lating some Sanskrit words and Annamacharya's
Kritis. My wife Mrs. Uma Devi carried out the typing
- half the work - with great patience. It is true beyond
doubt that had she not done it, this work would never
have seen the light of the day. I am greatly indebted to
her forever, for this.CHAPTER-1
TIRUCHANUR
In this book, let us know the most revered story
of Alamelu Manga and about Tiruchanur, where the
Universal Mother took Her incarnation in this
Kaliyuga. This place, which is presently known to us
as Tiruchanur means- Tiruchana meaning Sri Kantha.
This is the place where Sri Mahalakshmi, the Abode
of Wealth took Her birth. It was called 'Tiruchana
Uru' - In course of time, it became Tiruchanuru in
popular imagination.
In the ancient time, it was the Ashram of Sri Suka
Maharshi. In course of time, it came to be transformed
as Sri Sukanur and Tiruchukanur and Tiruchanuru. It
is the Holy Place, where Rishis like Sri Suka performed
penance for 'Loka Kalyana'. It is so acclaimed as a
Holy Place, where Parasara, ( the grand father of Sri
Suka) did penance in a nearby place called
Yogimallavaram and it was believed that Lord
Venkateswara performed penance on the banks of the
Holy Lotus Pond, for winning the Love of Sri
Mahalakshmi. As a result of His timeless Penance,
Alamelu with over thousand Petals has Originated;
She is called Padmavathi as She originated from the
Petals of this Lotus Pond. Thus, the Universal Mother
became VYUHALAKSHMI; as She is present in
Swami's Bosom. As Alamelu Mangamma is wor-
shipped as ARCHAMURTHI, this place is also known2
3
as Alamelu Manga Pattanam. Around the same time,
when Alamelu Manga became Swami's
VYUHALAKSHMI, another important event took
place: Swami married Padmavathi, the daughter of
Akasaraju, the Emperor of Narayanavanam and the
story of their marriage goes like this: In Tretayuga,
during Sitalakshmi's sojurn in the forest, when
Vedavati, (i.e., Vedalakshmi) was forcibly taken away
by Ravana, Sitalakshmi prayed Sri Rama to marry Her.
Sri Rama, who was devoted to only one wife, assured
Her that He would marry Vedavati in Kaliyuga when
She would be born as Padmavathi and when, He Him-
self takes the incarnation of Sri Venkateswara. Thus,
accordingly, He married Padmavathi in Kaliyuga. He
left Vaikuntham and came down to Tirumala to fulfil
the desires of His devotees.
Vaikuntham vaa parityakshye
Nabhaktaam styaktu mutsahe
Meiti priya himadbhakta
Iti sankalpavanasi
However, since He was separated from Sri
Mahalakshmi, feeling deeply anguished, He appeared
in the Unique Incarnation of Varahavatara.
Sri Mahalakshmi descended from Sri Vaikuntham
and settled in Kolhapur Kshetra, as a result of the test
of Bhrigu Maharshi. She came and settled there in huff.
Lord Venkateswara prayed to Sri Mahalakshmi and
according to Her own wish, She originated as Alamelu
Manga in the Ashram of Suka Maharshi, on the banks
of the river Swarnamukhi. "Alarmel Manga" means a
Holy Goddess shining on the Lotus. Hence, She is
called Padmavathi. When Swami is Himself yearning
for Her Grace, what about the ordinary mortals like
us? Therefore, we must pray to Her with great Bhakti.
First we must visit Tiruchanur to seek Her Blessings
and pray to Her to see that Swami fulfils our desires,
for She is present in His Bosom, Always Kind and
Ready to protect the devotees. We should pray to Her
without inhibitions or fear or sense of shame. She will
fondle us like a child if we submit all our prayers to
Her with sincerity and obedience. She always helps
Her devotees.
She is the Eternal Source of Love and Kindness.
She sees that Swami sanctions the desires of Their
devotees. She is present as VYUHALAKSHMI in
Tirumala and as Alamelu Manga or Padmavathi in
Tiruchanur as ARCHAMURTHI.

innate capabilities are limitless. She bestows Her bless-
ings to the devotees, who deserve them, according to
their capacities.
Annamacharya in a moment of divine celebration,
praises Her like this: "Oh Mother of the Universe! You
are the Royal Consert of Swami. Only You are ca-
pable of protecting us by Your Omniprescence; You
are the Mother of All Gods, Manmatha and Lord
Brahma too, You are the Treasure of Kindness.
Kamadhenu and Kalpataruvu are Your sisters, while
the bright and delightful Chandrudu(Moon) is none
other than Your brother, You were born in the "Sea of
Milk!" Swami is present as Seshasai in the "Sea of
Milk". Annamayya tells us their inalienable nature in
another context: "Oh Mother, Alamelu Manga! You
and Swami are one and the same. You are Swami's
incarnation! Your Blessings are Swami's Blessings.
You are eulogized by revered Rishis". She is Eternally
present in the Divine Self of Swami. Swami is the God
of All Gods, He is the BRAHMANDA NAYAKA-
Benefactor of the Universe and Destroyer of all our
fears and agonies of life and our saviour. Alamelu"Sri" means the Giver of riches. She is the Royal
Consort of Srimannarayana, the Noblest of Mankind
and She is known as Sri Maha Lakshmi, Maha
Saraswati, Maha Kali and Parvati. She is worshipped
by various names as Sri Mahalakshmi, Lakshmi, Pad
malaya, Padmakamala, Sri Hari Priya, Indira, Loka
Mata, Mother, Ksheerabdi Tanaya, Ramaa, Bhargavi,
Lokajanani, Ksheerasagara Kanyaka. "Lakshmi"
means a particular use, benefit, growth and welfare
and God's benediction-as mentioned in many ways in
Rigveda. The meaning of each of these words is infi-
nite. Lakshma means a symbol or a sign of Something
Eternal. Hence, She is called "Lakshmi", as she signi-
fies Eternal Love of Srimannarayana. She represents
the Happiness and Joy of the Lord, who is Her True
Embodiment of all that is Truthful and Eternal. She is
present in the Bosom of Sri Mahavishnu as Sri Vatsam,
symbolizing Swami's Eternal Kindness and Love to-
wards His devotees.
CHAPTER-2
SRI MAHALAKSHMI6

Hence, of all His names, the name Srinivasa is
very significant. It means "Sri" is present in His Abode,
that is His Bosom.
Sritva swanyissarvai, srayasi ramanam sansrita girah
Srunoshi preyamsam sritajana vachassravayasicha
Srunasyetaddoshan janani nikhilan, sarvajagateem
Gunaih srinasi twam tadihabhavatim sririti jaguh
She is present with six grand qualities. She is
present at all places, at all times and in all situations.
She is always present in Srimannarayana's Bosom,
first, She listens to the prayers of the devotees and
conveys them to Srinivasa to makes Him fulfil their
desires. Thus, She removes the sins of all Her ardent
devotees and makes His world an Eternally Beautiful
place of Happiness and Fulfilment. Hence, She is
known as Chichakthi (i.e., both the Knower and the
Known as mentioned in the book "Lakshmi Tantra").
It means that She is the Eternal Wisdom and Gnana.
She is the true wisdom of the Ultimate. She is also
worshipped as Kundalini Sakthi-meaning-the only
True, Eternal and complete form of "Ananda". She is
a power, without any form or material substance as it
is a pleasure beyond ordinary reason or cause or re-
sult, as She is the symbol of Sri Mahavishnu's
Sankalpa-Vikalpa Rupalu (forms of will to create and
transform) and She is the word, both movable and
immovable experiences.

-Jayakhya Samhita
Her relationship with Him is like the relationship
of sun with His rays and sea with its tides. As in
LAKSHMITANTRA GRANTHAM, She is the energy
and the Power of the Entire Universe! She is present
in all the cosmic events and in all the different forms
of His Universe - consisting of all Great Saints, Noble
Men and Women, Crops and Plenitude of wealth. It is
also mentioned in MATHSYA PURANA that She is
present in many forms like Parvathi, like Rudrani for
Rudra in Kailasa,in Heaven like Sachidevi as Indrani
for Lord Indra, in Satyaloka, Saraswati as Brahmani
for Lord Brahma and for Agnideva as "Swahadevi" in
Swargaloka, She is known as All of Wealth i.e., Sakala
Sampathswarupini, in Nagaloka as Nagalakshmi, for
all the kings and emperors and monarchs, She became
their begetter of kingdoms (Rajyalakshmi), according
to their capacities, Gruhalakshmi for all the house-
holds, besides She is present all over the world, in
many forms and modes. We find these descriptions of8

Sri Mahalakshmi in all Her Grandeur and Benevo-
lence in DEVIBHAGAVATHAM and BRAHMA
VYVARTHA PURANA GRANTHAM.

She also appears as noble housewives and holy
and noble women, as wealth in all houses and happi-
est, joyful and welcome modes of presence in all the
houses. All Puranas proclaim that She is present in all
the houses as transcendental Spiritual Self.
She performs five valuable functions by Her
Ownself.
Tirobhava sthata srishtih
Sthitih samhriti reva cha
Anugraha ithi praveetam

They are known as "KARMA PANCHAKAM' and
they are as follows: (1) Creation (Srusti) (2) Preserva-
tion (Sthithi) (3) Favour (Anugraham) (4) Destruc-
tion (Samhrithy) (5) Disfavour (Thirobhavam) or de-
struction. To carryout these functions, She is bestowed
with the capacity of the Ultimate; this Ultimate is
known as "Sri Mahavishnu".
Shangunya vigraham devam
Tadrisyacha sriya yutam
-Ahirbudhnya samhita
This Ultimate, who is called Srimannarayana has
six attributes. They are 1. Gnana (Wisdom)
2.Aisvaryam (wealth) 3. balam (Strength) 4.Sakthi
(Power) 5. Veeryam (Prowess) 6. Thejassu (Bright-
ness) all these attributes are inalienable and present in
Sri Mahalakshmi as His Internal Qualities. These
Qualities are divided into two categories. They are:
1. In it’s quiet, transcendental mode, it is Gnana (Wis-
dom), Aisvarya (wealth) and sakthi (Power): 2. In their
Kinetic form, they are: Strength, Prowess and Bright-
ness.

Whenever Sri Mahavishnu takes incarnation in
this world She would also appear in this world as His
part. She does not act independently as She has no
separate identity. We find a detailed description of Her
Avatars in the valuable books namely JAYAKHYA
SAMHITHA, LAKSHMI TANTRAM, SRI PRASNA
SAMHITHA. She appeared as Sri, Keerthi, Jaya and
Maya, on various occasions- but in truth, they repre-
sent the Royal Consorts of the Four Avatars of Sri
Mahavishnu as Vasudeva, Sankarshana, Pradyumna
and Anirudha. Besides these, we also come to know
in the book called VIHAGENDRA SAMHITHA that,
these four names, She also took incarnation in eight
different names, according to the context. She also
appeared in many incarnations as, 1. Sri; 2.
Kameswari; 3.Kaanti; 4. Kriya; 5.Sakthi; 6.Vibhuti;
7.lccha; 8.Preeti; 9. Rathi; lO.Maya; 11.Dhee;
12.Mahima, depending on the need of the situation to
spread the message of Loka Kalyana. But we should
realize that these Avatars are none other than incarna-
tion of Sri Mahavishnu as His Sakthi Swarupa. It is
also
mentioned
in
the
book
called
LAKSHMITANTRAM. On many occasions, Sri
Mahalakshmi took incarnation on Her own indepen-
dently. She appeared in Her Satwaguna as Sri
Mahalakshmi, in Rajoguna as Krishnaa, in Tamoguna,
as Brahmi. In the book, called DEVI MAHATMYAM,
She took the incarnation in nine defferent forms,
namely; 1. Mahishasura Mardhini; 2.Yogindra
(Mahakali); 3. Kausiki (Mahavidya); 4. Sunanda
(Vindhyavasini); 5.Raktadantika; 6. Sakambari; 7.
Durga; 8.Bheema; 9.Bhramari,Swayambhu. During
the time of Manu, She appeared as Mahishasura
Mardhini to destroy Mahishasura and as Yogindra
(Mahakali) to destroy asuras called Madhu kytabhu
and as Kausiki (Mahavidya) to kill asuras called
Shumbha and Nishumbha. She once again killed the
same asuras when She appeared as Sunanda, when
they took birth again with the same names. She killed
some more asuras as Raktadantika, as Her teeth be-
came red with the blood of the asuras when She de-
stroyed. However, She became a symbol of Kindness
and Love and compassion to become Dhanyalakshmi
by giving success to the drought- stricken people.
Sri Dhanyaragni twam devi

In DEVI MAHATMYAM, She describes Herself thus:
Tatoham Akhilam lokam
Atmadeha samudbhavaih12
13
Bharihyami surah sakhaih
Ravrishtaih pranadharakeh
Sakhambhariti vikhyatim
Tada yasyamyaham bhuvi
"I will become known in the world as Sakambari
by people's lives by making the crops and other fruits
grown from Me, during the rainy season". She is also
known as Gowridevi, which Personifies the fully ma-
ture crops yellow colour, tinged with red. She is born
on in Margaseersha Shudha Panchami and this day is
known as Sri Panchami, which is celebrated as a fes-
tival day. When She killed an asura called Durga, She
became 'Durgamatha' and again taking birth as
'Bheema', She destroyed the asuras who were creat-
ing panic in the Himalayas. She destroyed an asura
called Arunudi to become 'Bhramarisakthi' (meaning
She appeared in the form of black bees), She is Sri
Saila Bhramaramba. In Kritayuga, She appeared as
Anaghadevi, the wife of Sri Dattatreya Swami, who
represents the Thrimurthulu. She lived in Kolhapur
by killing an asura called Karaveera. She became Sri
Mahalakshmi to people who worshipped Her. She took
birth in Padmasarovara as Alamelu Manga. She ap-
peared as Bhargavi because of Khyati - the wife of
Bhrigu Maharshi. Durvasa cursed Her to lose Herself
in the sea because She insulted him. However, on Her
prayer to condole Her behaviour, he took pity on Her
and told Her that She would appear during the churn-
ing of the sea (by asuras and suras) and marry Sri
Mahavishnu. Thus, She took birth as Samudrakanya,
Chandrasahodari and Sagara Putri to live as His Con-
sort in Vaikuntham. She gave birth to a son by name
Hayudu, when She was in the form of a Mare and Sri
Mahavishnu was in incarnation of Hayagreeva swami.
She appeared as Sri Vedanarayana as the Royal Con-
sort of Sri Mahavishnu during the time of Sri Maha
Vishnu's Mathsyavatara. During the time of His
Kurmavatara She appeared as Kurmavati, as
Bhumahalakshmi (during His Varahaswami avatara)
as Bhumaha Lakshmi (during His Narasimha avatara)
and as Sri Sitamahalakshmi (during His Ramavatara)
and as Rukmini (during His Krishnavatara). Besides,
She appears as Jaganmatha, Gajalakshmi,
Dhanalakshmi, Dhanyalakshmi, Santhanalakshmi,
Vidyalakshmi, Adilakshmi and as Vijayalakshmi to
fulfil the desires of the devotees.
Dear readers! Now let us know the holiest and
noblest story of Sri Mahalakshmi as Bhumahalakshmi
(as VYUHA LAKSHMI) and as Alamelu manga in
Thiruchanur and about the Glory and Magnificence
of this shrine Tiruchanur in this book, (The sanctorum
of Goddess Padmavathi) SIRI KOLUVU.14

CHAPTER-3
THE MIRACLE OF PADMA SAROVARA
In the ancient holy land of Bharata Khanda, there
were regions, which were famous by the names of
kingdoms called Chappannar. They were 56 countries.
Once upon a time, it was called Kambojadesam, named
after the king Kamboja. But, in course of time, it was
forgotten and nobody now remembers their names. It
was a land of plentiful of nature's gifts. With good
crops, it was also known for excellence in Arts. There
were great warriors and men with valour and women
ready to sacrifice their 'mangalya' for a heroic cause.
With plenty of wealth and splendour each home was
joyful. It was as if Goddess Mahalakshmi was living
amongst them. Every home was a divine place-
Vaikuntham.
At one time, it was ruled by a king called
Sankhana. His valour was matched by his limitless
generosity. With his kind-heartedness, he loved all the
citizens of his country. He had one quality, i.e., he was
amenable to any kind of advice without thinking of
its consequences. As he was kind-hearted, he used to
give away anything without thinking, even for a mo-
ment, whether the person to whom he was giving de-
served it or not. Naturally, because of this quality of
misplaced generosity, he lost everything in his pos-
session, including his kingdom; nobody cared for him.
His sorrowful condition was because of his ill-fated
personality. He was left with poverty. He was made to
leave his kingdom along with wife. Left in distress,
he moved aimlessly like a vagabond. Disgusted with
himself, he used to wonder at his own fate and uttered
the following words to himself: "I was once an Em-
peror, with all the splendor and majesty. Now I am a
destitute. The world, for whom I have given so much
of my wealth and comforts, is now looking down upon
me. We cannot bear with this condition. So, let us end
this life". These words shocked his wife, who was de-
voted to him. She wept bitterly and prayed to God in
these words: "Oh Lord Srimannarayana, if at all, You
exist, spare my husband, protect him". She also swore
by the power of her mangalasutra, like this: "Oh God-
dess of the world! Save my husband and my
mangalya". May be, because of their past, noble deeds,
they saw some holy men, when they were wandering
in their aimless journey. Falling at their feet, they
prayed like this, with these touching words. There was
a deep feeling in what they uttered: "Oh holy saints!
You are our saviours. Only you can save us from our
present sorrowful condition". Then, the holy men in-
tuitively learnt about their past glory and present sor-
row and uttered these words: "All your sorrows are
because of your fate. Nobody can escape the deeds of16
fate. Instead of bemoaning your sorrows, you can re-
deem your fate by taking bath in holy places and vis-
iting temples and worshiping God. Very soon, you will
get your kingdom and all your sorrows will come to
an end". With these words, the holy men went away
after blessing them. In such moments as these, affected
by fate and feeling sad due to the sorrows of life, the
value of meeting noble minds, talking and interacting
with them increase our faith in the goodness in this
world. The pleasures of this 'SATWA' are many; they
lighten our hearts and give us new, enlightened
thoughts and make us search new pastures of hope
and renewal of joy. Visiting holy shrines is also one
such activity to clean our minds of evil thoughts and
deeds. Thus, the erstwhile king and his wife visited
all the holy shrines: In Srirangam, they took a holy
dip in Cauvery, and worshipped at the feet of His Ho-
liness Shri Ranganathaswami and Jambukeswara. In
Madurai, they feasted their eyes by worshiping God-
dess Meenakshi and their devotion knew no bounds
when they visited the holy temples of Rameswaram.
With their minds filled with devotional thoughts, they
also visited Kanchi to worship Varadarajaswami and
Goddess Kamakshi; after visiting all these holy places,
they finally reached the Seven Hills of Lord
Venkateswara. They took a holy dip in Swarnamukhi
River and performed the rituals by mentioning their
17
"Gothra nama" and worshipped Shri Gnana
Prasunamba and Sri Kalahasteeswara. Then, a holy
man came near the resting Sankhana and told him the
following words: "Oh mighty king! There is a Holy
Pond called "Padma Sarovaram", as it is known for
its beautiful Lotus Flowers. This was created on the
prayer of Venkateswara. Goddess Mahalakshmi was
born in these Thousand-Petalled Lotuses. As those
Lotuses are Golden Flowers, they shine in their Re-
splendent Brightness. Hence, the Goddess is known
as Padmavathi and Alamelu Mangamma to all Her
devotees. As this Goddess is known for Her Kindness
and Benevolence, She is worshipped by all the Gods
like Brahma, Sun, Moon and all the Navagrahas. You
must go and take a holy bath in that Holy Pond with a
strong will for the restoration of your kingdom. All
your past sins will be atoned and your life once again
will be happy with a sense of fulfilment". After listen-
ing to the holy words of this wise man, they were over-
whelmed with inexplicable joy and decided to take
bath. After seeing that Holy Pond, near Sri
Kalahasteeswara temple on the northern banks of
Swarnamukhi river, they were delighted. It was filled
with Lotus Flowers and joyfully humming bees. They
enjoyed themselves the pleasure of taking bath in the
holy water, which was also a wonderful spectacle of
many delightful creatures swimming in those waters.18
19
That pond was surrounded by sweet, fragrant flowers
and sweet smelling fruits. It was a wonderful spec-
tacle of delightfully chirping birds. It was a soul fill-
ing experience, with its quiet, fragrant breeze filling
their senses. It was here that Lord Venkateswara spent
His days in worshiping and chanting the name of
Mahalakshmi for Twelve Years. It was Shukla
Panchami in Karthika masa on Friday on Abhijit lagna
and Uttarashada star that Sri Mahalakshmi made Her
Divine Presence as Alamelu Manga in this Holy Pond.
Our past sins will be atoned, if we take a bath in this
Holy Pond! Thus, the royal consorts by enjoying
nature's beauty, which gave delight to their eyes and
divine bliss, took a holy dip in that pond by invoking
the blessings of Almighty God! By pronouncing their
Gothra and nama, they prayed to Sri Mahalakshmi with
reverence and devotion:
Vanda Lakshmeem parasivamayeem

Tejo rupaam kanakavasanaam

"Oh Mother! You are quintessentially present in
all the creatures, Glittering in all brilliance! You are
present adorned in Golden Attire and decorated Your-
self with invaluable ornaments! You are the very Em-
bodiment of Pure Joy and Eternal Beauty! You endow
Yourself with the Holiest of mantras called OMKARA
and seating Yourself ever so majestically on the left
side of Sri Mahavishnu, by having water in the Golden
Kalasa and Golden Lotuses in Your Hands, You Bless
us, the troubled humanity with Karuna! We pray at
Your Holiest Feet! Give us Your darshan to make our
lives worthy!

to bless us with wealth and plenitude! We prostrate
before You! Give us Your darshan to make our lives
holy!

And
Drive away the murky darkness in us! Sanction us all
wealth and prosperity by removing our poverty!
In this manner, the king Sankhana with his royal
consort prayed to Sri Mahalakshmi on the banks of
this Pond with bhakti and in his trance like prayer to
Her Holiness, Alamelu Manga symbolizing Univer-
sal Mother appeared in his vision. Then, he sang in
great ecstasy the following lines:
Jayatu jayatu Lakshmeerlakshanaalankritangi
Jayatu jayatu padma padmasadma bhivandya
Jayatu jayatu vidya vishnu vamanka sanstha
Jayatu jayatu samyak sarva sampatkaree sreeh
-Sri Lakshmi Hridayam (Atharvana Vedam)
"I praise You, Goddess, who is shining with all
the noble qualities and who is praised by no less a
person than the Lord, (who is born in the Lotus) and
living in Splendid Brightness in the Left Hand posi-
tion of Lord Vishnu (who lives in Vaikuntha). All be
well with You, the Giver of all wealth. He praised Her
also in these words: "You are a Goddess praised and
eulogized by all the Gods. You are called Bhadra and22
23
You are the daughter of Goddess Lakshmidevi. You
are called Nithya. You are the Eternal Source of Wis-
dom and Divine Knowledge. You are also called
Sathyadevi, as You are present in all these still and
motionless and yet moving objects".
Jayatu jayatu ramya ratna garbhantarastha!
Jayatu jayatu sudhaa sudha jambunadabha !
Jayatu jayatu kanta ! kantimatbhasutangi !
Jayatu jayatu santa seeghra magacha samye !
-Sri Lakshmi Hridayam (Atharvana Vedam)
As the mighty king lost himself in a trance, fail-
ing to describe Her greatness and majesty any further
in words, he lost himself in silence. In that trance like
condition, he had a vision. In that vision, he had seen
a marvellous spectacle. In that spectacle, he heard the
words of a holy man like this: "Oh! Mighty and noble
king! When you have taken the bath in all the holy
rivers and ponds, all your past sins have been atoned!
Now you are shining with resplendent brightness,
blessed with divine sanction. As you are blessed with
the vision of Her Holiness, you are shining like pure,
molten gold, without impurities. If you come along
with Me, I will take both of you, the royal consorts, to
a place of Great Bliss and Divine Presence". As they
followed with obedience and devotion, the footsteps
of the holy man, they saw a spectacle of rare beauty.
When they asked him, where was he taking them, he
replied that they were going to the Divine Shrine called
Sri Venkatachalam. It is known in many names: In
Krithayuga, it was called Vrishachalam; in Thretayuga,
it was called Anjanachalam; in Dwaparayuga, it was
known as Seshachalam. It was such a Pious and Holy
Mountain that it would remove all our sins. It would
drive all our sins like the dark clouds being driven
away by sun's sharp rays. Even the mere touch of these
Venkatachala Mountains would remove all our sins.
It would also give us wealth, children and health and
intelligence and great strength of mind. Like this, it
would endow us with whatever we pray for! It is a
delightful place with nature in full blossom! Flowers
bloom; lakes, ponds and humming bees and flower
gardens and green trees and fragrant air - all these
nature's bounties make this Venkatachalam a marvel-
ous spectacle of Heaven on earth! With the presence
of rare birds, wild animals and great Rishis in their
meditation in the caves and Yogis-they are all eternal
symbols of God's presence on earth. Also, the bril-
liantly shining precious stones and diamonds make a
feast to our eyes. Once upon a time, the most glitter-
ing mountain called, Meru, went on a penance to please
Lord Brahma. It appealed to Lord Brahma to make it
eternal, shining with precious diamonds and perenni-
ally rich in all nature's bounties. From then onwards,
it has become the Shining Abode of all that is Great24
and Bountiful. It is also known as Sri Venkatachala
Kshetra, where all the Rishis and Gods are in pen-
ance. Also, all good people and noble souls are in pen-
ance. They worship all the natural forces for the wel-
fare of humanity and the universe at large. It was on
this place that noble Rishis like Suka, and Lord Brahma
and others were chanting the Vedas as all the Hills are
reverberating with the Vedic incantations. Some great
men and yogis are dancing in joy along with the pea-
cocks and serving at the Feet of Lord Venkateswara.
The cuckoos and parrots are chanting the Puranas. This
beautiful mountain is shining even more brightly with
the spiritual power of these Rishis. There is also a Holy
Pond called Swami Pushkarini. It was brought to this
world by the Garutmanta as ordained by Lord
Mahavishnu. There are many other ponds and water
falls and sacred places where people take their bath.
They are known as pushkarinis. As there are many
such pushkarinis, that Hill is known as Pushkaradri.
The small rivulets and tanks, filled with Holy water,
to their brim, not only purify the past sins of the devo-
tees but also cure their illnesses. Hence, this place is
known for its beneficial qualities of further enriching
all the joys and happiness of the devotees. Lord Vishnu
made this mountain His Abode along with His Con-
sorts, Sri Mahalakshmi and Bhummhalakshmi for the
sake of His devotees, on the prayer of other Gods and
25
Sage Narada, and all the Rishis. Since then, He has
been present on this Holy Hill along with His Consort
Sri Mahalakshmi and become the only God in the
Kaliyuga.
Emi valasina chichu neppudainanu
Emaraku kolichina nitade daivamu
He is the God sanctioning all our desires and ful-
filling our hopes. Also, Sri Mahalakshmi, with Her
Kind Heart and Benevolent Self prays to Lord Srinivas
to fulfil all our prayers. She also enthuses the Lord to
grant our desires. She is seated on a Lotus in a rect-
angle and is known as VYUHALAKSHMI, as She is
eternally present in Her Lord's bosom. As She appears
hidden in the bosom, we can also see Her in the form
of SWATANTRA VEERALAKSHMI on the banks of
Swarnamukhi river in Sukapura. She is present as
ARCHAMURTHI, the deity worshipped in temples.
"Oh mighty king, Sankhana! As you have taken Holy
bath in the Lotus Pond and worshipped Alamelu
Mangamma as Veera Lakshmi all your past sins have
been atoned. One can worship Swatantra Veera
Lakshmi as all the devotees can worship Her at all
times. But, they cannot worship "VYUHA LAKSHMI"
as She is present in Lord Venkateswara's Bosom. She
listens to the devotees' prayers first and then prays to
Lord Venkateswara for their fulfilment. She is present
as "VYUHA LAKSHMI" in Swami's Bosom. Her26
27
mind is ennobling. Her Kindness is Eternal. She al-
ways gives Her grace to all Her devotees at all times.

She is called VYUHALAKSHMI. She is our
Kamadhenu and Chintamani granting all our prayers.
Her 'Two Hands' are the Kalpavriksha. Her
DIVYASWARUPA - i.e., Her Divine Presence is a
symbol of Infinite Wealth. We are overwhelmed by
Her intimate Kindness, as Her Divine Beauty inspires
many possessed artist! Even by our mere looking at
Her Most Gracious Face removes all our sins; all the
enlightened souls worship VYUHALAKSHMI with
their devout prayers, poems and songs.

She is Ubiquitous in Her Presence, with Her Wis-
dom of the Holiest of Gods, Gayathri; She is the Cre-
ator of the all that is Changing and Eternal. She is the
source of Gnana-and is worshipped by the noble men.
She inspires good thoughts and deeds in us! She Saves
us from our unintended evil deeds. If we worship Her
and Swami by Gayathri Mantra, we will be blessed
with the fulfilment of all our desires by the Gracious
Kindness of Sri Lakshmi Venkata Ramana Swami.

Swami wears Sri Mahalakshmi as Srivatsam in
His bosom. Swami, Lakshmipathi looks after Her with
Infinite Love- He, the source of All Forms of Knowl-
edge and Wealth! They spend all Their time in redeem-
ing the suffering humanity. They are worshipped by
the devotees in the Holiest of Shrines called
Venkatachalam.
In these Holy Mountains, there are Seven Hills
called - Seshadri, Garudadri, Venkatadri, Narayanadri,
Vrishabhadri, Vrishadri and Anjanadri. Hence, this
Shrine is called SAPTHAGIRI. Lord Srinivasa in-
vokes His Divine Blessings, as the Protector of all His
devotees. While saying these words, the noble man28
29
accompanied the king and his royal consort to Swami
Pushkarini and explained the significance of the Holy
Pond in these words:
Swami pushkarini snanam sadguroh
padasevanam
Ekadasi vratam chapi traya matyanta
durlabham
Durlabham manusham janma, durlabham
tatra jeevanam
Swami pushkarini snanam traya matyanta
durlabham
"Performing the holy ritual on Ekadasi, doing ser-
vice to noble souls and taking holy bath in this Swami
Pushkarini - are truly fortunate events in any body's
lives. You are blessed with all these three events. To-
day is Ekadasi. You can accept Me as your path- finder.
After performing your Sankalpa, you can take a holy
dip in this Pushkarini. Taking Me as your instructor
and path-finder, now you can visit the temple of Lord
Srinivasa". After they took a bath in Pushkarini, He
took them to the temple of Advaraha swami and after
asking them to next visit the temple of the Lord, who
was
possessing
Alamelu
Manga
as
VYUHALAKSHMI in His bosom, the noble man dis-
appeared. Spell bound with these miracles and won-
ders of Nature, the royal consorts, attended the temples
of Lord Srinivasa. They were wondering whether it
was a dream or mere illusion, as they continued their
journey to Sapthagiri Hills. After paying respects to
the Lotus Pond, they climbed Mountains with deep
devotion and were enamoured by Nature's beauties.
They spent all their time in praying Lord Srinivasa.
King Sankhana’s mind and thoughts were filled with
devotion to Him. He was chanting the names of
'Srinivasa' and 'Govinda'. With deep love, he uttered
these words; "Oh God! give me Your darshan! I have
no hunger or thirst, as I am praying to You. All my
thoughts and feelings and mind are filled only with
You. Oh! Goddess, Alamelu Mangamma! on our be-
half ask Your Lord to show His Benediction and Infi-
nite Kindness to us!" Praying like this, they spent six
months in great joy and with a sense of fulfilment.
One day he was praying like this with folded hands;
Sri Venkatesam ! Lakshmisam ! anishtaghna
mabheeshtadam
Chaturmakhera tanayam srinivasambhajenisam
"Oh Lord Venkateswara! You are the Lord of All
Mountains! You are our Benefactor! You are the
Source of all that is Beautiful and Eternal. We always
pray to you!" As they were praying in this manner, an
appearance was shining in a glittering manner.30

It came out of the Holy Pushkarini. It was like a
Resplendent White Mighty Cloud. It was marvellous
to see such a spectacle! It was also bedecked with many
rare and precious stones. It was the Abode of Lord
Srimannarayana. In it, they saw Srimannarayana along
with Bhu-Neeladevi in Their Splendid Appearance.
They were decorated with many jewels of scintillat-
ing beauty, and fragrant flowers. As they made Their
Appearance, all the Gods showered flowers, chanting
their Names. The royal consorts saw the divine spec-
tacle as they were fortunate. Lord Srinivasa blessed
the royal couple in the following words; "Oh mighty
king! I have appeared before you to tell you that all
your past sins have been atoned. You have visited Me
and Sri Mahalakshmi who is in My Bosom. Now you
are pure. You are shining like molten gold. You will
get your kingdom back soon. You will enjoy all your
past comforts, pomp and glory". After that, Sankhana
regained his kingdom by defeating all his enemies and
attained Moksha after leading a happy life. He
achieved Kaivalya (Supreme end). By reading this
story, we come to know that, by making a trip to
Tirumala to seek the Blessings of Lord Srinivasa, all
our sins and sorrows would disappear. This should
enthuse all the devotees to pray to Him for His Bless-
ings.
Earlier, Tiruchanur was known as
Adivarahakshetramu. Now we should know about this
Adivarahakshetramu. It was created as
Adivarahakshetramu, long before it came to be known
as Sri Venkatachala Kshetram. It was called
Adivarahakshetram as Sri Mahavishnu Appeared as
White Pig in One of His "Avataras". Since Bhudevi
sat on His left thigh it came to be known as Bhuvaraha
Kshetramu. There are Two Goddesses besides Him in
Vaikuntham. They are, Sri Mahalakshmi and Bhu
Mahalakshmi. The two Goddesses, namely Sri
Mahalakshmi and Bhu Mahalakshmi were responsible
for the incarnation of Padmavathi. Vedavati in kaliyuga
appeared with the spirit of Bhudevi of Tretayuga and
with the spirit of Sri Mahalakshmi She appeared as
Padmavathi in the Golden Lotus Pond. In any case, in
one word, whether it is Sri Varahakshetra or
Venkatachala or Sri Padmasarovara-all these are the
incarnations of Bhu Mahalakshmi and Sri
Mahalaskshmi.
These are not fortuitous events: without the de-
termination of Bhu Mahalakshmi, the incarnation of
Varaha Swami - would not have been there; had Sri32
33
Mahalakshmi left Vaikuntha, there would not have
been the incarnation of Sri Venkateswara nor the ex-
istence of Holy Venkatachala Kshetra. In a similar way,
neither Kolhapur nor Tiruchanur would have existed.
Thus, the Two Wives of Srimannarayana were the
Divinely Given incarnations. Whether, we call Them
Harikoluvu or Venkatachala or Sirikoluvu (which be-
came Tiruchanur) - These Shrines are Blessed Shrines
for human liberation (moksha).
Sri Lakshmi Venkataramana Govinda !
Govinda !! Govinda !!!
CHAPTER-4
PARANDHAMA IN SRI VAIKUNTHA
It is known as Sri Vaikuntha. There, Sri
Mahalakshmi is resting on the thousand-headed
Adiseshu. Sri Mahavishnu is resting in the Milky Sea,
where waves are tossing. Adiseshu has a forked
tongue, from which poisonous flames emerge. The eye
balls of him are frightening. In any case, Sri
Mahavishnu is resting peacefully there. He is resting
in quiet composure, leaning on His Right Hand;
Srilakshmi and Bhulakshmi are pressing His Tender
Feet, with great care and love, while, He is in great
comfort. Even as He appears looking outwards, He
looks inward, indicating that "He is present Every
where". He looks after the mutable and immutable
things. Nothing Hinders Him from His vision. He ap-
pears to be disinterested but He knows all and sees
all. All the devotees look at Him with great devotion
and become spellbound. His Brightness and Radiance
are Glittering! They are insatiated by His Beauty. Their
eyes are dazzled by the radiance of His Beauty, as they
crave for looking at His Beauty. Everybody wonders
at the reason for His Radiance. They think that it is
due to the magnificent presence of Sri Mahalakshmi
and Bhulakshmi. All the devotees are spellbound look-
ing at His Beautiful Face of Transcendental Beauty.
On one side, He is surrounded by Rishis and Yogis
and Gods. Not only Gods, there are yakshas,
gandharvas and kinneras and kimpurushas. They are
also praying to Him in devotion. On the other side,
Narada, the Devarshi is playing with delight veena to
praise His Qualities. They are all in a joyful mood. All
the devotees are hoping that their song is heard by
Him.
Everybody imagines that Sri Hari is listening to
his song or answering his prayers or blessing him with
His Benign Kindness. Swami is listening to every one's
prayer and making everybody happy with His Divine
Presence. However, His imagination and thinking is
concentrated on the Lotus Flower, emanating from His
navel. On that Lotus, Lord Brahma is present. As He34
symbolizes all that is eternal, all the creation is present
in His Mind.
Sri Vishnu saw Lord Brahma, who spoke thus in
humility and obedience: "Oh Our Lord and Father!
We are ready to follow Your command!" and saying
this, he Kneeled before Lord Vishnu, who spoke thus:
"Oh my dear sir! I am granting the strength and ca-
pacity to You to create all this world and nature. You
have to carry out this duty with devotion as a holy
purpose, without being lax and I will protect all the
creation You have thus carried out". Having spoken
thus to Lord Brahma He addressed all the others, stand-
ing before Him: "All those standing before Me, yaksha,
gandharva and kinnera and kimpurusha and all the
Rishis of great penance- all of you should carry out
your appointed duties with devotion and dignity. All
of you must feel that every duty is a Holy duty and
you are the protectors of Dharma. In your rule, all the
people must live in peace and comfort. Narada is also
playing the veena, called "Mahati" and looking at Lord.
Vishnu continued with His journey in all the Three
Worlds (THRI LOKAS).
In this manner, while Brahma was continuing with
this creation, the timeless eternity continued uninter-
ruptedly. Time is eternal and endless. It never stops
for anybody. It is God's incarnation. Brahma created a
wonderful spectacle of Nature. There was Nature's
35
plentitude with wonderful flowers and fruits and birds
singing melodious songs. Brahma also created Man
with Gnana and with this gnana he developed
BHAKTI to attain MOKSHA; even the Gods are jeal-
ous of human beings. Lord Brahma created the hu-
man world with great care and rare interest. Many
Rishis and devoted yogis were doing penance for the
welfare of humanity. Like that, the creation of Brhama
continued ceaselessly for many years. However, in this
quiet, peaceful world, the Rishis had vision of disso-
nance and unquiet and many inglorious scenes. There
were many sorrows, famines and earth quakes and
deluge and fearful diseases which struck the world. In
addition to that, there was the fear of asuras: that is
bad people. All the humanity was struck with fear and
utter helplessness. Then all the Rishis went to Brahma
to seek his help and benevolence to redeem humanity
from those sufferings. They were thinking how to pro-
tect humanity from all those dangers and make them
realize MOKSHA. Brahma, realizing the grim situa-
tion, took them to Lord Siva, who told them that Lord
Vishnu could redeem the suffering humanity. He took
them to Lord Vishnu. They prayed to Him like this:
"Oh great Lord! all the Gods and Rishis are praying
to You, only You are capable of helping the human-
ity". To this, Vishnu in His quiet, dignified manner
assured all the Rishis and Gods with these words: "You
have visited Me and sought My blessings. Now, you36
37
need not worry. I will remove all the evils and fears in
the world. In future, all the weak people and sick
people cannot have moksha. They cannot go to heaven.
There will be many horrors and difficulties. The only
answer is that I should make an Avatara in the world.
I must be present in the world till the end of Kaliyuga.
For this, Sri Mahalakshmi and Bhu Mahalakshmi have
to play a very important role. In the past also, they
played a pivotal role for Loka Kalyana. In any case,
without them, My presence in Kaliyuga will become
futile. As always, in All My Incarnations, in this
Avatara also, Srilakshmi and Bhulakshmi will play a
prominent role. Their role is of great significance. The
great sage of Gods Narada also will be of help in this
Loka Kalyana.
CHAPTER-5
VISIT OF FOUR GREAT RISHIS TO SREE
VAIKUNTHA
In the past, there were four famous Rishis called
Sanakasa, Nandana, Sanatkumara and Sanatsujathulu.
As they were born with the will and desire of Lord
Brahma, they were blessed with great spiritual wis-
dom. They were thus known as the Brahma-
manasaputra implying that they were born with the
divine wisdom and closest to the heart of Lord Brahma.
Though they were of the size of a thumb, they could
go anywhere at all times with their infinite spiritual
wisdom. As they were moving to all the places, send-
ing their rays of wisdom, they entered Vaikuntha to
seek the Blessings of Sri Vishnu, who is the Lord of
All. Then an unfortunate event took place.
As they were reaching Vaikuntha, they were
stopped at the entrance by Jaya and Vijaya. They told
those four wise men that His Lordship Sri Mahavishnu
was in Ekantha and nobody was allowed to go inside.
Now, we must realize that, in some moments, even
the most peaceful souls also would get perturbed even
for trivial things and behave in an angry manner! Same
thing happened here also. On being told that they
would not be allowed into Vaikuntha, the four ‘Rishis’
cursed the helpless servants of Sri Vishnu, called Jaya
and Vijaya, who were amazed and struck with great
fear. As it created some panic, Sri Mahavishnu rushed
out of His Ekantha and understood the seriousness, of
the problem. However, He appeared calm and quiet.
For, He is above all these disturbances! He gave
Darshan to the four 'Rishis' to their heart's content.
Struck with fear and filled with despair, Jaya and
Vijaya prayed to Him for His Benediction to come
out of the curse, pronounced by the four 'Rishis'. How-
ever, knowing as He does, all the causes for all ac-
tions, only advised them to be born as Rakshasas in
their next three births, and worship Him with hatred38
39
and enemity. Thus, another Avatara of His took place.
All the Gods were happy. Sage Narada proclaimed
thus: "a new Avatara of Him will take place." After
that incident, solemn quietness ruled Vaikuntha as
ever!
CHAPTER-6
COMING OF BHULAKSHMI ON TO THE
EARTH
Sri Mahavishnu was in a mood of contemplation,
thinking about that event. Bhu Mahalakshmi and Sri
Mahalakshmi asked Him like this: "Oh Our Lord! Tell
us what You are thinking". Then He told about the
incident, in which Jaya and Vijaya were cursed by the
four 'Rishis'. First He told Bhu Mahalakshmi like this:
"Bhudevi! These are My words. Follow them. You
must enter Earth as a symbol of plentitude of wealth,
joy and pleasure for everybody. All the parts of The
Earth will be resplendent with brightness and every
moment of it will be filled with spiritual wisdom. Your
spiritual presence and divine beauty encompasses the
whole world, you will be known as Sri Bhu
Mahalakshmi. By Your presence, a Holy Shrine will
be established through which all the people will seek
redemption (MOKSHA). Hence, I advise You to im-
mediately go there. You will become responsible for
My "Avatara". To these words of Her Lord, Sri Bhu
Mahalakshmi spoke like this: "Oh Lord! Whatever You
pronounce, I shall oblige. Your Utterance to us is as
Holy as the Vedas". Then, Sri Mahalakshmi wondered,
what She should do. To this, Sri Mahavishnu consoled
Her with these words: "As Sri Bhulakshmi is becom-
ing responsible for Loka Kalyana,You will also ap-
pear in Another incarnation to Me. Believe Me, that
will not be incarnation, but We will Appear as We are
in Two different places on Earth and offer Our
'Darshan' to Our devotees. You have to wait as the
time has not come for it".
CHAPTER-7
BHU MAHALAKSHMI-ADI VARAHASWAMI
As promised by Lord Vishnu, He appeared in the
incarnation of Adivaraha swami. For that, as pro-
claimed by Him, Bhulakshmi appeared first in the Adi
Varaha Kshetra. The story is like this: As Time passed
in eons, Lord Brahma continued ceaselessly this cre-
ation, in all its splendor and magnificence. However,
after performing the act of creation uninterruptedly,
He felt a bit tired and naped into sleep. Then, all his
creation came to a sudden halt, resulting in chaos. The
Sun and Moon lost their directions. There was deluge
as all the Universe was filled with endless rain. Sanaka
and Sananda (who were cursed to lead the lives of
ASURAS), were destroying the Universe in the guise40
of Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakasipa. They were caus-
ing a lot of misery to the 'Rishis' by destroying their
holy places of Yagna and Tapa. In the temples, they
obstructed people from performing their worship.
Hiranyaksha making the whole Universe into a ball
was playing with it. He created great havoc in nature
and all humanity was terminated by his evil deeds.
Bhudevi was anguished by his evil deeds and prayed
to Sri Mahalakshmi with folded hands to save the tor-
mented humanity, who prayed to Him. As His creation
was suffering, Brahma woke up to realize the suffer-
ing in the world. He too, prayed to Sri Mahavishnu to
redeem the suffering humanity. Then, Sri Mahavishnu,
who is known for His infinite Kindness to His ‘bhaktas’
felt the deep pangs of suffering and became angry to
take the form of the fearful Avatara called Swetha
Varaha. How does this Avatara look like? It has very
sharp and curved, White teeth. It makes a thunderous
roar, shaking all the Universe. It has the form of an
Giant sized animal. With this form Sri Mahavishnu,
Shining in Resplendent whiteness of Varahavatara, en-
tered here through the torrential floods. As He was
rescuing the Universe by the use of His Teeth,
Hiranyaksha stopped Him. After fighting a fearful
battle with him, Sri Mahavishnu in Varahavatara de-
stroyed him. He also retrieved him by the forces of
His Teeth and saved the humanity. Gods praised His
41
Heroic deeds. They eulogized Him in many words and
in many ways. Even as the yakshas and kimpurushas
sang His praise, His anger did not become lessened.
As the whole Universe was spinning on His Teeth,
Bhudevi was deeply moved by that touch, and She
prayed to Him in these words: "Oh! Lord Varahadeva!
You have saved all of us from the treachery of
Hiranyaksha, all of us are happy for this! His torture
destroyed Me for a number of years. I suffered much
anguish in his hands. I am happy now to see You. You
are now in the incarnation of Varaha! You are Appear-
ing in this beautiful form as Varaharupa. I am greatly
delighted by Your Appearance! Hence, I pray to You
to accept Me as Your Consort". To these words, Sri
Adivaraha replied in All Kindness and Benevolence,
thus: "I want to tell you, Oh Goddess Bhulakshmi! I
took up this form only to save You from the clutches
of Hiranyaksha. I also created Loka Kalyana! I have
taken up this form only for Your sake. Now I will ac-
cept You as My Consort. I will stay here along with
You on this Earth and become known to everybody as
Bhuvarahaswami and this Holy Shrine would be
known as Bhuvarahakshetra, Adivarahakshetra and
Swethavarahakshetra. Also, this kshetra will become
important for Another Avatara of Mine!" Sri
Mahavishnu turned towards Garutmanta, who was
standing before Him in obedience and told him like42
this: Oh ! Mighty king of the world! You have been
devotedly serving in All My Avataras! In This Avatara,
I have saved Bhulakshmi as This Avatara is meant for
Her only. As I wish to stay here along with Her. I want
you to go to Vaikuntham immediately and tell Sri
Mahalakshmi about My Desire and bring Her here".
After this, Garutmanta, the mighty bird, known for
his prowess, narrated all these events to Sri
Mahalakshmi. After listening to the words of Sri
Mahavishnu, through Garutmanta, Sri Mahalakshmi
left Vaikuntham, after leaving behind Her Original
Spirit. She, thus, reached the Earth. Garutmanta es-
tablished the Mountain on which he brought Sri
Mahalakshmi on to the Holy Place on the northern
side of the bank of Swarnamukhi river, as desired by
Sri Mahavishnu. Then, Sri Mahavishnu sat on the
Splendid White Teeth, along with Bhu Mahalakshmi.
All the Gods, yakshas and kinneras, Rishis and yogis
came there. All of them eulogized the Splendid Beauty
of Sri Mahavishnu on whose Teeth the Earth was shin-
ing all too brilliantly. They all sang in praise of Him
in these words for destroying Hiranyaksha and rescu-
ing Bhudevi- "Oh Swethavarahaswami! Thousand
salutations to You! Hari! Your noble deeds are mar-
velous! Your deeds in destroying Hiranyaksha deserve
all praise! Your Appearance in Swethavaraha is, in-
deed, Beautiful. You have destroyed Hiranyaksha! So,
43
what is the need for Your Appearance as Swethavaraha
any longer! We pray You to give up that Form. For, in
This Form, You Appear frightening! All the Gods,
Rishis and Munis are afraid of seeing You! Oh Sri
Hari! now You can have peace in Your mind! You can
Appear Beautiful and Peaceful in Your Original Form".
Then they also prayed to Sri Bhu Mahalakshmi, who
was present on the Shining Teeth like this: "Oh Mother
of all of us! Only because of Your Kindness Sri
Mahavishnu has taken up This Avatara! This is an
Unique Avatara. Oh Vasundhara! You are the Embodi-
ment of All Wealth. You and Sri Mahalakshmi are in-
separable! You may look different physically but You
are the one and the same in mind and spirit. Oh
Hiranmayee! Bless us with Your Kindness. The Earth
is full of treasures and crops. "Oh Mother of the world!
Grant us the pleasure of seeing You! We are very happy
to see You along with Srihari in His Avatara as
Adivaraha!"

Filled with happiness, with the words of all the
Rishis and Gods, Sri Mahalakshmi spoke to them like
this:" Oh Gods! I have Appeared in This Avatara to
destroy Hiranyaksha. Bhulakshmi is responsible for
This Avatara! I will stay here along with Sri44
Bhulakshmi to give Darshan to you all! I agree to give
Darshan to you as Sri Bhuvarahaswami and Sri
Adivarahaswami and Sri Swethavarahaswami. From
now onwards, This Shrine will be known as
Bhuvarahakshetram,
Adivarahakshetram,
Swethavarahakshetram". With these words,
Varahaswami Appeared in a Pleasant Form, without
the anger. Sri Bhu Mahalakshmi, who was present on
the Teeth of Sri Varahaswami also became Kind and
Appeared in Her Benign Mood. She sat on the left
thigh of Sri Vishnu by giving Her Blessings to all Her
devotees. All the Gods showered fragrant flowers and
played soulful music on seeing that marvellous sight.
All the devotees sang melodiously of the Greatness
and Bliss of Sri Vishnu and Bhu Mahalakshmi, Who
showered Their Blessings on them. All the devotees
left for their places after getting their desires fulfilled.
Then, Sri Vishnu spoke thus to Sri Mahalakshmi,
whom Garutmanta brought from Vaikuntham: "Sri
Mahalakshmi, as You have also come Here, We are
happy. Initially, I thought that You would show dis-
gust by looking at My Form as Adivaraha. Therefore,
I did not invite You to come Here". To these words,
Sri Mahalakshmi replied thus: "Oh Lord! I am with
You in whatever form You are and wherever You are.
I cannot be separated from You even for a moment.
Therefore, I have joyfully come Here to be with You
to work for Loka Kalyana. Hence, I request You to
45
accept Me along with Sri Bhulakshmi". Sri Vishnu,
who knows everything, assured Her in these words:
"Oh My Dear Consort! Adilakshmi, I will stay Here
for some more time on This Earth. So, You can also
stay along with Me", and embraced Her to make Her
live in His Bosom as "VYUHALAKSHMI". From then
onwards, Sri Bhulakshmi was present on His left thigh;
and He used to give His Darshan to His devotees in
His Magnificent Form. Thus, Sri Adivarahakshetram
came into existence due to Sri Bhulakshmi. Like that,
many eons have gone by. Thus, Sri
Venkateswaraswami Appeared in Varahakshetram as
it was the place where Sri Mahalakshmi came from
Vaikuntham to live there. Now, we should know the
pious story of how Sri Venkateswaraswami Appeared
in Sri Varahakshetram.
CHAPTER-8
MAHALAKSHMI IN SRI VAIKUNTHAM
It was a marvelous day of great joy and felicity.
Sri Lakshminarayana and His Consort were indulg-
ing Themselves in a Playful Mood. As They were thus
regaling Themselves in Great Delight, there was a ter-
rible noise, indicating destruction. As Sri Mahalakshmi
became frightened of it, She asked Him "what were
those cries of despair born of deep sorrow and agony?"
She was frightened by those voices. However, He, ever46
quiet and knowledgeable, told Her that they were the
voices of the despairing and despondent souls. We hear
their despairing voices even in Vaikuntham. They rep-
resent the coming days of disorder and utter chaos in
the Kaliyuga. When His Consort wanted to know the
answer to those problems, He replied thus: "There is
only one answer, We should take a New Avatara in
Kaliyuga. We should Appear as We are in
Vaikuntham". To these words, She immediately agreed
to follow Him wherever He goes, in Obedience and
out of Love to Him. However, He advised Her to first
visit the Earth and He would follow Her. As She was
surprised, He explained to Her that in Kaliyuga, there
are many people with sin and evil in their minds. There-
fore, They should see that the real devotees are not
affected by these evil-minded people. He also told Her
that She has a very important function to perform for
the Loka Kalyana. By Her Divine Acts, Kaliyuga will
become Holy and Happy, like Vaikuntham. Thus, He
asked Her to leave for the Earth. She immediately
started off on that journey. She had a doubt, that is
born out of Her abiding love for Sri Vishnu. She told
Him in despair that as She could not live separated
from Him for long. He should come to the Earth to
live with Her. However, He consoled Her by remind-
ing Her of Her responsibility. He told Her that for Loka
Kalyana, They should be separated. Without Her, He
47
would be incomplete. Thus, as He made Her to get
ready and as They were talking to Each Other, They
were disturbed by the arrival of Bhrigu Maharshi, who
was in an angry mood.
CHAPTER-9
ADILAKSHMI IN A MOOD OF HUFF
This is the story of how Sri Mahalakshmi left
Vaikuntham in a huff. Bhrigu Maharshi reached
Vaikuntham after testing Brahma in His Satyaloka and
Shiva in Kailasa. As he was already filled with de-
spair and sadness, he faced disappointment in
Vaikuntham. He dashed into the sacred place where
Sri Vishnu and Sri Lakshmi were in a state of Happi-
ness. At that time, Adiseshu in his ‘Ksheera Samudra’
(Sea of Milk) was protecting Sri Vishnu like an um-
brella, and making his body as the comfortable place
for Sri Lakshmi serving Him in Great Joy. It was a
Beautiful Sight beyond words. Sri Mahavishnu was
lying in a Blissfully Happy Mood. Sri Mahalakshmi
was leaning Her Head against His Chest. It was a won-
derful sight to see how Sri Mahavishnu and Sri
Lakshmi were in a Happy State. It was as if They were
exchanging Pleasantaries through their eyes. It was a
Marvelous moment of Divine Joy, when Bhrigu
Maharshi barged into Their privacy though chanting48
the Divine Names of Sri Lakshminadha and Sri
Mahalakshmi. They appeared to be inattentive to his
chantings. Sri Adivishnu brought Her even closer to
Him. But, Bhrigu Maharshi was in an angry mood hav-
ing been displeased in Satyaloka of Brahma and
Kailasa of Shiva. As he felt that the same kind of dis-
regard was shown to him, he became restive and lost
his discretion and in a fit of terrible anger, tried to hit
on Swami's Chest with his foot. It was a terrible event.
Sri Mahalakshmi was shocked beyond words. She ran
helter skelter as Bhrigu's foot touched Swami's Chest
forcefully. As He was nonplussed by that incident, He
saluted Bhrigu Maharshi respectfully and told him that
it was His mistake to have not seen and to have not
received him properly. He made him sit comfortably
on the Adiseshu and did a very good thing! While ap-
pearing to press His feet howsoever gently, He crushed
the "eye" Which was representing Bhrigu's ego. This
made Bhrigu confess his bad behaviour and prayed to
Him to exonerate him. Thus, He left Vaikuntham after
chanting His name many a times. Sri Mahalakshmi
was surprised. She thought that Sri Vishnu, instead of
punishing him, was doing service to him. She thought
that he touched the Holy Place in His bosom where
She dwells. She became angry and both Sri Vishnu
and Mahalakshmi became unhappy with that incident.

CHAPTER -10
SIRULA THALLI'S ARRIVAL ON TO THE
EARTH
After thus feeling hurt, She left the Heavenly Place
of Vaikuntham and Sri Vishnu Too and reached the
Ashram of Kapilamuni, in Pathala. As a result of this
sorrowful event, Sri Mahalakshmi was leading a lonely
life, in a secluded manner. Without Sri Mahalakshmi,
Vaikuntham became a lifeless place without joy. His
mind was filled with despair and loneliness. As there
is a feeling of dejection, He went in search of Her. He
started His journey with great determination. He cried
in great agony and despair. He went on searching,
though in vain. He thought that it was futile to return
to Vaikuntham without Her. After going to many places
He finally reached Venkatachalam, which is known
as Bhuvarahakshetra. When Sri Mahalakshmi reached
Kapilamuni's Ashram She was received with Bhakti.
Kapilamahamuni gave Her solace after listening to Her
Hurt Feelings. He advised Her to stay there as long as
She intended. She could spend Her life there in Pen-
ance and Prayer. Thus, Sri Mahalakshmi spent Her
time in quiet Meditation and Penance, without draw-
ing anybody's attention. Agasthya and other Rishis
went to Kapila's Ashram in the underworld
(pathalaloka) and prayed to Sri Mahalakshmi in these
words: "Oh Mother of the World! We pray to You to50
make Your Presence in Karavirapuram, which is also
famously known as Shivalaya, Padmavathipuram and
Dakshinakasi and shower Your Blessings on Your-
devotees. This Kshetra has Greater Value than Kasi.
For in this Place, not only do we get Moksha but our
desires also get fulfilled. Here, along with Lord Shiva,
other Gods are also present. It is also believed that
Lord Vishnu told that there, in Karavirapuram, has
more significance than Kasi. Not only this, in the
Yagna performed by Daksha, the eyes of Sathidevi
have fallen on This Holy Place". Accepting their
prayers, Sri Mahalakshmi appeared only in some forms
of ARCHA RUPAM in Karivirapuram.
In the ancient days, Lord Brahma created three
children in His image, but unfortunately, all of them
turned out to be asuras, known as Gayudu, Lavanudu
and Kolanudu, and of these, Lord Vishnu destroyed
Gayasura and Lavanasura. Only Kolanudu remained.
Kolanudu means, a person who kills pigs; he devel-
oped enemity towards Lord Vishnu and other Gods.
As he did not find any means of showing his enemity
towards Gods, he decided to show it for the Gods
through the means of Penance. Thus, he went on pen-
ance by handing the reins of power of
Padmavathapuram to his sons and after a few days,
an asura by name sukesi destroyed kolanudu's hun-
dred children and occupied their kingdom. Sukesi be-
51
came a remorseless king destroying all civilized and
moral practices causing great suffering to all the Gods.
Then, Gods approached Kolanudu and prayed to him
to rescue them. Kolanadu, accordingly, killed Sukesi
and got back his kingdom; but his enemity against the
Gods did not mitigate. Thereafter, he declared war
against the Gods, whom he could not defeat. He did
not understand why he was failing in his war against
the Gods. Finally, he realized that it was because of
the Grace of Sri Mahalakshmi (who came from
Vaikuntham) for the Gods that hence, he is unable to
destroy them. After thinking deeply, he decided that
he should somehow see that the Gods were not pro-
tected by Mahalakshmi. For that, he decided that pen-
ance was the only way out. Leaving his kingdom in
the care and custody of his son, Karavira (along with
the support of his three sons), he went on Penance to
win the Grace of Sri Mahalakshmi, who, pleased with
his Penance, granted him a Boon. He prayed to Her
like this: "Oh Jaganmatha, Goddess of the world! I
pray to You to leave this Padmavatapuram and go
somewhere else! I request You not to enter this king-
dom once again". Accepting his prayers, She left
Kolhasura's kingdom. He had four sons (who were
given to him by the Grace of Lord Brahma), called
Karavira, Visalasura, Kalandhaka and Lajjasura. He
went on penance by keeping the kingdom in the hands52
of Karavira, being forced by his wife Kadamba. His
remaining three sons would help Karavira. Unfortu-
nately, Karavira was more cruel than Sukesi. He tor-
mented Gods and Rishis and destroyed all the human
beings. As a result, man's faith in Gods was lost. Lord
Siva waged a war against Karavira and his three broth-
ers. Karavira, however, before his death, prayed to
Lord Siva to name his kingdom as Karavirapuram, to
which Siva agreed. From then onwards, the kingdom
was known as Karavirapuram. Becoming angry with
the Gods for killing his sons, kolhasura set out to de-
stroy all of Them. When They prayed to Sri
Mahalakshmi to kill him, She told Them that he would
be invisible for hundred years. From then onwards,
Kolhasura went on perpetuating his cruel deeds and
after the completion of hundred years, Sri Maha
Lakhmi, Katyayani, Thryambuli, Kedareswar and
other Gods attacked Karavirapuram and finally in that
war, Kolhasura realized that his death was nearing and
thus prayed Lakshmidevi, in these words: "Oh Mother
of the world! (Jagajjanani), I pray to You to name this
kshetra as Kolhapura; not only this, I pray to You to
Stay Here and Grant the Desires of the devotees". Thus,
from then onwards, Kolhapur became popular as a
Sadhana Kshetra (Field of accomplishment) and
Siddha Kshetra (Field of attained). All the Gods
chanted the name of Sri Mahalakshmi. Viswakarma
53
built a Beautiful Temple, with Wonderful Sculpture
for the sake of Sri Mahalakshmi. In this Temple, there
are sixteen compounds, made up of iron, brass, cop-
per, silver and gold. In the centre of this temple, he
built Chintamani griha, which is impregnated with
nine precious diamonds (nava rathnalu). Goddess Sri
Mahalakshmi Benevolent and Gracious, discarding
Her earlier posture of ferocity. She was Glittering in
Her Grace, and made Holier by chanting the Vedic
Mantras. She was Present in Chintamanigriha, being
seated as Simha Vahini(name of a raga in Karnataka
music). All the Gods lived there with devotion and
established Holy shrines by their names. Sri
Mahalakshmi- is Present there with Four Hands, as
She destroyed the ferocious Kolhasura with Her Sev-
enteen Hands. She has Gada (Mace) and Dhalu (shield)
in Her Two Hands and Mathangaphala and panapatra
in Her Lower Two Hands. We find Her sitting on Simha
Vahana (Lion's Abode) and present as Sthanakamurthy
(Image of a God presiding over a place, that is a local
deity). She is sitting facing westwards, shining in Her
Grace and Brightness.
In the meanwhile, Sri Mahavishnu after being
Deserted by His Consort, Sri Mahalakshmi, underwent
many difficulties. Suffering from Thirst and Hunger,
He went round in Desperation and Finally reached a
Tamarind Tree near the Pushkarini in Venkatachala54
Kshetra. He took Shelter in a Hole in the Trunk of that
tree. What a pity? Even the Lord Felt Desolated in the
Absence of His Consort. Lord Brahma and Siva went
and told Sri Mahalakshmi of the Sorrowful Condition
of Sri Mahvishnu. However, She did not Relent. But,
out of Pity to Him, She agreed to Remove His Hunger
and Thirst by becoming Gopalika. While Brahma be-
came the Cow, Siva became the Calf; Lakshmidevi as
Gopalika handed Them over to the Chola King. Thus,
while as the cows went in a herd, the New Cow and
Calf secretly Went and Gave Milk to Srinivasa, who
was hiding Himself in a small mound. Srinivasa used
to Drink that Milk with Great Satisfaction. As this Cow
was Giving Milk to Srinivasa, it did not give Milk at
home. So, naturally, as all the people became curious,
the King sent his messengers to find out the secret.
Next day, the messengers finding that the New Cow
was pouring Milk onto the Mound, hit the mound with
their axe, which injured Srinivasa, Who was in that
Mound. As He was injured, blood started blurting out
from His Forehead. Seeing this, the messenger died
on the spot. On knowing that incident, the king reached
that spot hurriedly, and prayed to Srinivasa to pardon
his sin. Then, Srinivasa cursed him to become a de-
mon. However, He took pity on him and the King
Akasaraju performed marriage of his daughter
55
Padmavathi with Him. He gave a Golden Crown as a
gift to Akasaraju. When he wears that crown, his sin
would be atoned. Afterwards, He gave a Boon to the
shepherds that they would be the first persons to see
Him Every Morning. Afterwards, Srinivasa visited
Varahaswami and told him about His story and prayed
for One Hundred Feet of Land for Him to Live in
Kaliyuga. Srinivasa, wanted that all the pilgrims, who
come to see Him, must first visit Varahaswami and
give their offerings. After listening to the sad tale of
Srinivasa, Varahaswami asked Vakulamatha to offer
Her services to Him.
CHAPTER-11
VEDALAKSHMI
One day, Lord Srinivasa was Hunting on the Seven
Hills. At the same time, Padmavathi, the daughter of
Akasaraju, was present in the garden, enjoying Her-
self its beauty. Immediately after seeing Each Other,
They were attracted, as if Their Relationship was Eter-
nal. But, Lord Srinivasa was hurt when Her compan-
ion threw stones. As blood was bleeding from His
Forehead, Vakulamatha was deeply anguished. When
She asked Him if Their relationship would fructify at
all, He revealed the secret of Her Birth.56
57
CHAPTER-12
VEDALAKSHMI AS PADMAVATHI
Lord Srinivasa revealed to Vakuladevi the secret
of Vedavati's birth in the following manner: "This
Padmavathi is none other than Vedavati, who went in
search of Sita in Lanka in Tretayuga. She came to This
Earth only to Marry Me, as part of a Divine Presence
of Vedalakshmi. In the past, there was a Holy Brah-
min called Mayudu, who was chanting the Vedas ev-
ery day. While he was chanting the Vedas, he saw
Urvasi and fell under her spell and this led to their
giving birth to Lakshmi Devi. Since Lakshmi Devi
was born while he was chanting the Vedas, he called
Her Vedavati and looked after Her. As She grew up,
he undertook Penance in a forest called
Niranjanaranya, to marry Me. But, when Ravana
forced her, She Burnt Herself in the Holy fire and
cursed him that he would be killed by Lord Vishnu.
Thus, Vedavati, after being burnt by the holy fires,
reached the God of fire who sent Her (instead of Sita)
to Lanka. After the extinction of fire, when Sita asked
Him to marry Vedavati, He told Her that He would
marry Her (as Padmavathi) only in Kaliyuga, after
coming to Earth as Lord Venkateswara. Thus, Vedavati,
who is a part of Sri Mahalakshmi, was born as a daugh-
ter to Akasaraju in the Golden Lotus, who looked af-
ter Her with great care, devotion and love. Not only
this, You are none other than Yashoda in Dwapara
Yuga. Then, as you looked after Me with affectionate
care and tender love, You had an unfulfilled desire to
see My marriage, but that desire could not be fulfilled.
So, Vakulamatha is negotiating the Marriage with
Padmavathi in this birth". Hence, the Marriage is fixed
to be celebrated on Vaisakha Suddha Dasami , Friday
in Poorva Phalguni Nakshatra, when He took a Loan
from Kubera to marry Padmavathi. Then, the Lord
wanted Sri Mahalakshmi to be with Him at the time
of Marriage. He pleaded with Her in several ways. All
the Gods sent the Sun God (Surya) to Kolhapur to
bring Her. She agreed to Accompany the Sun God to
attend the Marriage and gave Him enough comfort
and solace and made the Lord as a Bridegroom in
splendid way. After the Marriage, She left for
Kolhapur, not heeding the Pleas of Lord Srinivasa.
However, after the Marriage, the Lord's mind was
filled with a deep sense of Grief and Loss. He felt that
His life was colourless and meaningless. He expressed
His sorrow to Padmavathi in the following words: "My
Life without Sri Mahalakshmi is full of despair and
futile. After leaving Vaikuntha, I suffered many in-
sults. I hid Myself in the bark of a tree and suffered
thirst and hunger. I was injured brutally by an illiter-
ate shepherd boy. Your servants beat Me up. I also58
59
took Loan from Kubera and was wandering aimlessly!
What fate had befallen on Me! I was once upon a time
the Lord of Vaikuntha. Anyhow, My life has taken a
turn for better after My Marriage with You. My mind
is full of agony and distress after Sri Mahalakshmi
left Me. How can I fulfil the prayers of My devotees
in this state of mind? I Myself will be in a distressed
state of mind, until I have the Kindness of
Mahalakshmi. Therefore, I want to go to Kolhapur to
win Her Grace. I want You to permit Me to go to
Kolhapur". As He spoke these words in great sorrow,
and His condition was pitiable, Padmavathi asked Him
to go to Kolhapur to bring Her. She bid Him farewell.
Thus, Swami left for Kolhapur in Great Hope.
CHAPTER-13
SWAMI'S KOLHAPUR VISIT
As He reached Kolhapur, His mind was filled with
Delight by seeing its Magnificence. Sri Mahalakshmi
was staying there in all Her Glory and Majesty.
Kolhapur appeared All the more beautiful, as He was
till then living in open fields consisting of hills and
valleys. He started appreciating its Splendid Beauty
with great delight. What a Magnificence He found in
Kolhapur! There were Tall Golden Towers all around!
There were scapes. One can see Gold and Diamonds
Shining all around. Golden Gates and Walls were be-
decked with gems and diamonds. There were Broad
streets with Splendid gardens and halls reverberating
with music and lilting sounds. People were showing
great hospitality. Vedas and Puranas were chanted as
Towering Buildings were Shining with Marvellous
Decorations. Thus, all in all, Kolhapur was a Mag-
nificent city, Splendid and Majestic, in all respects.
Sri Mahalakshmi's Temple was at the heart of
Kolhapur, with huge compound walls. Swami was
wandering at the marvellous quality of the Temple of
Sri Mahalakshmi. In its inner side, there was a tall
wall to cross for entering the inner premises. There
was a wall impregnated with many Diamonds and
Gems such as Padmaraga Prakaram (rampart),
Gomedhika Prakaram (rampart), Vajra Prakaram (ram-
part), Vydurya Prakaram (rampart) and Indraneela
Prakaram (rampart). Chintamani Hall is in the midst
of many splendoured halls. In every Prakaram (ram-
part), there were armed soldiers wearing Sankha and
Chakra, protecting the Temple at all times. At the en-
trance of every Prakaram, All the Gods riding on the
Chariots, Elephants and Horses were watching the
Temple. There were wonderful Flower Gardens, Or-
chids and Melodious chirping of birds between the
Prakaras (ramparts). As we tread into the centre
Temple, we find Chintamani hall. It is filled with plea-
sure and great joy. That Diamond Studded Hall has
many Powers. It is Divine too. In that Holy place, Sri60
Mahalakshmi is Sitting in Divine Glory and Rare
Majesty on a Golden Throne, studded with diamonds.
She is the Queen of Great Dignity and Poise. She is
the Goddess, who guided Lakshmi, Parvati and
Saraswati. She is the Parameswari, Omkara Swarupini,
Parathpari. As She is the Jagadeeswari, on both sides,
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali are serving Her.
All the Three Gods (Thrimurthulu), and other
Gods like Indra and other important Gods are their
followers and many such divinities wait at the Divine
Place of Sri Mahalakshmi to have Her Darshan. They
were waiting for Her Grace without feeling tired or
impatient. They were like the traditional chakora birds.
All the people were waiting in Hope for getting Her
Darshan. They were chanting Her name in word and
spirit. But, the Loka Janani was unmoved by them.
Radiant light was Shining from Her Face. From Her
Divine looks, Kindness and Compassion was emanat-
ing from all sides and Blessing all Her devotees. Her
Eyes were overflowing with Enormous Kindness.
There was a Benevolent Smile on Her Lips. She was
the centre of granting Grace and Benediction to all
people around. Even looking at Her, removes all our
sins. She Grants all our wishes. It is our fortune to see
Her. She is a DIVYA MANGALAMURTHI! She sym-
bolizes Eternal Truth, Peace and Bliss! Srinivasa en-
tered Kolhapur with all its Beauty and Kindness to
61
fellow creatures. He looked at the place in great mar-
vel and wonder. There was a Marvellous delight and
feeling of enormity in His Mind . He was walking with
a Pleasant Curiosity to know about Kolhapur. Its
beauty continued to delight Him. He drew attention
from the Rishis, Gods and the pious women as they
began thinking about Him like this: "Who could this
Man be ? Though He has all brightness and splendour
in His demenour, there appears to be a certain amount
of sadness in His Face!" With those feelings, they were
looking at Him now and then, as they went away from
the temple praising the Splendid Beauty of Sri
Mahalakshmi. He entered the Temple, listening to the
words of Praise of Her. To His great surprise, He found
only empty space as all the devotees were looking at
Her in Great Joy. But He decided not to leave
Karavirapura without seeing Her. He wanted to go
back only by taking Her with Him. So, He went on
Penance for Her sake. He was dismayed that Sri
Mahalakshmi was giving Darshan to everybody ex-
cept for Him. He feared that He might have done some
wrongful deed to make Her Angry. Every day, He was
taking Holy Bath in Padmakundam, Kapilathirtham,
Pananaganga and Rudraprayag. He was chanting Her
Name and praying to Her with a lot of Devotion and a
Strong Desire to have Her Darshan. Everybody was
surprised to see why He was making such an arduous
effort, when everybody was able to have Her Darshan,62
63
so easily. But, She was unrelented and did not give
Her Darshan to Him. Srinivasudu also did not lose
hope and did Penance for 10 years with Infinite De-
votion, but to no avail.
CHAPTER-14
THE INVISIBLE VOICE
As He was thus doing Penance with Great Devo-
tion and Determined Will, to have Her Darshan, one
Friday in the Morning, there was a Glittering Light
making all Karavirapura Shine in all its Splendor. As
He was getting ready for His Penance, after Perform-
ing all the Rituals, He Heard quiet Mellisious words
like this: "Oh Srinivasa! You are making Penance for
the Darshan of Sri Mahalakshmi. Carefully listen to
these following words-Sri Mahalakshmi has reached
Kolhapur after leaving You in Vaikuntha to kill an
asura called Kolhasura. Thus, She took This Avatara
in Kolhapur for Loka kalyana. You cannot see Her
now or at any time in Her Present condition as She is
in Ugrarupa i.e., in a State of Mind of Anger. So, for
You to have Her Grace, there is only one way, that is,
You should Create a Lotus Pond on the bank of
Swarnamukhi river by using Your Spear. It is a Holy
Place, where many Rishis are doing their Penance in
their Ashrams. You should Install Golden Lotuses from
Heaven and worship Sri Mahalakshmi for Twelve
Years and then You can have Her Darshan. She will
show all Her Grace to You. She will give Her Darshan
to You in all Her Peace Without Anger. Thus, once
again, She will Unite with You Once Again and Re-
gain Her Position in Your Bosom. Thus, You can ful-
fil all the desires of Your devotees. In Kaliyuga, all
the devotees will chant Your Name as "Kalou Venkata
Nayakaha".
Being filled with Great Satisfaction after listen-
ing to these words, He felt Happy that He could spend
Seven Years in Kolhapur. He could see many Gods
there, than in Kasi and do service to Them. He en-
tered the Temple, where Sri Mahalakshmi was Present
and uttered the following words in Utter Devotion with
His Folded Hands thus: "Oh Mahalakshmi! I will al-
ways be waiting for You and Your Grace. I pray to
You to Give Me Your Grace for Loka kalyana in
Kaliyuga".
CHAPTER-15
SWAMI'S PENANCE
As ordained by Sri Mahalakshmi, He reached
Venkatachala and after taking bath, He had the Darshan
of Varahaswami. He took precaution so that
Vakulamatha and Padmavathi did not know of His
presence there. He reached the northern side of
Swarnamukhi river, near the Ashram of Sri Suka64
Maharshi. He brought many Splendorous Flowers and
built a tank and with the help of Vayudeva, He could
get Golden Lotuses and planted them in the Pond. He
also installed Sun God on the eastern side so that the
Lotus Flowers are always in Bloom. Then, as His pen-
ance became more and more intense, Indra, the King
of Heaven, became afraid of Him and had a fear that
somebody was doing Penance to dethrone him. He
immediately sent Apsaras to obstruct His Penance.
Those Apsaras tried all their tricks to obstruct His
Penance, but to no avail and they returned. Like this,
His Penance continued unabated for Twelve Years and
continued into the Thirteenth Year also. As He was
doing Penance for the Darshan and Grace of Sri
Mahalakshmi, in Venkatachala, Padmavathi's condi-
tion was no better. As He left Venkatachala leaving
behind Her Twenty Two Years ago, She was leading a
life of despair and sorrow and loneliness. She told Her
Misery to Vakulamatha, Unable to control Her sor-
row any longer in these words: "Oh, great mother,
Vakuladevi! I had a dream. In that dream, I had seen
My Lord facing many difficulties, suffering Thirst and
Hunger. I am deeply disturbed to see Him to lead a
life of suffering". She broke down inconsolably. To
those words of sorrow of Padmavathi, Vakuladevi
consoled Her thus: "My dear daughter, Padmavathi!
You are the daughter of Akasaraju and You are also
65
the Princess. But, You are weeping like a coward. Your
Husband is also an Extraordinary Human Being. He
is none other than Sri Mahavishnu. He will soon re-
turn; so do not weep like an Ordinary Soul. You can
trust my words". With these words, She got Greatly
relieved and got Courage. Elsewhere, all the sages like
Kapila and others, on seeing the Penance of Sri
Mahavishnu, which was of the Highest Order, went
to Pathalaloka to tell Sri Mahalakshmi about it and
Prayed to Her not to be Angry any longer and go to
Him. Kapilamuni also advised Her to Understand and
Accept the Good Heart of Sri Mahavishnu, who was
Repenting for His Past Mistake. Bhrigu Maharshi,
whose senseless anger and pride caused the separa-
tion, also prayed to Her with folded hands like this:
"Oh Mother to All Humanity and Divine Source of
All Riches, what I have done in hitting at the Heart of
Sri Mahavishnu, which is the Seat of Yours is a ter-
rible deed, for which there is no excuse. But, let me
tell You, I did so, on the advice of Narada and other
Rishis, who wanted the world to know His kind and
Your Hearand love. But, I know, my behaviour was
unpardonable, in any manner and therefore, pardon
me and Go and Reach Your Lord Who is in Great
Agony, Without You. Understanding that She might
have acted in haste, and accepting that perhaps, women
are also some times responsible for the sorry plight of66
67
their families, She disappeared from Pathalaloka from
Kapilamahamuni's Ashram.
CHAPTER-16
ALAMELU MANGA'S INCARNATION
It was a Momentous Occasion. It was the day all
the humanity was Fortunate to realize that their desire
was fulfilled. It was the Holiest of days. It was in
Karthika Masa, Suklapaksha Panchami, Friday, in
Uttarashada Nakshatra and Vijaya Lagna that Sri
Mahalakshmi Appeared in the Golden Lotus Pond.
That Golden Lotus Pond was Resplendent in all the
Brilliant Hues and spreading its Fragrance all around.
As She was Appearing, Bedecked with all the Rarest
of Diamonds and Gems, it was a Divine Spectacle and
a Divine Moment. It was an occasion when all around
there were Mellifluous Songs and Nature was Deco-
rating Itself in all its Splendid Joy. There was a Shower
of Divine Blessings.
Jayatu jayatu Lakshmeerlakshanaalan kritangi
Jayatu jayatu Padma padmasadmabhivandya
Jayatu jayatu vidya vishnuvamankasanstha
Jayatu jayatu samyak sarvasampatkari sreeh
Gandharvas were dancing with infinite joy. She
was Bedecked in the Golden Chariot Appearing as a
Sixteen Years Old Divinely Beautiful Girl. Nobody
can describe Her Divine Beauty. As Her Eyes were
Glittering in Their Beauty, Her Face was Shining like
the Full Moon. Her Beauty was Multiplied by the
Beauteous Smile on Her Lips. As Her Nose was so
Beautiful and Sharp like the Bud of the Sampenga
Flower, Her Teeth were Shining in Their Brilliance,
in White Colour. Her Forelocks were moving ever so
tenderly by the gentle breeze of the Padmasarovara.
They were curling and gently moving like the Black
Bees. She was none other than the Mother of Our
Universe. Her Presence was made all the More Glit-
tering with the Golden Crown Shining on Her Head.
Her Neck was decorated with Many Ornaments. She
was wearing Bangles in Her Hands, Anklets and
Waistbelt. She was moving ever so gingerly and
spendidly with rarest of Beauty and Charm, that all
the Universe was Spellbound by Her Presence. The
Golden Lotus Flowers were shining in Her Hands, as
She was also wearing the Golden Lotus round Her
Neck. In this manner, She Appeared as the Sixteen
Year Girl in Her Beauty, giving Ecstatic delight, to us.
Then, all the people started chanting Her praise like
this: "Oh Mother of all humanity! All the joy and Good-
ness flow from You. Oh Goddess! You, who was
Praised by Brahma, always victory comes to You. You,
who is always present in Sri Vishnu is a symbol of All
Knowledge. You are the Giver of All Knowledge. You68
69
are the Giver of all forms of Wealth, Strength and
Courage. All the good things happen to us because of
You". Her immortal Greatness is eulogized by the
Rishis, Yogis and Sages of all times and Gods.
Srinivasa was also inspired to see Her Beauty in a
Moment of Joy. Then, He stopped His Penance. As
She has reached Him after so much of time, separa-
tion and agony, He put the Kalhara Mala and brought
Her closest to His Bosom. Thus, when Srinivasa and
Padmavathi came Together, all the Yakshas,
Gandharvas and Kinneras showered their Floral Bless-
ings on Them. They also sang the Holiest and Happi-
est songs. They were also praised by Brahma and other
Gods.

To these prayers, She Blessed Her devotees like
this: "It gives Me great pleasure to see all the Gods
and My devotees. I will Grant the prayers of all of My
devotees, who worship Me with the Holy leaves of
the Bilva Tree and they will get all those valuable
things and property they have lost and will achieve all
round progress in their lives. I will Bless them with
all the fulfilment of their desires in this world and else-
where, easily. All the devotees who have taken bath
in This Holy Lotus Pond Today, will have long and
happy life. I will Bless them with Good Learning,
Good Children and Wealth". All the Gods Praised Her70
71
in their humility with great devotion since She was
born in the Golden Lotus Pond, they would call Her
by various Divine names, as Padmasani, Padmahasta
and Padmavathi and they Prostrated before Her with
devotion. Afterwards, Srinivasa once again invited Sri
Mahalakshmi, (who was present as Padmavathi) to be
in His Bosom, in the Holy Presence of all the Gods,
Thumbura and Narada and other Sages and many
devotees. Thus, once again, Sri Mahalakshmi returned
to His Bosom as VYUHALAKSHMI and Padmavathi
with Two Golden Lotuses in Her Hands lived in Sri
Swami's Bosom and sat on the Golden Lotus.as Sowmyalakshmi; and as Keerthilakshmi and
Sowmyalakshmi and Sarvasamrajyalakshmi. Thus,
She is Present from His Feet to His Entire Body. She
is also responsible for making Him a Wealthy Man.
CHAPTER-17Therefore, She is Praised as Tirumala Srinivasa,
thus: from Foot to Heart, who is made the Embodi-
ment of wealth, we pray that He lives always in Hap-
piness. Because of Her inalienable relationship with
Him, He is called Anandanilaya. Because of this, He
is called "Kalau Venkatanayakaha". It means that He
offers Wealth, the Qualities of Charity, Prowess, Kind-
ness, Fame and balance of mind. All Gods Praise Him,
as Eight forms of Goddesses are present in Him, in
these words;
HOW SRI MAHALAKSHMI APPROACHED
SRINIVASA
Thus, after finding Her place in the Lotus of Di-
vinity in Sri Vishnu's Bosom, Sri Mahalakhmi came
to be known as VYUHALAKSHMI and
BHUTHAKARUNYALAKSHMI (splendor of com-
passion to all created beings). Because of Her Kind-
ness, devotees call Her BHUTHAMAHALAKSHMI.
She also appears on Swami's Body by many names
such as Bhagyalakshmi; She is called Dhanalakshmi
as She is Present in His Tender Hands! Veeralakshmi
as She is on His Two Shoulders! she is Present in His
Bosom as Bhuthakarunyalakshmi and in His Sword

"Oh Swami! You have the Mind of Srilakshmi in
Your Bosom. You are Lakshmipathi. Always You are
in the Happy Company of Sri Mahalakshmi. We get
everything by chanting Your name. Like this, every-
body is filling his or her mind with the joy of chanting
their names!" Thus, He is called Srinivasa, as He is
Bestowed with Plentitude of Wealth, as He is in the
Presence of Sri Mahalakshmi. As He was thus going
to Venkatachalam, (from Padmasarovaram) along with
Sri Mahalakshmi, all the Gods and Rishis like Suka,
and His devotees were praying to Him like this: "Oh
God of Gods! We want to celebrate the Holiest mo-
ment, when Sri Mahalakshmi Appeared as Alamelu
Manga and Padmavathi". Then Lord Brahma per-
formed Brahmotsavams for Sri Padmavathi. In those
celebrations, every morning and evening, She was car-
ried on a Palanquin. Like this, arrangements were made
for the celebrations of Sri Mahalakshmi as "Swatantra
Veeralakshmi". Every year on the Panchami, the day
when She Appeared, Saree and Other Valuable things
are brought from Tirumala Swami. Not only this, as a
symbol of Her Appearing there, Sri Mahalakshmi is
worshipped in 'Archa Rupam'. As per the request of
Her devotees, Tirumala Srinivasa showered All His
Blessings on them.

CHAPTER-18
DIALOGUE BETWEEN PADMAVATHI AND
VYUHALAKSHMI
In the meanwhile, in Anandanilaya, where
Padmavathi, the daughter of Aakasaraju expressed Her
Anguish and Loneliness, all these Twenty Two Years
to Srinivasa, She told Him like this: "Oh dear Swami!
I can no longer bear this separation from You and from
now onwards, do not leave Me". To these words,
Srinivasa, in His Inimitable Gentle Style, with Ten-
derness and Love, consoled Her like this: "You are
not an ordinary human being: Your birth has a Divine
cause. In Tretayuga, you were Vedavati, who went to
Lanka as Sita. You are the Very Incarnation of Vedas
and Sri Mahalakshmi. You are Born in This Vedabhumi
which is made Holier by Your Birth. I will not leave
You again and You will live in My Bosom as
VYUHALAKSHMI. You and Alamelu Manga may
Appear differently but You are One and the Same. Not
only this, My Avatara now is Unique and Valuable. In
all My Earlier Avataras, My Wives were Consorts; but
in This Avatara, as Srinivasa, there are no wives, as
all of them are Present in Me. I am in the Fullness of
Wealth, as I was in Vaikuntha. By thinking of Me will
remove all the sins and by Praising Me, All Desires
will be Fulfilled. By having My DARSHAN, the mind
will be filled with Inexplicable Joy". Thus, when74
75
Srinivasa took Her close to Him, Padmavathi became
"VYUHALAKSHMI" living in the Bosom of
Srinivasa. She also became Bhuthakarunyalakshmi by
showing Her Kindness to all the Creatures. Thus, Sri
Mahalakshmi was Present as VYUHALAKSHMI by
being Present in Srinivasa's Bosom. Thus, people are
worshiping Her in both of these Avataras. As Time
was thus unfolding itself, the Lord of the Seven Hills
spoke to Mahalakshmi.
CHAPTER-19
DIALOGUE BETWEEN SWAMI AND
VYUHALAKSHMI
Now we come to know a very interesting episode
in the conversation of Sri Mahavishnu and Sri
Mahalakshmi, when Swami tells Her like this: "Oh
My Dear Divine Self ! We have been separated for
such a long time after We left Vaikuntha. Now, I am
very Happy that once again You have installed Your-
self in My Bossom. Therefore, from now onwards,
You must participate in all the activities on this Earth.
You must shower Your Blessings on Humanity. When
I Married Padmavathi You were there. I think You re-
member that event. For the Expenses of Our Marriage,
I had to Borrow so much Money, from Lord Kubera. I
have been Paying Interest on that Loan since then and
as the interest is growing, I am worried not knowing
how to Repay it. Therefore, I am pleading You to sug-
gest some way out of this predicament". To this, Sri
Mahalakshmi, replied thus, in a somewhat Angry man-
ner-"Oh My Lord! first of all, You took that Loan on
Your own. You have invited Me to that marriage but
You did not think of taking that Loan From Me. Had
You asked, I would have given that money and now
Your suffering would not have been there. I felt be-
littled when You asked money from Lord Kubera, and
not Me. Every one was ridiculing that, You did not
take money from Me, as You were known as
Lakshmipathi. Naturally, I felt-deeply sorrowful as
everybody was making fun of You. So, I became An-
gry and left for Kolhapur, unable to bear with Your
cunning nature. Even as You came to see Me in
Kolhapur, I went to Pathalaloka. I hope, at least, now,
You have realized My Sorrow and Pain". To these
words, He replied thus consoling Her: "Oh My dear
Sridevi! there is one important reason for not taking
money from You. You have not yet recovered from
the pangs of Our separation and Your presence at My
Second Marriage was a sufficient Gift for Me. Hence,
asking money at that time was inappropriate, I thought.
So, I did not think it right to Ask You". Then, Sri
Mahalakshmi, known for Her Kind Heartedness, in
All Happiness, asked Him to forget the past and prom-
ised to give the money to pay to Lord Kubera. Over-
whelmed with Joy, He praised Her and asked Her not76
to give Him the entire money, as He would like to pay
Only the Interest till the End of Kailyuga. After pay-
ing the Total Amount at the End of Kaliyuga, They
would Return to Vaikuntha. Till then, They would give
Their Blessings to the people in this Place, known as
'Kaliyuga Vaikuntha'. He told His opinion to Her like
this: "I am only Seeking Your Help in saving the
trouble -torn humanity, Our Goal is always
Lokoddharana (welfare of humanity) - People in
Kaliyuga, knowingly or unknowningly, commit many
mistakes, resulting in their suffering. When they crave
for Our Blessings to remove their sufferings, with their
prayers, "Govinda", "Govinda" We must become one
with them with unfailing readiness to help them in
removing their sufferings and agonies of life. They
pray to Us like this; "Help us Oh Lord! when we are
hungry, tired and emaciated and faced with many dif-
ficulties in society". They continuously chant Our
Names to reach This Venkatadri. They pray to Us in
all their agonies and difficulies. Whoever prays to Me
with Ardent Devotion, I will Accept their Wealth and
Money- whoever suffers from diseases and have
Money ill- begotten from sinful activities, I will Re-
lieve Them of their sins. In this manner, I will not
purify them of their past sins but make them lose their
ill- begotten wealth. This does not mean that I am ac-
cepting only the money of sinful people, I also accept
77
the offerings and gifts given by Good people and devo-
tees and people who have Faith and Devotion Towards
Me. Some devotees offer their gifts out of devotion
without accepting any thing in return from Us. Some
Devotees Offer Their Wealth For Serving Humanity. I
Will give some such money from these noble minds
to Lord Kubera as interest for the money I have taken
from him. I will also spend this money for the Welfare
of Pilgrims, for Their Health, Education and Provid-
ing Food and Succour to Them. Therefore, I Need Not
Withdraw The Loan Repayment Agreements Which
is Valid till the End of Kaliyuga"- However, not satis-
fied with His words, She wanted to find out why He
asked Her money from Her. To this, the Lord, with a
Gentle Smile as always on His Face told Her like this:
"My only Plea to You is to Grant More Wealth to the
devotees so that, I, in turn, can Accept their Money".
However, not being convinced with His words, She
further told Him that the human beings, in Kaliyuga
are full of greed and evil mind. There is no use in
giving money to them and so She would not give them
money from Her Hands. She will only give that money
to Him; He Himself can give that money to them. Then,
the Lord, in His Gentle Manner, told Her to give the
money to the devotees, while He would get that money
from them by removing all their obstacles and Bless
them with children and make them Happy; their hap-78
piness will give Him Greater Fulfilment and Joy. But,
even while She remained stubborn in saying that the
human beings in Kaliyuga are evilsome and greedy,
He began to convince Her with these words of pity
and great compassion to Help even the sinful human-
ity: "I will Appear in the dreams of some of the devo-
tees, who are suffering from diseases and past sins,
and make them pay some money as part of their debt,
while they cannot any way pay the total amount, the
interest will increase making them afraid of their sins.
Fearing that I would punish them, they would come
closer to Me and I will remove all their diseases and
sufferings and collect all the interest from them. I will
separate the money from the noble minds from the
money of the bad people and I will give all the sinful
money to the bad people, to make them suffer. As a
result, all the bad people will suffer the consequences
of all their sinful acts of the past. Whereas, I will Spend
All The Good Money for the Welfare of Noble Activi-
ties to Spread all the Messages of Spiritual Wisdom
and Happiness of life in this Holy Place. Thus, You
are granting Greater Blessings and fulfilment even for
small offerings from them. As a result, many people
come here to fully realize the Greatness and Splendour
of This Place. The Kshetra Mahima will spread Far
and Wide. Everybody will feel Strengthned to believe
that This Kshetra is Created only to relieve them of
79
their sufferings. In My own way, I will be their Bene-
factor. As You Grant them More Wealth, they will use
that money for celebrating many Holy Festivals and
offering many Gifts to Me. Thus, Oh Mahalakshmi!
Once again I plead to You, to give Me Great Strength
and capacity to give MOKSHA to the devotees". As
these words elated Her thoughts, She told Him thus;
"Oh Great Lord! Now in this moment, I promise You,
that, I will grant endless wealth to all the devotees, I
will also punish all those miserly people". By thus be-
coming His VYUHALAKSHMI, She Granted infinite
wealth to the devotees. In this way, Lord Venkateswara
is present as the Main Deity as Sri Mahalakshmi is
Present in His Bosom as VYUHALAKSHMI. Thus
in Venkatachala, "Kaliyuga Vaikuntham" is estab-
lished. He is praised and worshipped as 'KALAU
VENKATA NAYAKAHA'. As She is present in His
Bosom, She called Herself as "Srinivasa", By Their
presence, They are spreading Their Glory and Mag-
nificence in This World. Therefore, from then onwards
everybody in many forms of worship such as
Thomalaseva, Archana and Naivedya are being per-
formed to Worship Him. After these Sevas to Swami,
similar Sevas are performed for Alamelu Manga, too,
and on Every Friday, Abhishekam is performed to Her.
For Swami also Abhishekam is performed. It is a plea-
sure and immense joy for all of us to Chant Her Names.80
81
She is the Giver of peace, as She is the Queen of
the Bosom of Sri Mahavishnu. She is the most Be-
loved of Him, as She is the Embodiment of Karuna,
Compassion. Seating Herself on the tenderest Lotus
Petals, She Herself shines ever so Beautifully on those
Lotus-Petals. Being ever present in His Bosom, She
is the Eternal Embodiment of Love, Karuna (compas-
sion). We Salute Her, as She is Worshipped by all the
Gods. "Oh Mother! All the suffering humanity prays
to You for redemption of their sorrows! You are the
Dhathri, Mother Earth! We salute You.
Matassamasta jagatam Madhukytabhareh

You are the Mother of the World. You have killed

som, You make a Beautiful presence, fulfilling the
desires of the devotees! You are Dearest to Swami.
Let All Good Things Happen to You!"

Swami is also known as "Srinivasa" as She is
present in His Bosom. "Sri" means, embodiment of
karuna, love: as She Bestows Her love on all the crea-82
83
tures. Not only this, She makes Swami also Shower
His Blessings on all the creatures. Hence, She is also
known as Bhuthakarunyalakshmi. She endears Her-
self to Swami by Seating Herself in a small protru-
sion. She has a Noble purpose by first listening to Her
devotees' prayers with a lot of Love and Kind Patience
and then not only passion them onto Swami but sees
that Swami fulfils all their desires. Thus, She is truly
instrumental in fulfilling Her devotees' prayers. She
is, thus, known as VYUHALAKSHMI - Vyuha means
secret - it means She is present hidden, unseen by us
in the mind and spirit of Srinivas and make Him fulfil
desires of devotees. Let us now know one noble story
of how She showered Her infinite Kindness on Her
devotees.
CHAPTER-21
HER DIVINE GRACE
This is the noble story of a devoted Brahmin,
called Atmaram of Madhya Pradesh. He was known
as Atmaram, as he used to spend all his time in think-
ing and chanting God's infinite names. He used to revel
at the many kinds of God's wonderful deeds and went
on mulling over them. Thus, he spent all his time in
experiencing divine presence in his thoughts and
deeds. Thus, people called him Atmaram, but his real
name was unknown. People in that kingdom showed
a lot of reverence to his deeds and thoughts. He used
to feed all his friends and relatives every day, unmind-
ful of the time and he also used to give them sermons
about good habits and thoughts. It is, indeed, gratify-
ing to see that. Atmaram used this human life, which
is God's gift, in all Divine Activities, but as he spent
all his wealth in those activities, he became poor and
faced many difficulties. As a result, he had to leave
his house and his native place. He became a vaga-
bond. After thus moving from place to place like a
helpless vagabond, finally, he reached Venkatachala
Kshetra to realize his life's ambition of getting Swami's
KARUNA. He reached Kapilatheertham, which is lo-
cated at the foot of the Seven Hills. He worshipped
Sri Kapileswara Swami, who is in the companionship
of Sri Kamakshi. Afterwards, as he was climbing
Venkatadri Hillock, he saw a very interesting cave,
where he wanted to take rest. He heard the 'Omkara
naada' from inside that cave. As he entered the cave,
he saw a yogi sitting on the stone and doing Penance.
He prostrated before that yogi; his name was
Sanathkumara. He told that yogi his pathetic story of
how he had lost his house and households and his wife
and became a vagabond. The yogi using his divine
vision, consoled the sorrowful brahmin with these
words: "Oh Brahmin (lord of the earth)! All your84
85
present suffering is because of your past sins in your
earlier birth. You have atoned all your past sins as you
have taken the Holy Bath in Kapilatheertham. You
must seek the blessings of Sri Mahalakshmi. At
present, She is present as VYUHALAKSHMI in the
Bosom of Sri Venkateswara Swami in This Holy
Venkatadri Kshetra. If you get Her Blesings all your
sorrows will disappear and you will once again lead a
happy life. I will teach you Vyuhalakshmi
Mahamantra.

Every day, by praying to Sri Mahalakshmi after
taking bath thrice a day, chanting this Mahamantra,
you can win Her KARUNA and all your desires will
be fulfilled. You must chant this Mahamantra with sin-
cerity and purity of mind. Then the yogi taught the
following words:
"Sri Mahalakshmi is shining like the full moon.
She is not only the beloved of Him, but She bestows
Her KARUNA on Her devotees, through Her Benevo-
lent looks. She not only removes all kinds of faults,
She also Pardons the sins of past births. Her kind ac-
tions are known in this world as Lakshmi, Keerthi and
Jaya. Of them, She is present as "Lakshmi" in the
Bosom of Sri Venkateswara. Her Divine Splendor be-86
87
comes Resplendent with Her Kindness to Her devo-
tees. She is also the source of Eternal Wealth. I am
now giving you a Holy Mantra, the Source Mantra
(Beejakshara) about such a Mother of the Universe
"VYUHALAKSHMI" and I want you to chant it: You
must chant by adding the words, veda, matha,
Lakshmi, Paramalakshmi, Vishnuvakshitahi,
maya,tarika, vannijani. If you chant the mantra, like
this, She will Endow you with all the Riches. Thus,
Atmaram, if you take Holy bath thrice a day, in the
Pushkarini of the Swami and if you worship Her with
devotion, you will get Her Benevolence. This is the
only sure way for you to achieve your Wealth and True
Happiness".
Thus, Atmaram after having the darshan of the
great Sanathkumara Yogi and knowing the Divine Sri
Mahalakshmi Mahamantra, went to Venkatachala by
taking a dip in the Holy rivers with devotion on his
way and he was spell bound after seeing the Glitter-
ing Ananda Nilaya Vimana; after doing pradakshina ,
he completed taking the bath in the pushkarini, which
is brought from Vaikuntha by Sri Mahavishnu onto
This earth!
Swami pushkarini snanam sadguroh
padasevanam
Ekadasi vratam chapi traya matyanta
durlabham
Durlabham manushamjanma, durlabham
tatrajeevanam
Swami pushkarini snanam trayamatyanta
durlabham
There are three noble things one can fulfil: taking
bath in the Holy Pushkarini; following Ekadasi Vratha
on the Holy Ekadasi thithi, and performing the
Padaseva of sadguru; also being born as a human self,
and living with humanity. Therefore, Atmaram is for-
tunate in all these aspects. After taking bath, he first
had the Darshan of Sri Swethavaraha swami accord-
ing to the tradition of the Kshetra; he followed this by
having the Darshan of Sri Adivaraha swami. Then, he
praised Lord Venkateswara in these words: "He is the
Lord, who has made this Venkatachala Kshetra a place
for fulfilling all the desires of his devotees. How won-
derful is He, Resplendent with Beauty! His Face is
made beautiful with Lotus-like Eyes with a Benign
Smile Glittering on His Face. His Feet are tinkling
with quietly Resonant bells on His Tender Feet. There
is a Glittering Golden Sword. He is Shining in a silk
dress, with a Waist Chain (vaddanam)! Lotus in His
navel, in His Hands Shining with SANKHA
CHAKRAS, Kaustubhamani on His Heart and Glit-
tering Diamond Chains on It. His Glittering body is
decorated with many chains and Ear Lobes. His Head
is bedecked with the Diamond Crown! What a Splen-88
89
did Beauty! How Divine is it, indescribable Beauty is
it! How fortunate are the people of this Earth! They
are Blessed by Sri Venkateswara, who is known as
the God of Kaliyuga (KALAU VENKATA
NAYAKAHA). He has given His Incarnation on Earth
for giving Darshan to the people of This Earth.
Atmaram's mind was filled with devotional fervour.
So, he was feeling ecstatic on seeing His Most Su-
premely Beautiful Appearance. He was also offering
His prayers to VYUHALAKSHMI like this: "Oh
Mother of the Universe! Mahalakshmi! You are re-
sponsible for the Greatness of the Swami! You are
Shining in His Bosom to drive away all our sins and
make us cross the most fearful experience of making
our journey in this SAMSARA, which is a dark, laby-
rinthine, inscrutable space. Your Greatness is inesti-
mable than all the Beautiful things in this world! All
the Gods pray at Your Feet as Your Benign looks drive
away all our suffering and all the learned people shine
with Your Kindness on them.
Lakshmi pradana samaye navavidrumabham
Vidya pradana samaye saradindu subhram
Vidveshi varga vijaye cha tamala neelam
Devim triloka jananeem saranam prapadye
You are Shining with all the Glittering purity of
the Full Moon. You are the Mother of Lord Brahma
and Manmatha. All the Gods are Your Children.
Through You, we submit our prayers to Him as Your
Kindness is infinite and inestimable. You showed on
us the Real and Eternal Pleasures of Truth. Oh Mother!
You are the Daughter of the PALASAMUDRA (Sea
of Milk) as you are also the Benevolent, Royal Con-
sort to Sri Venkateswara, who is resting on Seshathalpa
in PALASAMUDRA (Sea of Milk). You grant us both
Material Pleasures and Divine Bliss". With these
prayers, Atmaram made Upasana of Sri Mahalakshmi
with the help of the Divine Mantra, taught to him by
Sanathkumara yogi. Thus, Atmaram by devoutly wor-
shiping Swami and Sri Mahalakshmi at Venkatachala
Kshetra, which is the Holiest Place on This Planet,
reached a supreme level of Spiritual Delight. He had
the pleasure of a good teacher (Sadguru) divine man-
tra (divya mantram) and holy place (Punya Kshetram).
Thus, he spent all his life in the worship of Swami
and Sri Mahalakshmi. Being deeply devoted to Her
worship, he lived in his own world. Naturally, this
mundane world thought him to be a mad man. He spent
six months in that manner, truly living in His pres-
ence and worshiping and performing "Upasana" of Sri
Mahalakshmi, present in Swami's Bosom as
VYUHALAKSHMI. In response to his devotion, one
day Sri Venkateswara Appeared before him, along with
Sri Mahalakshmi. He was spellbound on seeing Him90
91
- marvellous presence - Shining with the Golden
Crown, Ear rings and Her Benign Presence. Filled with
an Ecstatic feeling, he chanted His Divine names. Be-
ing filled with satisfaction, Swami told Atmaram these
following words: "Atmaram! By taking bath in the
Holy Pushkarini all your past sins have been atoned
and by your fervent devotion (Upasana) to Sri
Mahalakshmi, you have part- taken Her KARUNA.
Hence, from now onwards, you may show your char-
ity in a happy manner, without losing your wealth".
After being Blessed by the Divine Vision of Swami
and Sri Mahalakshmi, he returned to his village with
a fulfilled mind. He also did not forget Sanathkumara,
his path-finder for Divine Bliss and continued his
charitable activities. Thus, Sri Mahalakshmi is present
in His Bosom to make him Srimatha and Srinivasa.
Dwibhuja vyuhalakshmihi syat badha
padmasana priya
Srinivasam ga madhyasta sutaram kesava
priya
Tameva saranam gacha sarvabhavena
satvaram
She is responsible for fulfilling all our desires and
hopes. She is present in His Bosom as a small spot in
His heart, as Srivatsa, symbolizing Her Benign Kind-
ness. She is known as Lakshmi - "Lakshma" means a
mark. Lakshmi is a symbol of Her infinite kindness.
Hence, She is showing Her kindness to all the crea-
tures in this world.
CHAPTER-22
VYUHALAKSHMI AS ANANTHALVAN’S
DAUGHTER
Let us know the story of a great devotee called
Ananthalvan, who is a contemporary of Sri Bhagavat
Ramanuja (1017-1137) and his disciple. Ananthalvan
reached the Holy Place called Tirumala, as ordained
by his teacher to worship Swami with Fragrant Flow-
ers. So, he wanted to develop a garden himself along
with His wife. He dug a small tank with the help of
his wife. As he felt it was a Divine Activity, he wanted
himself to undertake the hard work by not involving
any body other than his wife. However, Swami wanted
to help His devotee in this activity and Appeared as a
Small Boy to offer His Help. But, Ananthalvan re-
fused His Help and drove away That Boy. However,
He continued to Help His fervent devotee without his
knowledge in Helping his wife in carrying the soil.
Realizing this, Ananthalvan became angry and threw
the crow bar at Him, by which He was injured in His
Chin. Failing to control his anger, he ran after the Small
Boy, who Disappeared into a small hut. When he went
to have His Darshan, after a while, he saw Srinivasa's92
Bruised Chin being attended to by the priests, who
were telling among themselves, that Injury might have
been caused by some devotee. On seeing Srinivasa, in
the Tender Face of That Small Boy, he was spell- bound
to realize that the Small Boy was none other than
Swami Himself. There are many such marvellous tales
in the life of this noble devotee: We can see the crow-
bar used by Ananthalvan being hung on the northern
side of temple's main entrance (Mahadwara). It is also
written as "Ananthalvan's crowbar".
There is another tale of Holiness in the life of his
devotee, which we should know: he developed a mar-
velous garden with the most beautiful plants; such as
tulasi, chrysanthemum, jasmine, lotus, roses, besides,
kanakambara, machipatra, davanam, like this there
were many many plants. Every day; he used to de-
voutly make garlands with the most fragrant flowers
and dedicate them to Him at the Thomalaseva. In those
beautiful garlands, Swami's Beauty become even more
Splendid. Thus, Swami had a desire like this: "When
the flowers themselves are so beautiful, the garden
must be even more joyful. So I should visit that won-
derful garden Myself". So, He left for the garden after
the completion of Ekanta seva. Spell- bound by its
splendid beauty, beyond words, Swami and Sri
Mahalakshmi experienced the supreme bliss of the
garden. They were in a way, playful like children ex-
93
changing fragrant flowers. While Swami decorated
Supreme Mother in Her hair-do, He Himself smelling
their fragrance, threw the beautiful flowers around.
Mother was no less delighted; marvelling Herself at
the scintillating beauty and sweet fragrance of the
flowers, She spent Her time in a very happy manner,
forgetting Herself. Not only this, She shared Her de-
light with Swami. While They spent Their time in su-
preme delight that night, next morning, Ananthalvan
became angry and frustrated on seeing the garden be-
ing thus devastated. Scolding the people, who caused
so much destruction to his garden, he decided to keep
a watch of it, every night, but he failed to catch hold
of those "thieves", who went on taking away flowers.
Feeling despaired, he prayed to Swami with a deeply
beholden self: "Oh Swami! Venkateswara! I cannot
protect my garden. I pray to You to protect the garden
Yourself! Oh! Mother, at least You should save the
garden". Moved by His bhakta's prayers, Swami and
Mother decided to help him. On the ninth night,
Ananthalvan was keeping a watch of the garden, by
hiding himself behind the tulasi plants, he apprehended
that somebody was moving around, Silently moving
behind the plants, he vaguely saw two persons, a male
and a female walking hand in hand in a joyful manner
and beginning to take away flowers, and in a fit of
uncontrollable anger, he caught hold of Both of Them.94
While They were grappling with him, the Male ran
away, leaving behind the Female individual alone.
Ananthalvan, feeling that at least he could catch one
of Them, tied Her to the Sampenga tree and questioned
'who are you?' She told him half in fear like this: My
dear son, I am like your mother, Leave Me Alone. My
Husband destroyed the garden; He is a thief. Any way,
you cannot catch Him and We will not come to your
garden any more". But, unmindful of Her prayer, he
ran after Her Husband, who went round the temple in
the Opposite Direction (Apradakshina) and finally dis-
appeared at the garden. Believing that anyway, Her
Husband would come there to take Her, He slept near
the sampenga tree.
Next morning, when the precious Golden Gates
of Swami's Temple were opened, the priests chanted
Suprabhatha and were anxious in not seeing Sri
Mahalakshmi in the Form of Golden Icon in Swami's
Bosom. As they were deeply disturbed, swami told
the priests like this: "You do not at all worry about
Alamelu Manga. She is at Present in a Human Form
in Ananthalvan's Garden, Tied to the sampangi plant
there. You go there in a Ceremonious Manner, and
tell Ananthalvan to bring Her in a Flower-Bedecked
basket like a Bride, like Her father; He will convince
Her. As they went and told Ananthalvan, the words of
Swami's words, that he was Divinely Blessed, and
95
prostrated before him for his pure devotion, he felt
deeply Humble and he Apologized to the Mother and
took Her in a Holy procession to the Temple and pre-
sented Her to Swami. Immediately, She Disappeared
from the flower - bedecked basket to Enter Swami's
Bosom. Then, Swami told his devotee like this: My
dear uncle! Ananthalvan You have given your Daugh-
ter, Sri Mahalakshmi (VYUHALAKSHMI) and per-
formed your duty as Her father, you are my father-in-
law who gave your daughter to Me in Marriage. So,
your story will live Eternally".
Even today, after Brahmotsavams and
Dhwajarohana, as a remembrance of the sampangi
plant where She was tied, Sri Swami would go round
the temple in Apradakshina (opposite direction) in a
chariot to Ananthalvan's garden. Thus, Ananthalvan's
story became eternal. Even now, his descendents par-
ticipate in offering flowers to make their lives Holy.
We can see this garden as also Samadhi in the south-
western side of Swami's temple. Born in 1053, he was
36 years younger to his guru and died after 84 years
after spending all his life in giving flowers to Swami.
He left for Heavenly Abode on Purvaphalguna (Pubba)
star on "Thiruvadpuram day", he achieved
paramapadam. It is significant that it was on the same
day that Godadevi was also born. On that day of his
Samadhi, Srinivasa with His Consorts visit the Gar-96
97
den and Decorates it with Floral Garlands and
Sathari(in vaishnava tradition, it is a thing resembling
a crown, with Vishnu's feet impressed on it. It is placed
on the devotee's head in the temples). Even today, that
is how we see, how Swami remembering His devotee's
devotion and celebrates His love for His devotees.
CHAPTER-23
ALAMELU MANGA'S KINDNESS
Now let us know another story of another great
devotee, who is the very Incarnation of Sri
Venkateswara, that is, Tallapaka Annamayya, who is
born as the Embodiment (amsa) of Swami's Sword
(that is Nandakayudha). He is also said to be the In-
carnation of Sri Hari. He is so blessed that Swami used
to give His Darshan to him to fulfil all his desires.
Therefore, he got Swami's Blessings for His Darshan
to three of his generations and sanction Moksha (lib-
eration) to the next generations and perform sevas,
the sevas at His Divine Feet for all the generations of
his family.
He also won the Kindness of His Royal Consort
Alamelu Mangamma. Hence, he is known as the
Blessed Annamacharya (VARALABDHUDAN
NAMACHARYA) and APPANI VARAPRASADI
ANNAMAYYA. There are many, many interesting sto-
ries, which create perennial devotion in us. There are
at least two stories of devotion of his like how he grew
from an ordinary boy to a Great Devotee of the Swami.
First, there is this story of naturally born devotion
to Swami from childhood, when, at the age of eight as
a child, he was rescued by Alamelu Manga Herself,
when he was tired and could not continue his journey
to Tirumala. The second is a real life incident in his
life when the Mother Herself gave evidence in sup-
port of him for deciding the dispute between Jandras
and Padmasalees. We came to know the first story
through China Thiru Vengalanadhudu (who is also
called Chinnanna), the grandson of Annamayya. He
has also written many KAVYAS and is a learned man
and the family deity (Kula Devata) for weavers.
Annamayya lived in a small village called Tallapaka.
The village is known as Tallapaka as the huts were
covered with palmarin leaves. All the eighty houses
in that village looked like Ashrams of the erstwhile
Rishis. There is one small Chennakesava temple at
the end of the village, built by Janamejaya Maharaj,
while there is another temple, Siddeswaralayam, which
appeared to be more like a palace, innovated by
Pramada Ganalu. While both of these temples were
ancient and of great value and significance, the walls
of the Chennakeseva Swami temple and Crescent
(Gopuram) show, on close observation, that it is a more98
99
ancient temple. The God Chennakeseva Swami em-
bedded on two feet rocky pedestal, always appears to
us in endless newness, shining and showering His
Blessings on His devotees. We will be spellbound and
drawn to a new world of Joy and Fulfilment on look-
ing at the Shining Face of Chennakesava Swami. His
shining black face is made brighter by the incandes-
cent light of the nearby oil lamp.
One day on a quiet afternoon, an important event
took place when Annamayya entered the temple and
sang a song with his natural flair;
Chinna chembutho neellu seekaya yudakambu
Allambu bellambu aratipandu
Tenetho magina tiyya mamidi pandu
Bangaru pidikillu panasatonalu
Sogasina yougulu sojjelu kabjalu
Chakkera mandaga lukkerallu
Ariselu simmilu doselu kallosul
Palakulelakul palapongu
(A tumbler full of water, conciana water,
Ginger, jaggery, fruit of banana,
Sweet mango-fruit ripened-black with honey,
So many handfuls of golden jack-tree carpels,
Beautiful yangis, sojjas, kajjas, sugared flour,
sugared mandagas, seasamunna-jaggery balls,
Kollasuls, rice-flour biscuits, cardamom and cream)
(The above said are South Indian eatables)
Though he was black in colour, his appearance
was bright and pure with a plait on his head and marks
of vibhudi on his forehead and red cloth upto his knees
and a small piece of cloth on his shoulder and the holy
thread hanging from his shoulder. He was carrying
fruits and specially made eatables in a copper plate
with a copper tumbler in his right hand. His song,
though irregular, was mellifluous as his voice was pure
and good to listen. After singing his usual song, he
murmured the following words as if he was speaking
to the Benign Deity: "Oh God! My dear small child
Chennakesava! Since my father is away and nobody
would feed you, I have brought my offerings for you.
Take bath as usual and accept my offerings". With these
words, as he failed to perform Abhishekham to the
Deity, (as he is too short to touch the Deity, which is
on a higher pedestal) he requested Swami to bend His
Head a little so that he could perform the Abhishekam.
Accordingly, Swami with His ever Gracious Smile
bent His Head so that Annamayya could perform the
Abhishekam and make the markings (namalu) on His
Face and Feed Him with Devotion and purity of mind.
As He Accepted Annamayya's offerings, Annamayya's
mother became furious with him for being reckless
and irresponsible in not helping his brothers in their
work and telling a lie that Swami Himself Accepted
All His Offerings. His father too, finding fault with100
101
Annamayya, beat him and gave him a cruel punish-
ment that he should go to the field and bring grass for
the cattle. Poor Annamayya! Not knowing what to do,
became deeply sad. But, even in this sorrowful mood,
whenever he thought of how the Swami accepted his
offerings made him truly joyful in his head and heart.
He is a devotee par excellence, born to Serve God. It
is sad that while others admired his sweet songs for
God, his parents and others at home were punishing
him cruelly. Even he was praying to the God of Seven
Hills, he cut his finger, as he was cutting the grass and
blood was oozing out from the wound. In that sad
moment of bitterness towards to his people at home, a
sweet song flowed out of his Iips in an unpremedi-
tated manner, eulogizing Sri Venkateswara as The Only
True God:
Taga bandhuvula tanaku, dallulunu
dandrudulunu
Vagalabettuchu tiruyuvare kaka
Migula veerula pondu melanuchu harinatma
Dagilinchaleka chintaparudanaithi
Anta hitula tanaku annalunu dammulunu
Vantu vasiki benagu vare kaka
Antaratmudu venkatadreesu goluva kitu
Santakutamula yalajadiki lonaite
(No kinsmen are they, nor mothers nor fathers,
But Lingeres me woes;
I thought they brought me bliss, ignored
Hari and bought me sorrows.
Are brothers, and younger, my well-wishers indeed!
Who bargain and gain their lot of legacy amain;
Rejecting service of Lord Venkatesa, the soul of my soul,
I was upset by the world's vanity fair).
Becoming unhappy with all his relatives, he iden-
tified all his mind and self, spirit and desire with Sri
Venkateswara and prayed to Him to fulfil his fervent
devotion to Swami. Surrendering himself, in True
Bhakti, he prayed to Swami to lead him towards Him-
self. Swami, with His Kindness for His BHAKTAS
led Annamayya towards the Seven Hills, which is ver-
ily the Abode of Eternal Joy of the rarest kind. In the
meanwhile, a procession of BHAKTAS was passing
that way before Annamayya. They were doing Bhajans
and Uttering Swami's "Govindanama" like this:
Govinda! God of Seven Hills! Venkataramana!
Govinda! Our Protector,
Govinda! Edukondalavada !
Venkataramana ! Govinda !
Aapad bandhava Govinda !
Adugadugu dandala vada Govinda !
Govinda ! Lord of Seven Hills !
The Lord who ends our trouble! Govinda !102
103
Kinsman of the needy! Govinda !
The Lord that's saluted at every forward step!
Govinda.!
Annamayya felt that procession consisted of Rishis
like Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanathkumar, Sanatsujata in
their disguised form, chanting Swami's name. In that
procession, while some were playing musical instru-
ments like Chirutalu, others were playing Mrudanga
and some were carrying lights shining on 'garuda
stambha',(post erected in a temple with bells on it)
some others were wearing yellow and saffron dress.
Some devotees in a mood of devotional frenzy were
dancing, with tinkling bells round their ankles. All in
all, all those devotees were in truly impassionate de-
votional frenzy. Annamayya forgot the injury to his
finger and (they endeared devotees themselves with
an invitingly pleasant smile towards him), finding
enough love and affection in them, he prostrated be-
fore them and in utter obedience, enquired about them
where were they going. They told him that they were
going to the Abode of Sri Venkateswara to make their
lives worthy of His Benevolence. Their lives would
become Pure and Holy. They found out from him about
the injury. Annamayya told them with great joy that
songs of Swami come out of him in a spontaneous,
unpreditated manner and his relatives, thought that he
was but a mad man and he cut his hand while cutting
the grass. While he was saying this, to his surprise, he
found that, the injured hand became normal. He, thus,
realized that they were not ordinary people, but Rishis
and Holy men. Expressing their happiness, they told
him that His name has significance as it symbolizes
the incarnation of Parabrahmas. They asked him to
follow them to Venkatachala Kshetra, so that he could
also reach the Divine Feet of Seshadri. He is the only
means of wishing our welfare, and none other. He is
closest to our mind and spirit and friend and Abode of
all our happiness.Thus, they asked to go with them to
the Abode of Seven Hills, without any further thought.
Following them obligingly, he also started chanting
with great fervour the Names of Lord Venkateswara,
as "Govinda" and followed them in the Hilly path of
Tirumala and in a spontaneous manner he sang like
this:
Vedukondama venkatagiri venkateswaruni
Aamati mokkulavade Aadidevude vadu
Thomani pallala vade durita durude || Vedu ||
Vaddi kasula vade vanaja nabhude, puttu
Goddu randraku biddela niche Govindude ||Vedu ||
Elami gorina varaliche devude vadu
Alamelmanga sri venkatadri nadhude || Vedu ||
Let's pray the Lord of woeless Hill
The Lord who cuts off hardships104
He's the First-ever God, prayed in troubles;
He's the sinless one whose plates offer eternal success;
The one with the navel-lotus, pleased with interest paid;
The one who blesses barren women with children;
The one who grants all prayed for boons;
The Lord of Woeless Hill and Alamelu Manga.
Singing along with them mellifluously, he reached
Tirupati, and he was taken care of with great affection
by Namala thatha who is the Eldest of the troupe and
inspired him with these words: "my dear son,
Annamayya! Sri Padapuri is the name of this place
and the big tower you are seeing belongs to Sri
Govindarajaswami: this place is also known as
Govindarajapatnam after Him. He is said to be the
Elder brother of Sri Venkateswara Swami, as it is lo-
cated at the Feet of Srinivasa, This place is known as
Sri Padapuri. This is Gangamma temple, Gangamma
thalli is the village Goddess. All of us should pray to
Her before entering the village. So, you should also
pray to Her for Her Kindness, so that She will remove
all the obstructions in our journey". Then, all the devo-
tees prayed to Gangamma thalli. He continued to de-
scribe the Glory of the Seven Hills in the following
words: "We find in that direction, Hills in Serpentine
curves. They are the Holy Seven Hills where Swami
has His Abode. That is one place, where all the people
go in thronging multitudes and we should also go there
105
to seek His Blessings!". They reached Alipiri on their
journey as the first step. Annamayya, appreciating
nature's bounty lost himself in enjoying the quiet se-
renity of the atmosphere and thought to himself like
this: "What a wonderful spectacle, Hills, Rills, Gar-
dens, Temples and Golden Towers! It is exactly what
my mother Lakkamamba described all these Hills in a
number of tales; the Hills are slowly curving like
snakes. It looks as if these Hills are like Adiseshu in
Vaikuntha bearing Sri Venkataramana Swami". Again,
in a mood of spontainity he sang another song, filled
with bhakti:
Lo ! behold! yon is Hari's Abode
Ten thousand Sesha's hoodspread glories
All the devotees accompanying him were also
taken into a ecstatic mood by dancing and singing
along with Annamayya, who was dancing in a Divine
Spell of Joy. He sang in praise at the Divine Feet of
Swami in Alipiri like this:
Adivo alladivo Sri Harivasamu
Padivela seshula Padagala mayamu
While he lost himself in his world of appreciation
of God's creations by worshiping Sri
Lakshminarasimha and enjoying by seeing other small
Hills like Chinna ekkudu, Pedda ekkudu, Gali
Gopuram, Muggubavi and Dova Narasimha, he was106
left behind by others who continued their journey, un-
mindful of his absence along with them. Then, a di-
vine event took place: nothing in this Universe hap-
pens without Divine intervention; this is true, in ev-
ery case. While he was thus continuing his journey,
he felt unmatched to the task ahead: he felt the pangs
of thirst and hunger and while he was trying to cross a
fairly big Hill, popularly known as 'Mokalla
Parvatham' he felt weak and tired and collapsed in
one corner, even while chanting the name of Swami
as "Govinda!" Then, he heard the quiet, Serene Voice
from somewhere: "Oh My Dear son, Annamayya! Get
up and sit right". Even as he woke up, and finding
none around him, he was still in the spell of That Di-
vine Voice as once again he heard those sweet, affec-
tionate words, Full of Tenderness and Inexpressible
Love coming from the depth of one's sentiment. He
felt that those words were uttered by his mother. In a
deeply impassioned plea, he prayed to rescue him. She
was like his mother. Then, that "Divine voice" which
is none other than the"voice" of Alamelu Manga ad-
vised him to remove his footwear (as it is not good to
climb the Divine Hills with footwear) to see Her. For,
that Tirumala Kshetra is the Holiest and Purest of all
places. All the Hills are Full of Salagramas, as Swami
Himself is a representation of Salagramas:
107
She brought to him the graceful food
That Hari and She herself had together eaten,
And fed him with its several tastes,
And consoled him as he was fully refreshed
Then a miracle presented itself before him: he
could see the scintillating presence of the Mother in-
viting him to Herself with Her Benign Smile. She
Appeared in all Her Divine Beauty like this: Her face
was shining like a Full Moon, White and round with
Black locks of hair fluttering on it, and wide eyes.
Decorated in Magnificent Ornaments, as the Red
kumkum shining on Her Forehead between the two
eyebrows like Resplendent Sun in shape and brilliance,
She had Nose stud, Ear rings, Waist chain (Vaddanam),
Diamond straps on Her two shoulders, many chains
and many Diamond- studded ornaments - Green
Bangles, Anklets, Reddish yellow (sindhurapu colour)
saree. She is none other than Adilakshmi Herself! He
was lost in deep Devotion and Admiration, beyond
words - as he looked at Her in an animated manner -
he was naturally speechless; as he looked around, he
found that they were not mere lifeless inanimate stones
and Hills but Holy Places of Divine Presence. They
are Narasimha Salagramas (a kind of sacred stone, a
species of black ammonite worshipped by the
Vaishnavas). They are Hills where Sri Vishnu is
Present. He prayed to Her with folded hands and fell108
at Her Feet. Then the Mother in Her Kind Benevo-
lence gave him Swami's prasadam, consisting of a
number of delectable eatables, made up of ghee and
other sweet and fragrant ingredients. He is so blessed
and fortunate that none other than the Mother Fed him
with Her own Hands with Fondling love in Small
Morsels. Naturally he forgot his own mother
Lakkamamba as she led him towards the Holy
Tirumala Kshetra, the Abode of God of Gods,
Srinivasa.
Then, Annamayya like a small child, innocently
prayed to Her to tell him about Her and where does
She live like this: "Oh Mother! You told me that You
are Alamelu Mangamma and that You are the Royal
Consort. Where do You live and from where do You
bring these Prasadams?" To this innocent inquiry, the
Mother replied thus: "Oh my very dear son
Annamayya! I am the Royal Consort of Venkateswara,
who is known for His Eternal Grace and Kindness
towards All His Ardent Devotees. I am known as
VYUHALAKSHMI as I live in Swami's Bosom and
He is called Sri-nivasa because of My presence in Him.
He has descended from Sri Vaikuntha in His Incarna-
tion from Vaikuntha on to This Earth. He is the True
Benefactor to all His devotees, never failing to listen
their woes and fulfilling all their desires like
'Kalpavruksha' and 'Kamadhenu' and 'Chintamani'. As
109
We have come from Vaikuntha only for fulfilling the
desires of Our devotees, We are One and the Same,
Indivisible and Unified, Our pleasure is in eternally
fulfilling our devotees' wishes. But, you should also
know about yourself! Sri Venkateswara has Five Weap-
ons (panchayudhalu) as Sudarsana Chakra, the wheel,
Panchajanya, the sankham, Kowmuda, the Gada Mace,
as Sharanga the bow, Nandakam the sword. You are
none other than the incarnation of sword Nandaka
and hence you are a part of Our activity of Loka
kalyana. You are as eternal as Your divine representa-
tion. Therefore, be aware that you are the representa-
tion of God Himself! You have a divinely ordained
role in the welfare of humanity, that is Loka Kalyana.
As Nandaka Sword (Nandaka Khadgam), you had the
rare, divinely sanctioned fortune of being a witness to
the Acts of the Swami for Loka Kalyana, by destroy-
ing the evil and perpetuating virtue, His Noble Deeds
and His love for Humanity, as Nandaka Sword in your
earlier incarnation. In this incarnation as Annamayya,
I Ardain you to spread and popularize Swami's Di-
vine Acts and Songs (Keertanas) of Love with your
thrikarana - in your mind, heart and soul for the ap-
preciation of all people and God Himself. Your
ardained desire should be to inculcate the spirit of Sri
Venkateswara Swami in all the people; in particular,
among the Telugu people and win their appreciation.110
111
All your impassioned keertanas should be as Holy as
Vedas and should become the ultimate Truth". With
these words, the Mother Blessed him with Her Kind-
ness by sanctioning him enough strength for his mis-
sion. Fortunately, for us, this is, indeed, a great mo-
ment in his journey towards fulfilling His, attachment
to Swami since his childhood. From then onwards,
his very word became as Eternal Parabrahma, as 'Om
kara' naturally originated from his voice, it became
the very symbol of Omkara. His very first utterance is
about Alamelu Mangamma Herself. He sang with deep
devotion like this:

Venkateswara !
Good for nothing am, I born to bear hardships;
Fit for nothing am I, unblest from mother's womb,
Yet am I by Alamelumanga taken kindly;
My blissful blessing thy kindness is, O Mother!
Protect me ! Saying so I pray this Goddess
O Lord Venkateswara ! again, again, yet again.
Thou art He and He is thee: They word is His
O Alamelumanga ! He is they heart, indeed !
The life of living things all but in thy sway:
So Sages praise thy impassable spouse, O
Venkateswara!
Victory be to Mother, the Lotus-eyed!
Victory to Indira ! Victory to Alamelumanga!
Victory! Victory ! shout I: Victory ! Victory
Heaven's Goddesses echo, saluting thy spouse,
Venkateswara!112
113
He complied a sathaka consisting of 100 poems
to express his bhakti with a deep fervour as AASUVU.
Alamelu Manga blessing him praised his efforts in
worshiping Swami and wanted him to continue to
serve Him with bhakthi and in enlightening the world
about His Magnificence and Divinity. She showed the
Divinely Bright and Shining and Marvellous Hills of
Sri Venkateswara and told him like this: "I want you
to visit there and serve Tirumalagirivasa and make
others also blessed by making them listen to your songs
on Him. He reached the Abode of the Swami by sing-
ing joyfully songs in His Praise. This is not only a
truly Blissful Moment in Annamayya's life, but also
in the world of Telugu poetry. Telugu people are
blessed by his evocation of Swami's Greatness and
Divine Bliss:

Before our eyes is Vaikuntha on this hill;
Miracles heaped up on this Tirumala hill,
This Hill is shaped with stones as Vedas,
Virtues heaping up and flowing all around.
This hill does edge on worlds like Brahma's;
This hill is Seshadri, the abode of lakshmi's Lord.
This hill is where all gods in animal forms wander;
This hill is shaped of oceans risen to heights.
This hill is whereon hermits stand like trees;
This tall hill is but Anjanadri of yore.
This hill is stored up boons that grow;
This hill is auspicious to Lakshmi's Lord.
The caves of this hill are filled with reassures;
This hill of plenty is here that suffering ends.
CHAPTER-24
ALAMELU MANGA GIVING WITNESS
Let us know a real life incident which took place
in the most joyous and Holy Abode of Padmavathi. In
the ancient times, in the Andhra desha, there were114
many people belonging to many cultures and profes-
sions, leading a happy life by practising noble values
with mutual respect and affection for each other.
Among them, one such caste of people were weavers,
who belonged to two sects, namely Padmasali and
Jandra. At the beginning, they were only one caste,
but in course of time, while some people were drawn
towards Vaishnavism, others worshipped Lord Siva.
Padmasalis followed Vaishnavism, while Jandravaru
followed Saivism. Unfortunately, because of that dif-
ference in their religious interests, animosities arose
between them; as a result, Padmasalis belonged to
Kudi Kulam, Jandras (Devangas) belonged to Edama
Kulam. Bhavanarishi became the main deity for
Padmasalis while for the people of the Jandra sect,
Pancha Maharshi was their main deity. Now, let us
know the legendary tale of how the dispute between
them was resolved by Chinnanna, Annamacharya's
grandson.
Brigu Maharshi, one of the offspring of Lord
Brahma was also known as one of Nava Brahmas. He
married Khyathi, the daughter of Dakshaprajapathi and
had two sons called Dhata and Vidhata and daughter
called, Lakshmidevi. Dhata gave birth to yogi called
Mrukandudu. Markandeya, the son of this
Mrukandudu was bachelor, greatly devoted to the pu-
rity of mind and life. While this Markandeya was per-
115
forming the Holy Ritual of Fire, two noble persons
called Pancha Maharshi and Bhavana Maharshi rose
from the fire pit (Homagundam). The people of Jandra
sect belonged to the kin of Pancha Maharshi. Bhavana
Maharshi marrying Bhadravathi, the daughter of Sun
God got hundred sons, who became famous by pro-
ducing clothes for all the Gods and asuras and hu-
manity; they belonged to the mother-in-law's side of
Lord Srihari and the maternal side of Lakshmidevi.
While they were leading a happy life in mutual coop-
eration, and following same profession, unfortunately,
differences arose in course of time and they became
almost totally divided due to the sectarian religious
interests each of them followed. These people lived
in places like Tirupati, Thiruchanur, Yogi mallavaram,
Narayanavanam, besides some other places. New dif-
ferences cropped up during the 16th century, around
the year 1541. Their differences were due to the fact
that each of these two sects (Padmasali and Jandra)
believed that Sri Mahalakshmi belonged to their par-
ticular sect and it became an insurmountable issue be-
tween them. They decided to solve that problem ami-
cably in the presence of elderly and knowledgeable
people. They sought the help of one famous man called
Tallapaka China Vengalanadhudu, who was the grand-
son of Tallapaka Annamacharya. He was also known
as Chinnanna. Thus, he agreed to solve their problem,116
117
they entrusted this job to him to deliver justice to them
to their satisfaction, as they had full faith in his ca-
pacities for correct judgment.
Chinnanna dwipada keragunu
Pannuga bedatirumalayya padamuna kerugun
Minnandi morase sarasim
Ganna kavitvambu padya gadya srenin
Chinnanna, a great devotee of Swami at Tirumala
for generations together with Trikarana was a famous
member who belonged to the family of poets of
Tallapaka. He enthralled with his poetic genius on
sections of the society, the ignorant,as well as, the wise,
alike. It is believed that since his childhood, he was
fortunate of being fed by Alamelu Manga. As he was
thus breast fed by Her, he got strength in his physical
and imaginative self. Being inspired by Her, he wrote
mellifluous poetry and kavyas, such as Ashtamahishi
Kalyanam, Paramayogi Vilasam and Usha Kalyanam;
besides these, he also wrote couplets on the life of
Annamacharya, and the life of his father,
Pedathirumalayya and his own life. Because of his
eternal popularity of his poetic genius and its ability
to appeal to all classes of people, he commanded a lot
of respect and deep devotion of people and most im-
portant, it is believed that he would talk to Alamelu
Mangamma. When he prayed to Her with devotion,
She responded to his call with Her benign smile and
took him into Her fold and fondled him with Mater-
nal Affection. As She showed Her Maternal love and
affection to him, he was playful in Her moods with
Her. As She breast fed him, he would play around with
Her as an infant child and cared Her gently with his
tender hands. She also protected him at all times with
great care and loving concern. His reputation grew
and many things about his pure devotion and associa-
tion with Alamelu Manga became a popular legend.
As he in himself became an institution of justice and
epitome of spiritual wisdom and a preceptor, unparal-
leled in his gnana and capacity for instructing others,
both the sects, the Padmasalis and the Jandras rightly
chose him to deliver justice concerning the question,
to which sect does Sri Mahalakshmi belong. Thus, they
approached him with offerings of flowers and fruits
in golden plate and prayed to him to solve their prob-
lem. They explained their problem in an explicit man-
ner and he agreed to do justice to them. The place and
time of his judgement were also decided. It was to be
on the full moon day (Poornima) of the year
Shubhakritha and the month of Karthik at eleven in
the morning in the auspicious time of Chandrahara. It
was the divine moment of Her intervention that people
remembered and celebrated with unimaginable won-
der and deep reverence. It was on Thursday, October118
23, 1541, the Holy Place and the seat of justice on
that day was in the front yard of the Temple of Alamelu
Manga. Let us now know how at that Holiest of mo-
ments that Alamelu Manga Herself gave witness to
the fact that She belongs to the sect of the Padmasalis,
in the presence of Chinnanna. It was a moment of great
marvel and wonder and awe that the Goddess Herself
became a witness.
ALAMELUMANGA PATNAM
It was a small though beautiful place, made el-
egant by a water tank, with water in it shining like a
mirror. It was indeed a truly beautiful sight, feast to
the eyes, to see Lotus Flowers blooming in it. There-
fore, it is called 'a pond of Lotus' by illiterate people,
while learned people praising the wonderful spectacle,
called it 'Padmasarovara', from which Alamelu Manga
originated.
To describe its prepondent beauty- as the black
bees were humming with their beautiful sound, the
shadows of the huge ficus trees were reflected in it
shining, distilled water, parrots and cukoo birds were
singing with their soul - filling chirping sounds, there
were the homes of Sri Vaishnava pandits and other
preceptors surrounding the Pond. Behind these homes,
people of other communities like Vysya, Padmasali
119
and Jandra, Telaga, besides other communities lived
there. On the eastern side of the pond, there is the
temple of Sun God, while on the Western side, there
is the Temple of Suryanarayana Swami, whose Deity
was supposedly installed by Lord Srinivasa Himself.
Hence, that shrine was also called Bhaskara kshetra.
It was there, in that place that, Sri Venkateswara made
Penance for 12 years for the sake of Sri Mahalakshmi,
who deserted Him and came to This Earth in a huff.
As Sri Mahalakshmi Appeared in a Thousand Petalled
Golden Lotus, She is known as Padmavathi and the
Pond is known as Padmasarovara. On the southern
side of this temple of the Sun God and the south-east-
ern side of the beautiful pond, a temple is Shining in
All Glitter and Beauty, that is the Temple of Sri
Padmavathi. She gives Her darshan to Her devotees
in the posture of "ARCHAMURTHI", facing east-
wards in This Temple. She always sanctions the de-
sires of Her devotees. On the southern side adjacent
to Her Temple, there is the Temple of Sri Krishna and
Balarama. The devotees continuously throng Her
Temple. While some devotees visit Her Temple be-
fore going to Tirumala for His Darshan and Benedic-
tion, others visit This Temple, following their visit to
Tirumala. Some devotees making This Place their
homes, worship Her. Always, the Temple is full of busy
activity.120
Located on the banks of the Swarnamukhi river,
it is known as Tiruchanur or it is called as Alamelu
Manga Patnam. As Suka Maharshi built his Ashram,
there it was known as Sri Sukapuram and in course of
time it came to be known as Tiruchanur. It is called
Chiruthanoor by illetrate people. All the devotees chant
their prayers in the following manner with fervour and
profound sentiment and purity of mind: "Oh Goddess,
Mother of the Universe! Alamelu Mangamma! You
are the Royal Consort of Srinivasa and all the
Thrimurthis chant Your Holy Name. We worship You
here as the ARCHAMURTHI! You are also the
VYUHALAKSHMI of Sri Venkateswara! As we pray
to Him, we pray to You to carry our prayers and de-
sires to Him. We pray to You to make Him fulfil our
desires". Thus, accordingly, Alamelu Mangamma, the
Embodiment of KARUNA, after first listening to the
prayers of Her devotees, carries them to Him as She is
present in His Bosom as ARCHAMURTHI. She also
makes Him fulfil their desires. She sees that He fulfils
all their prayers and wishes. Thus, She makes the de-
votion of His bhaktas increase for ever. She makes
Him fulfil all their desires and wants. She Blesses the
barren couple with children and Wealth for the poor
people; whatever Her ardent devotees pray for, She
gives them in Plentitude. She sanctions them good
thoughts and noble actions. Sri Venkateswara is also
121
anguished for Her Kindness. He can fulfil the prayers
of the devotees with Her Abundant Kindness. So, to
seek Her kindness, He performed Penance for twelve
years in Tiruchanur and finally when She sanctioned
Her Grace, He became a fulfilled self. She Blesses all
the devotees, alike, unmindful of their virtues or defi-
ciencies. As Her love is Universal to any devotee, who-
ever prays with true bhakti. She is praised as "Affec-
tion is Her Shining Divinity" (Vathsalyadi
Gunojwalam). Deeply felt by His Penance, She even
forgot Her anger in leaving Vaikuntha, such is Her
Noble Heart! She took birth in This World as
Padmavathi to fulfil His desire by taking Her Avatara
in Tiruchanur. She is present as VYUHALAKSHMI
in the Lotus Bosom of Swami in Enshrining the val-
ues of "Loka Kalyana" in This World.
It was on That Day, a Miracle was going to take
place in the Holy Temple of Sri Padmavathi. The at-
mosphere was agog with activity. All around in the
Temple and in Padmasarovara, the whole place was
Shining with Divinely Lit Brilliance. All the people's
minds were filled with expectation and anticipation
of a Celestial Event, unknown and unheard of in hu-
man history, that is the Goddess Herself would give
witness to the dispute! Whatever may be Her Judge-
ment, listening to Her Divine Voice is a blessed expe-
rience for everybody. It is Mother's Voice. As all the122
streets, and spaces were overcrowded, it was like
busily plying, honeybees, restlessly disturbed, as their
beehives were destroyed, the most learned people like
Vaishnavacharya, Jeeyars,Vedic scholors, yogis,
sadhus and holy men and young and old, alike, priests,
servants - all are waiting with anticipation to listen to
Her Divine Voice. All of them - rich and poor, people
from all the social sections, including Padmasalis and
Jandras reached that Holiest Place! The minds of all
those people were filled with a profound sense of
wonder and curiosity. All the bhaktas wanted to see
Her and listen to Her Eternal Voice! On That Day, the
Deity was Specially made up All Shining and Glitter-
ing in all too Shining Brilliance. Decorated with the
Glittering Crown, radiant with Studded Diamonds, She
is giving Her Benevolent Presence. All the devotees
were spell bound and are seeking Her Blessings. Her
Arms were also Shining with Navaratnas. With im-
pressive kumkum on Her Forehead, She is our First
Mother.
All Her devotees were filled with inexpressible
delight. Each of Her decoration on Her Divine Self
symbolized the joy of Her devotees! Each of the par-
ticle of the God symbolized the future prosperity and
fulfilment. The Emanating light of Her Shining Orna-
ment is a Pathfinder. All the devotees were invoking
Her Greatness in this manner: "Oh Mother of the Uni-
123
verse! You are residing in the Bosom of Sri
Mahavishnu; the destroyer of asuras, Madhukytabha.
Oh! The Dearest Companion to Venkateswara! Oh
Mahalakshmi! Let all the best things befall on You!
With Your Darshan, all our lives become fulfilled in
this world and elsewhere. The forecourt of the Temple
was filled with the feeling of Holiness on that memo-
rable occasion, as where all the people were waiting
to listen to Her Judgement. A replica of Her Deity
(UTSAVAMURTI) in the Golden Palanquin was kept
on a pedestal. She was Bedecked in crimson saree with
the spreading of all the Fragrance all around. Garlands
with New Flowers and Shining golden Ornaments
made Her Appear even much Brightly. All the priests
were chanting the mantras with devotion invoking Her
Blessings. Also, the chantings of Vedic Mantras along
with the mellifluous songs of the bhajantris made the
atmosphere Pious and welcome to the occasion.
In the midst of the forecourt, a noble man was
seated facing the northern side. His hands were shin-
ing with bands and bedecked with diamonds; there
were Makarakundalalu in his ears, soft silk turban was
adorning his head. Though he appeared to be black in
complexion, his face was radiating with a rare divine
splendor. Dignified and solemn on the occasion, he
was none other than Tallapaka Tiruvengalanadhudu,
who was also known as Chinnanna. His mind was124
filled with a transcendintedly quiet mood! All the
people were whispering to themselves about the great-
ness: he would make Alamelu Mangamma give wit-
ness, he is fed by the Holy Mother in his childhood.
Even his mere utterance made Her give Her blessings.
All the people were paying their respects to him as he
gave his blessings to them. Even as he appeared to be
blessing people, he was looking deeply inwards, in-
voking Her Divine Blessings. The two sects of
Padmasalis and Jandras were seated in front of
Chinnanna, joyfully waiting in anticipation to listen
to Her Judgement. In that supremely surcharged mo-
ment, filled with rare devotion and divine fervour,
exactly at around Eleven o' clock in the afternoon on
Thursday, on Karthika Purnima, the Divine Event
Truly occurred. A Thundering Sound of Bells pierced
the silence from the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple.
It was like the sound of the temple bells rung by the
priests at the time of rituals. That thunderous sound,
was however, Unique and could not be heard at all
again! The priests were offering naivedyas and light-
ing camphor to the Supreme Deity and Universal
Mother and showing them to all the devotees who were
in quiet anticipation of some Celestial event. There
was the Harati and the devotees were chanting the
names of Govinda with a crescendo and accepted
prasadam with devotion. The Temple forecourt was
125
reverberating with the chanting of the names of
"Lakshmi Venkata Ramana Govinda Govinda". The
elders of the Padmasali sect as well as Jandra sect,
after prostrating and offering their respects to
Chinnanna spoke to him like this; "You are a blessed
person! You belong to the family of Annamacharya
with the spark of Nandaka Khadga. You are his much
revered grandson and you are also Blessed with the
Divine Grace of Alamelu Manga, like him. You are
Blessed being fed by Her and your word will be fol-
lowed by Swami and Alamelu Manga. In particular,
Padmavathi will gladly accept whatever you tell Her;
your utterance and Her divine sanctity of your prayer
are inalienable! Your blessings are none other than
Mother's Blessings! So, we pray to you to seek for
our sake, Her Judgement in resolving our dispute. We
belong to the weaving community. It is mentioned in
Puranas that Sri Mahalakshmi was born in our two
sects. She is our sister-in-law. We are living in
Narayanavanam, Tiruchanur, besides some other
places. We are offering saree woven by us to Sri
Mahalakshmi. However, as we were offering the saree
over the years, there was a dispute between our two
sects, who should offer the saree first to Her. There-
fore, we pray to you, Learned Chinnanna, Oh! to de-
cide to which sect does She truly belong! We swear
by your decision and we offer the saree to Her in all126
the Holy Temples at many places and offer other gifts,
due to Her from Her maternal side. So, we believe
that you can make Her utter the truth to which sect
does She belong! This is our humble prayer to you!
So, be kind to us in resolving this problem between
our two sects. There was a mood of rich and profound
silence---the air was filled with anticipation of some
Celestal event. Prostrating before the Universal
Mother and praying to Her with pure devotion, he
advised the devotees like this; "Today is the Holiest
and Memorable day. It is a Day of Great Rejoicement
and fulfilment for all of us in Tiruchanur. We are here
now to listen to Her Celestial Words. So, all of you
pray to Her in solemnity and silence and recount the
Divinely Supreme Deity before your eyes! Let good
things befall on all of us!" Then, doing a dhyana of
Her, he sang a "sankeertana" of Annamacharya, about
Alamelu Mangamma: He also prayed Her like this:
"Oh Alamelu Manga! Your blemishless presence
makes Swami's eyes sparkling with Celestial Bright-
ness and being present in His Bosom as
"VYUHALAKSHMI", You are protecting all Your
devotees. With Your quiet Presence and Showing Love
and Affection to Him, You have made Him Your Be-
loved Companion, forever. With Your words of Love,
You are living in His Bosom like a Royal Consort".
He also invoked His blessings.
127
Praising Their qualities are always protecting the
devotees, who pray to Them with devotion, he sang
another Annamacharya's poem: Oh Universal Mother!
You and Srinivasa are inalienable self. Your utterances
are nothing but His utterances. All the Rishis and noble
men seek Your KARUNA
And
You gave us the pleasure and power of pure utter-
ance. You are always present in my mind and in every
word I utter!
And
Oh Mother! You have fed me with Your milk in
my childhood!
Oh Universal Mother! You Know Everything. You
are a Sarvagna. Accept me with all the good and bad
in my utterances, Show Kindness on me. I am plead-
ing with You for an answer to the problem of these
devotees, belonging to the Padmasali and Jandra sects.
They spend all their lives only in Your service. They
are weavers and with their noble service, they are do-
ing a lot of good to society. But, as they are living
happily by Your KARUNA, a dispute arose between
them: that both of them are claiming that You belong
to their sect and that each of them want to offer their
devoutly woven saree, besides fruits and other pre-
cious things to You first. As a result, animosity and128
hatred developed between them. Hence, they are pray-
ing to You to resolve their problem". Oh Our Beloved
Mother! You know that their Bhakti towards You is
great. They have come to me to settle their dispute.
So, I pray to You, to let us know to which sect You
belong from Your maternal side and from whom would
You desire to accept the first offerings". With these
words of devotion to the Mother, Chinnanna went into
dhyana as the atmosphere was filled with expectant
silence of a Celestial event. After a few moments of
hope and expectation in people's minds, a Melliflu-
ous Voice pierced through darkness; it was resonating
with rare energy everywhere in Tiruchanur. As the
voice, which was vibrating with Supreme Power and
energy came to an end, A Transcendental Light fol-
lowed. As people were awaiting for the final word of
the Mother in rapt attention, their minds were filled
with rapture, when they heard the following words of
the Mother:
"I belong to the Padmasali sect on My Maternal
side; hence, in all My Shrines and special occasions
and festivals, the people of Padmasali sect should first
perform all the rituals and Holy practices and tradi-
tional customs, to Me and the people of the Jandra
sect are not involved in this. They can, however, fol-
low all the rituals and customs after the performance
of Padmasalis".
129
All the people listened to these Unique Celestial
Voices in rapture, as Her words reverberated all over.
Her words were like the Mantras. And everbody won-
dered if such things really happen in Kaliyuga. All in
all, it was a divinely sanctioned "moment"! With the
rapturous chanting of "Govinda namas", the mood be-
came fervently Devotional. From then onwards, on
Mother's Karthika Brahmotsavams, the Padmasalis
offer the saree, woven by them. Also, in Narayanavana
Brahmotsavam and at the time of Dhwajarohana, they
follow these ritual and traditional customs. As they
listened to Her voice, chanting Her Names, they dis-
persed after showing their reverence to Chinnanna.
PADA KANUKA SASANAM
Afterwards, out of great reverence and profound
bhakti and immense gratitude, the devotees of the
Padmasali sect presented ten thousand varahas at His
feet along with a 'danasasanam'. In addition, they also
took a Holy oath that every year they would give one
Golden coin from each weaving loom to Chinnanna
for performing all the Dharmic programmes. As they
wrote this oath in this sasanam, this is known as
‘Padakanuka sasanam’ and this sasanam is written on
two copper plates. The first plate, which is of 11 ½
inches in length and 8 inches in width shows the pic-
ture of Srivenkateswara's Original Deity in the first130
131
page; the second page describes the sasana. The sec-
ond plate, which is of 11½ inches in length and 8 1/16
inches of width, on its first page describes the devel-
opments after the sasana in the first plate, while upto
half of the second page describes the Sasana and the
picture of Alamelu Manga. Each of these plates have
a thickness of 1/16 inches. We can find both these plates
in T.T.D. Museum.descendants of Tallapaka poets have received All the
Bessings of Sri Hari and Alamelu Manga and they
inturn have distributed it through their poetry. The
Telugu people are indebted to Tallapaka poets.
Chinnanna by adding ten thousand varahas to the
ten thousand varahas presented to him by Padmasali
and with these twenty thousand varahas, he bought a
mine of the slate rock called Allagattu, which is on
the eastern side of Chandragiri and donated it to the
nation. He wrote in the following manner in the same
Sasana; "whoever wants to build a temple by utilizing
the stone from this mine, half of the Punya (Dharma)
belongs to Chinnanna, while one fourth of it belongs
to the donors of the temple and the remaining to the
Padmasalis". In this manner, a great real life legend
comes to an end.Now, let us know the story of another great devo-
tee, whose life is an example of a true "bhakti". She is
Tarigonda Vengamamba. Her story is a saga of pure
and selfless devotion, with total surrender to Sri
Venkateswara. She lived about 250 years ago. She
spent all her life in worshiping Him by presenting
garlands, made up of bacillus (tulasimalalu) and sing
His songs in great joy. Unmindful of the world around
Her, she had only one awareness that is to continu-
ously sing Sankeertanas with Trikarana.
In this legend of great marvel and bhakti, we come
to realize that Chinnanna is gifted with a divine po-
etic inspiration by virtue of Alamelu Manga feeding
him in his childhood. Sri Venkateswara also Blessed
him with Makarakundala. Thus, while Annamayya was
Blessed by Alamelu Manga, Chinnanna was also
blessed by Her. It is, indeed, our good fortune that the
CHAPTER-25
VYUHALAKSHMI'S KINDNESS TO
VENGAMAMBA
She lived in a small village called Tarigonda, near
Vayalpadu in Chittoor District. Born to Kanala
Krishnayya and Mangamma with the blessings of Sri
Venkateswara, she was named as Venkatamma and in
course of time, she came to be known as Venkamma.
Since her childhood, she spent all her time in perform-
ing bhajans in His name. As she involved herself in
such with deeply religious activities since her child-
hood, her parents wondered whether she was, indeed132
in a true state of bhakti or was it madness and they
decided that, perhaps, her marriage could make her
"sane". However, she refused to be married to a hu-
man self, as she believed that none other than Lord
Venkateswara was her divinely chosen companion. Fi-
nally, in any case, she was forcibly married, very much
against her will, to Injeti Venkatachalapathi, who be-
longed to the neighbouring village. As destiny will
set, unfortunately her husband passed away even be-
fore she set out for her married life. But, unmindful of
this, she continued to wear flowers and bangles and
telling everybody that her husband was Lord
Venkateswara Himself. Also, at that time, she took a
Upadesa from her preceptor, called Rupavatara
Subramanyam and from then onwards, she was in con-
stant 'dhyana' of Sri Venkateswara. The people of that
village, did not like her behaviour and gave her enough
trouble, with their pungent words. Unable to bear their
vitriolic utterances she had to leave for the shrine of
Tirumala, leaving behind her parents in the village.
HER LIFE IN TIRUMALA
Her life in Tirumala is a saga of true devotion.
Unmindful of many difficulties of lack of shelter and
enough food to eat, she continued to live in her world
of bhakti for the Swami. She was biding her life by
feeding herself with Swami's prasadam given by the
133
priests and taking shelter under the trees or in small
temples. Swami deeply moved by her fervent devo-
tion, used to talk to her and listen to her songs in rap-
ture and sometimes dance to them. Swami was lov-
ingly looking forward to see her; He accepted with
love her offerings of flowers or fruits. But, in any case,
she never told Swami of her difficulties. However, fi-
nally, unable to bear her sufferings, any longer, she
prayed to Swami to rescue her from that suffering like
this:
"Oh Swami Lord of the Seven Hills! Venkata
Ramana! You are the only being related to me! To
whom can I express my sorrows, except You? So, I
pray to You to understand my sorrowful condition!
Here, there is no shelter for me to protect myself from
sun and rain. I am taking shelter only under trees or a
small temple, suffering in cold and rain. How can I
fulfil my deepest desire of praying to You? I will never
leave You, whatever my difficulties may be! Hence,
Swami! Lord of the Universe! I pray You to provide
me shelter for ever to live at Your Holiest of Pres-
ence; also provide me facilities for getting some food.
I will no longer pray to You for anything more". She
prayed to Him with great fervour and deep feeling.
Even while she was telling those words, she naped
and then went into deep sleep, in which she had
Swami's Darshan. It was a moment of Divine vision.134
She had His Darshan in all His Glory. She envisioned
Swami like this; melodiously tinkling anklets on His
Golden Feet; Shining Golden cloth round His loin with
the golden Nandaka Khadgam hanging from it; Thread
round His waist; the right hand assuring His grace;
(varada hastham) left side on His waist (Kati
Hastham); Sankha Chakralu on His other hands! Shin-
ing Mani Kousthubham on His Chest; golden chains
on His neck, Vyuhalakshmi brilliantly shining in His
Bosom! His Forehead, with mark (namam) of cam-
phor! Golden Crown Studded with Diamonds. He had
All Benign Smile with Golden Earlobes. She is, in-
deed, blessed to have His Darshan. Blessing Her,
Swami, who is known for His Love and Affection for
His devotees, spoke to Her like this: I am happy to
know that you want to live to pray to Me in this
Seshachala Shrine! You are asking for shelter and some
food to eat. But, I want to tell you one thing: I may be
the Lord of the Seven Hills. All these Seven Hills do
belong to Me. There is no doubt. Sri Mahalakshmi is
present in My Bosom as VYUHALAKSHMI. She is
not only My Royal Consort, but also the Mother of
the Universe. Only because of Her I am known as the
God in this Kaliyuga (KALAU VENKATA
NAYAKAHA), Granting prayers of all My devotees.
My kind deeds to My devotees are known to them
only because of fear. Hence, I want you to pray to Her
135
for fulfilling Your desires". With those words, her
dream lapsed. She found herself in a deep trance after
His Darshan. It is, indeed, a Marvel. She went wor-
shiping Alamelu Manga, the Universal Mother in this
manner: "Oh Mahalakshmi! the Most Beloved of
Vishnu Bhagavan! Your Transcendental Presence is
found in all the living and non-living things, alike.
Your Divinity is enshrined in all things! You are the
Originator of all knowledge! I pray to You in all de-
votion to make me see Your Benovolent Presence! You
are His Royal Consort and You sanction all our de-
sires! You are the source of all creation! You drive
away all our fears! You are the Embodiment of all the
Wealth in This world. Always, Your Dignity and
Ardour are flawless. I pray to You to provide me Your
Darshan". She continued her prayer to the Most Be-
nevolent Mother in this manner: "Oh Mahalakshmi!
Everybody from the most ordinary people like me to
Swami crave for Your Divya Darshan and for Your
Grace! Even Swami craved for Your Divya Darshan
not for one day or two days but for 10 years in
Kolhapur and afterwards for 12 years near
Padmasarovaram and prayed to You to win Your Grace.
He then became Srinivasa, with Your Presence in His
Bosom, and sanctioning All Wealth and Happiness to
the devotees. I am praying to You, Oh Mother! as I am
ordained by Swami. As You are Granting Infinite Grace136
137
to the devotees, we are all praying to You to pardon
our sins and grant our prayers. Swami and You are
one and the same, in helping the devotees in their dif-
ficulties. You are the Deity of Kaliyuga and none can
equal in Your Benevolence! Whatever Praise we give
to You is inadequate. Hence, I pray to You to fulfil my
desire in providing permanent shelter to me on this
Venkatachala, the Holiest of Shrines. She praised Her
in this Sankirtana:
May I stay here ? Mother !
Do you take care of me ? Alamelumanga !
I don't know why, but thy lord told me
To beg permission of thee and stay here:
Accept me with kind of compassion : I come
To stay desirous of soul's liberation.
I can't across countries roam;
I can't with dualists argue much;
I can 't adore the kings of kingdoms:
I can't amass wealth for giving alms.
I can't my body tire; hardships
I can't bear; what can I do?
I can't stand among assemblies of men;
Here I shall stay doing thy marvellous will.
Shall I reach for the prop seshachala's Lord
Who is but Narasimha of Tarigonda?
Kindly speak out: I meditate upon
Thy felt, the ultimate heaven of all.
(This song was sung extempore by Tarigonda
Vengamma herself)
With these words of Vengamamba, the Universal
Mother showered Her Blessings and granted her
prayers and gave her Darshan. As Alamelu and Swami
are one and the same in protecting the devotees,
Alamelu Manga takes the side of the devotees to make
Swami accept their prayers. After listening to her
prayer, Swami and Alamelu Mangamma decided to
grant her desires by providing shelter in the precincts
of the Temple itself, so that she can devote all her life
in Their dhyana. Swami asked Atmaram Das, His per-
sonal devotee in his dream to look after the needs of
Vengamamba for shelter and succour. This Atmaram
is one of the devotees of Hathiram Bavaji, who played
dice with Swami. Hathiram Bavaji himself was one
of the Swami's great devotees. Being greatly pleased
with Swami's words, Atmaram Das met Vengamamba
and told her most obediently like this: "Oh devoted
mother, Lord ordained me to look after you by pro-
viding shelter and I request you to kindly accept my
service to make me happy. You can devote all your
life in His dhyana". Thus, a small thatched hut was
built on the north-eastern side of the temple in the
path of Mahapradakshina, beside the Lord's rock138
chariot. From then onwards, she is provided with ma-
terial for preparing food by Vakuladevi. This episode
took place in 1843 - 1933 during the reign of Mahants.
Thus, she spent the rest of her life in worshiping
Swami and entered into Samadhi, by seeking Unifi-
cation with the Almighty. She used to spend all her
time in presenting garlands made up of bacillus in the
morning and involving herself in her literary activity
in the afternoon, while in the evening, she offered
Karpura Neerajanam in the evening. She spent the
night in satsang with Swami and His dhyana. Swami
was Greatly Happy to receive the service called
Muthyala Harathi (which is an aarathi of camphor).
She grew a flower garden to make the garlands and
offer them to Him. She spent her time in His dhyana
or writing literary works of great value and worth. It
is a belief among people that Swami would spend His
time in listening to her words, after Ekanta seva. She
also excelled herself as a poet. She wrote NRUSIMHA
SATHAKAM, NARASIMHA VILASA KATHA,
RAJAYOGA SARAMRUTHAM, BALAKRISHNA
NATAKAM,SRIKRISHNA MANJARI,RUKMINI
NATAKAM, GOPI NATAKAMASTANGAYOGA
SARAM, MUKTIKANTHA VILASAM, VENKATACHALA
MAHATMYAM, DWIPADA BHAGAVATAM, VASISTA
RAMAYANAM, RAMA PARINAYAM, JALAKREEDA
VILASAM, VISHNU PARIJATHAM, SIVANATAKAM, besides
139
many other works of great profundity and pure devo-
tion. In her innumerable keertanas and songs in a
spantaneous manner, she always believed that Lord
and Sri Narasimha swami are inalianable and they are
one and the same. Thus, she led a fruitful life of a
great devotee dedicating herself to His service, and
entered into a state of Samadhi in her living self on
Sravana Suddha Navami in the year 1817. It is a wide-
spread belief that from then onwards, she would enter
the Temple through the underground tunnel to offer
her Karpura Harathi (aarthi of camphor) to Swami
every night after His Ekanta seva. Now also, we can
see Samadhi in Tirumala on the northern side of the
Temple. We can also find that Karpura aarthi is of-
fered everday to Swami after the Ekanta seva as this
is the last service to Him.
MUTHYALA HARATHI
Ekanta seva is performed as the last service to
Swami. Ekanta seva means the service to Put Him to
Sleep. A Deity called Manavallappa Perumal (mean-
ing "always a bridegroom") is kept on the Golden Cot,
hung with silver chains. At that time, the arathi called
Muthyala Harathi of Tarigonda Vengamamba is of-
fered to Him. Afterwards, the same harathi is given to
Bhoga Srinivasamurthi. As Swami is Shining and
Swinging in Divine Brightness in the Golden Cot, a140
141
quiet song of rare mellifluence is sung by the family
members of Tallapaka Annamacharya using the
DANDA. They sing the song "Jo Achyuthananda, jojo
Mukunda! Rave Parmananda Ramagovinda" to put
Swami to Sleep. Thus, while receiving harathi of
Tarigonda Vengamamba on one side and listening to
the mellifluous song of Tallapaka Annamacharya, on
the other side, He will resume His Yoganidra (Eternal
Sleep)-and this scene one has to see for oneself its
splendor and magnificence, as any amount of words
fail to give full expression to it. Like this, the karpura
harathi (aarthi of camphor) is offered to Swami and
VYUHALAKSHMI in His Bosom every day. Swami
is always Shining in His Celestial light as the devo-
tees go into rapture and Swami gives His Blessings to
them. Now let us listen to one of the songs of Mangala
Harathi of Tarigonda Vengamamba to Swami and His
Royal Consort:

on Panchameetheertham, Pasupu (Turmeric) and
kumkuma offered to Her are given to Tiruchanur
Padmavathi, as 'Saare'.The Holy Shrine of Kolhapur is in Maharastra. It
was Here that Swami went on a Penance for 12 years
for getting Sri Mahalakshmi's Grace, as she left
Srivaikunta in a huff. This Shrine is one of the Eigh-
teen Seats of Worship (Sakthi Peethalu). Here, She is
worshipped in Holy processions and festivals. Every
year on the Pournami of Chaitramasa, the festival of
Chariot (Radhotsavam) takes place with Great Aplomb
and Felicity. Also, on Vaisakha Suddha Triteeya, i.e.,

during Navarathri festivals, processions take place in
a grand manner on Durgashtami day, She appers in all
Her Grandeur and Beauty with the offerings of saree
sent from T.T.D. Every year Surya Kiranotsavam is
celebrated twice every year on January 31st, Febru-
ary 1st and 2nd and November 9th, 10th and 11th". On
those days, on the first day during the sunset, sun's
rays fall on Her Divine Feet on the second day on Her
Bosom and on the third day on Her Golden Crown.
NARAYANA VANAM
This is the Divine Place where Swami married
Padmavathi. She is also known as Padmavalli, Pad
mini, Vedavati and Vedalakshmi. There are no festi-
vals for Her. She appears to us in all Her Splendid
Beauty as the Royal Queen. She does not go out of
Her Shrine and takes immense pleasure on the many
Glorious Festivals. Holy Rituals are performed for Her,
according to the Vaikhanasagama tradition. On Fri-
Now let us chant Her prayer:
Namam tyajethah Sritakalpavalli
Sadbhakti chintamani kamadheno150
151
Viswasya Matha rbhava suprasanna
Gruhe kalatreshu cha putravarge
"Oh Mahalakshmi, Universal Mother! You always
sanction our prayers like Kalpavriksha and
Kamadhenu and Chintamani by evoking bhakti in our
minds. Oh our dearest Mother! We pray to You to be
always with us to give happiness to all of us in this
world".
CHAPTER-27
SRI SURYANARAYANASWAMI TEMPLE
(TIRUCHANUR)
This Holy Temple in Tiruchanur is about 20 feet
towards the western side of Padmasarovaram. Main-
tained by T.T.D. the Deity of Sri Surya Bhagavan was
established by Sri Venkateswara Himself, when He
was on Penance for 12 years for the Grace of Sri
Mahalakshmi, who was at that time in the Kolhapur
temple. He heard an invisible and unbodied voice
which told Him to come to Venkatachala and make
Padmasarovaram and go on Penance for Her Grace
there. Accordingly, He established Padmasarovaram
and installed in them Golden Lotuses from Heaven to
make them always in Full Blossom. He established
Sun God. After 12 years of His untiring penance, Sri
Mahalakshmi was Born in the Thousand-Petalled
Golden Lotus as Alamelu Manga. So, this Shrine of
Sun God called Bhaskarakshetra is ancient and it has
three parts, namely forecourt, Artha Mandapam, and
Sanctum Sanctorum (Garbha Gudi).
If we look at the marble inscription on the eastern
side of frontcourt, we find the following description
of the installation of the deity of Sri Suryanarayana
Swami in the year Akshayanama, Nija Jyeshta Suddha
Navami Friday (i.e., on April 23, 1866). The new De-
ity of Sri Suryanarayana Swami was installed by
Dharmadasuji Mahanther, who was the disciple of Sri
Mahanthu Sevadasuji of Maharajasri Hathee Ramji
Math.
But, it is not clear whether the Deity installed was
the old one or the new one. After the front court of the
Temple, we come across spacious and long
Ardhamandapa, which is also used as the pathway for
Pradakshina. The devotees can worship the deity from
this Ardhamandapa; the Sanctum Sanctorum is 8 ft
long and 8 feet wide. In this Holy Sanctum Sanctorum,
we can see Swami's marvelous Deity, Swami appears
to us with lotus flowers glittering in his two arms and
golden crown on his head and gold ornaments and the
holy thread. He is seated on the lotus pedestal. The
Deity also shows Swami wearing angavastra from
waist to his feet. The feet have anklets. On the Sanc-
tum sanctorum, there is Kalasa gopuram. All the pil-152
lars and Deity make us notice its antiquity. Besides
Swami's main Deity, we can also see his Altarego
which is about 3.5 feet in height and the idol of
Bhogamurthi-these are the replicas of the main Deity
and they are used in the festivals. This temple does
not have the traditional Dhwaja Sthambham or seat of
sacrifice (balipeetham). The Daily Rituals take place
thrice a day by following the Vyakhyayana Sastra. Ev-
ery Sunday at 8 in the evening, Abhishekam is per-
formed for the Main Deity; in this Ritual, cowmilk,
curds, honey and coconut water and sandalwood pow-
der and other materials are used. After the Abhishekam,
sweet pongal is offered to Swami with devotion and
the devotees can participate in this ritual by paying
the requisite money. Besides, on the Hastha
nakshatram of every month, which is Swami's day of
incarnation, Abhishekam is performed for the altarego
and after this, this altarego is taken in a procession in
the streets of Tiruchanur in a palanquin as a village
festival. On all the Auspicious Days, such as Makara
Sankranthi, Ratha Sapthami, Abhishekhams are per-
formed for the Main Deity as well as for the Altarego.
Every year in Dhanurmasa, for a month, rituals take
place from early in the morning from 5 o' clock. Sri
Suryanarayana Swami has a very important role in the
Avatar of Lord Srinivasa, as a bridge between Lord
Srinivasa and Sri Mahalakshmi, at the time of Their
marriage. At that time, Sri Mahalakshmi was staying
153
in Kolhapur and as ordained by Swami, He brought
Her to the marriage. Also, He was present in
Tiruchanur to make the Golden Lotuses always blos-
som with his rays, as his deity was installed by Sri
Venkateswara Himself. Thus, he became responsible
for the presence of Alamelu Manga in the Thousand
Petalled Golden Lotuses in Padma Sarovaram and for
the incarnation of Padmavathi. From then onwards, it
gained great importance as the Shrine of the Sun God
(Bhaskara Kshetram). When the devotees visit this
Shrine, their pilgrimage becomes complete.
CHAPTER-28
SRI KRISHNASWAMI TEMPLE IN
TIRUCHANUR
This temple is located between Alamelu Manga
Temple and Sri Sundararajaswami temple. It is oppo-
site to the Mukhadwara of Sri Mahalakshmi Temple.
This is the ancient temple and of great value and sig-
nificance. This is known in the ancient inscriptions as
Alagiya Perumal, meaning beautiful deity. As we en-
ter the compound, we come across Sri Krishnaswami
temple and about 10 inscriptions are found in this
temple in Tirupati and Tiruchanur. The first inscrip-
tion belongs to the year 1221 of 3rd Raja Raja Chola
and the last inscription in the series belongs to the
year 1552. It is found in the inscriptions that the temple154
was built at the beginning of 12th century. Pakkeeran,
a devotee, bought a piece of land and grew crops in it
and by selling them, donated the money he got from
it. Hence a festival is held every year in his name.
Afterwards in 1467 Sthanathar ordered Vijayanagara
king Saluva Narasimharayalu that he should send but-
ter to Krishna who is Alagiya Perumal. It is also men-
tioned in the inscription that Saluva Narasimharayalu
himself donated for this temple. In 1541, it is found in
the inscription that Sattalur Srinivasa Iyangar gave
2770 narpanam as gift for use in service and for offer-
ings at the Theertha Vari Festival which was celebrated
at the end of Adi Brahmotsavam. In 1552, Ramaraju
Kodandaraju gave a donation for the offering to
Srikrishna at Paruveta. This temple, which is consid-
ered to be more ancient than Padmavathi Temple. It is
built in four parts:
The pillars on the north-eastern and south-eastern
side were built in the Chola style of sculpture, others
show the Vijayanagara style of sculpture; this is the
definite opinion of the researchers.
MAHA MANDAPAM
There are sixteen pillars. Four of pillars, in each
of the four rows of pillars, each with a height and
length and width of 24 feet on eastern, northern and
southern sides. While the pillars on the north- eastern
and south -east were built in the Chola style of sculp-
155
ture, others show the Vizayanagara style of sculpture;
this is the definite opinion of the researchers.
SNAPANA MANDAPAM
As we enter the temple after the Mahamandapa,
we have the Snapanamandapa, which is a marvelous
creation, making us believe that truly it is the Main
Entrance. It is 24 feet in length and 8.6 feet in width.
It has two rows of rock pillars, each row consisting of
four pillars. With the iron construction on the north-
ern and southern side and a wall in the eastern side,
this mandapam is believed to have been formed. It is
believed that in the past, this mandapam was part of
the main entrance (mahamandapam).
INNER TEMPLE( ANTHARALAM)
After the Snapanamandapam, we enter the inner
temple, which is 24 feet in length and 5.5 in width.
We find on the northern side towards the north-west,
the brass-made festival Deities of Sri Venugopala
Swami with His consorts, Rukmini and Sathyabhama
on a pedestal; these Deities can be found facing the
eastern side. Sri Venugopala swami is shining with
Chathurbhuja - with His Sankhu and Chakra on His
two arms above, playing the traditional flute in His
hands below. Every month, after the Abhishekam, on
the Rohini, these festive Dieties are taken on a pro-
cession in the streets of Tiruchanur. On Sri156
Krishnastami festival day, every year; after the tradi-
tional rituals of Abhishekam and Archana, they are
taken in a procession.
SANCTUM SANCTORUM
After the inner temple, we enter the Holy SANC-
TUM SANCTORUM, where we find, towards its
western side and facing eastwards, the two Deities of
Sri Krishna and Balaram on a two-feet pedestal. Lord
Sri Krishna, seated on the lotus is spreading his two
arms in a posture of assurance (VARADA
BHANGIMA). Beside Swami's Diety, the Diety of Sri
Balaram is installed; latter folded his left leg, while
spreading his right leg. He kept His left hand on his
left knee, while his right hand is kept on the-floor. It
appears as if he is in a resting posture. Both the Dei-
ties of Balaram and Sri Krishna have crowns over their
heads.
Now, we should know some stories, which are in
circulation, about them. One story is like this: during
the epic Kurukshetra war, Balaramudu, unwilling to
support either Pandavas or Kauravas, in a mood of
resignation went on a pilgrimage. After the comple-
tion of the war in 18 days, Lord Sri Krishna, going in
search of his elder brother reached the hermitage of
Sri Suka Maharshi. On the request of the Maharshi he
agreed to rest there and in that serene atmosphere went
157
into dhyana in lotus posture. Then, Balaramudu, after
completing his pilgrimage felt happy to see his younger
brother, Lord Srikrishna and he sat on the pedestal
without removing his footwear, in an expansive mood
of joy, on seeing his younger brother. Lord Krishna
told him that they were in the Holy Shrine in the Seven
Hills and requested him to stop his pilgrimage.
Balaramudu accepted this and wanted to have the
darshan of Suka Maharshi, who gave them a boon that
since they visited his ashram, they would have the
benefit of visiting all the Shrines. As a sign of their
visiting the ashram, it is believed that, the Deity was
installed in the posture of their giving a holy mes-
sage. In the Sanctum Sanctorum we also have the an-
cient brass idols of Little Krishna and Little
Lakshminarayana Swami. On top of the Sanctum
Sanctorum, the tower was built. In the four directions
of this tower, there is sculpture of the lions. On top of
this tower, Golden plaque is installed. In this temple,
rituals take place, according to Pancharathragama
Sastra. The rituals in this temple, thrice a day, take
place before the rituals in Padmavathi temple. Every
month, on Ashtami tithi, Abhishekham and other ritu-
als take place for Lord Sri Krishna and Balarama. In a
similar way, every month on Rohini Nakshatra,
Abhishekam and other rituals take place, followed by
the practice of taking the festive Deities in a proces-158
159
sion in Tiruchanur streets. Every year, on Sri Krishna
Ashtami, in Rohini Nakshatra-rituals are performed
in a grand manner. As a part of the boat festival of
Padmavathi, in Shining Lotus Pond (Padma
Sarovaram) for five days, Sri Krishnaswami's boat fes-
tival is celebrated. These festivals take place in such a
manner that they are completed by the full moon day
(pournami) of the month of Jyeshta. In this festival,
Swami along with Sri Rukmini and Satyabhama ap-
pear in all their splendid beauty.
CHAPTER-29
SRI SUNDARA RAJA SWAMI TEMPLE
This temple is in the same compound of Sri
Padmavthi Temple towards the southern side of Sri
Krishna swami temple. The Deity, facing eastwards is
installed on a pedestal of 4 feet height. Swami in this
temple is variously called Sri Sundararaja Swami and
Sri Varadaraja Swami. The Deity is also famously
known as Sri Sundararaja Swami. In 1541 inscription,
Varadaraja Swami temple festival is celebrated. In a
similar way, the Varadaraja Swami Brahmotsavams
and 'Vidayyarri' festival are also mentioned in the 1547
inscription. Since there is a mention of boat festivals
and the Adhyayanotsavam in this inscription, it is be-
lieved that this temple was built in 16th century. There
are four parts in this temple: 1. Main entrance
(Mahamandapam) (2) Fore court (Mukha mandapam)
(3) inner temple (Antaralam) : 4. Sanctum Sanctorum
(Garbhalayam). This temple is built on an elevated
rock pedestal. It has, on the upperside three parts
Padma pattika, thripattika and Galapattika. In the main
entrance (mahamandapam), three rows of four pillars
each are found; there are however only two pillars in
the first row and there are 14 pillars altogether with
Vijayanagara style of construction. There are two en-
trances from the main entrance towards inner temple
(Antaralam) and the idols of Jaya and Vijaya on either
side of the entrance of inner temple. In the inner
temple, in the Sanctum Sanctorum, there is a wall and
the entrance door is decorated. In the middle portion
of the Sanctum Sanctorum, we have Sri Sundara Raja
swami's Deity in standing posture. He has four arms:
while the upper two arms have Sudarshana Chakra
and Panchajanyam, the lower right arm is in the pos-
ture of assuring His devotees, the left arm is spread in
the lower direction. In the Sanctum Sanctorum, we
have the festive idol of Sri Sundararaja Swami, with
His consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi in the three feet high
brass idols. Facing Sri Sundara Raja Swami outside
the main entrance, we have Garuda Mandapam. In this
mandapam, we have the idol of Garutmanta in his out-
stretched wings, in the standing posture and this idol
is very ancient.160
Rituals thrice a day are performed according to
Pancharathragama sastra. Every month on
Uttarabhadra Nakshatra, which is Swami's day of in-
carnation, rituals and Abhishekam are performed, fol-
lowed by village fetilval in the evening in Tiruchanur.
Every year on Jyesta masa Pournami, for Swami's fes-
tive idols, boat festivals are performed on the second
day of the five-day boat festival of Sri Padmavathi in
the Padmasarovara. Every year in Jyesta masa, for three
days, Abhishekam and Archana are performed for this
Swami's festive idols as well as for the Main Deity.
On each carrier, every evening, on the day of incarna-
tion of Swami on Jyesta masa, Uttarabhadra Nakshatra,
in 1906, under the leadership of Mahantu Prayagadasji,
Sri Swami's Sanctum Sanctorum and degenerated
tower are renovated by installing a golden kalasa, be-
sides temple's festival of Maha Kumbhabhishekam are
performed. From then onwards, festivals take in a glo-
rious manner. In 2006, in Jyesta masa festival of
Swami's incarnation took place. Swami, shining with
His Consorts and Sankha-chakra and assuring hand
(Varada hastam), like Lord Venkateswara Himself,
always with the benign smile- one has to see for one-
self, and seek His blessings.
