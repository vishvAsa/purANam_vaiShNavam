**INTRODUCTION.**  
\_\_\_\_\_\_

 1. A few months ago, I ventured to publish a work called “Dhruva’s Penance”. I now crave leave to inflict another on the public, a similar Drama in Sanskrit with an English rendering.

 2. “Sree Krishna” is a name that conveys a magic thrill into the heart. It is a genuine pleasure to lisp in prose or verse about the great Hero of Indian pastoral literature—the cowherd boy who fascinated the maidens of Gokul and Brindavan by His Divine Form and his Divine Flute.

 3. I am not unconscious of the truth that metre alone is not poetry. No man has a right to claim a hearing who can show no originality in his utterences or writings. But the irrepressible desire to associate my thoughts with Bala Krishna overcame all scruples in the matter.

  4. The central scene of the plot is laid on the shores and sands of the Jumna, Sree Krishna sported there as a Human Boy amidst human surroundings, on a vast plain of white sand, which the flooding moonlight converted into a scene of exquisite poetry. He set up a theatre of Orpheus, where all animate and inanimate nature loved to devour the soul–stirring melody of His Flute and forgot their individuality in the bliss. The title of this book refers to this idyllic scene as “Bhoo Vaikunta” or the Earthly Paradise

 5. The tenth Skandham (Book) of Bhagavata narrates briefly the story of Sree Krishna holding the Govardhana Hill in the air for seven days, when by reason of Indra’s wrath, Brindavan was deluged by a continuous down-pour of rain. Hari Vamsa narrates the incidents at greater length.

 6. Indra is usually conceived as the Jupiter of Swarga wielding a thunderbolt and governing the clouds. He is deemed the feudal Lord for whose propitiation, offerings are made in the sacrificial rites of Dwijas below. The philosophy of Geeta inculcates the view that no selfish karma should be performed at all, that all men should do their duty with no return or reward in prospect, that all thoughts, all speech, and all action, should be dedicated unto the Supreme Being. The present story is meant to lay emphasis on this teaching.

 7. Among the characters of the play, one with whom we should form an early acquaintance is Yagnacharya. He is typical of a class found in most agraharams of Southern India, and in abundance too, wherever the village community has not suffered a whole-sale dismemberment by reason of university ideas and ideals. He is the leader of orthodoxy in Brindavan, is credited with a vast store of clerical Iore, and is the accredited authority to solve all ecclesiastical conundrums. Though he was bent with sixty summers on his back, the scriptures compelled him to enter into wedlock, and he obeyed the law by marrying at this age a young girl, Champaka by name, possessed of remarkable beauty.

 8. Installed in grahasta’s estate, Yagnacharya soon came to long for a son. He gathered his brother Pandits about him and concerted measures. Things were not in his opinion what they used to be. He protested that times had changed, as indeed they had, and that people were not quite subservient and unquestioning as they used to be. Sree Krishna had apparently brought about a revolution. He did not understand the intensity of the devotion felt towards the Boy. He could not for his life excuse or understand his wife’s platonic, ethereal, attachment to Sree Krishna, free as it undoubtedly was, and as the devotion of all Gopees was, from the slightest taint of animalism. He ardently loved rites and symbols and hugged conventionalities to his bosom. To his dismay, he saw that the Yagic Brotherhood which had been pouring tons of clarified butter into the fire was visibly thinning away in number and influence. He chafed against the tendency of the times and against the heresy of the New Faith.

 9. Wishing to start a Yagna for obtaining a son, he consulted his brethren and got up a Mahazar addressed to Indra, in which he set forth in alarming colours how times had come to be quite wicked, how heresy stalked through the land, how a rival had sprung up to dispute his sovereignty and how all Karmic Institutions were languishing. He wound up by roundly pointing out to Indra and the gods that their profession was in danger and that subsidies in the shape of oblations could no longer be expected if things got on as they did.

 10. Indra was alarmed at the news. He submitted his horoscope to astrological scrutiny. The astrologers nodded their heads and pronounced the horoscope free from prospective ill. Indra felt furious at the temerity of human pretensions which dared to defy his godhead. Narada, so well known for mischief, encouraged him in his conceit. The haughty monarch resolved to inquire into the matter and punish the terrestrial offenders.

 11. Prince Jayanta and Charioteer Matali were sent down to make a local investigation and report. These two descended from the skies in due course, and on reaching Terra Firma, each took his own route to reconnoitre and observe for himself. Jayanta assumed an ascetic’s form and sought hospitality in a hermitage that was in the occupation of a lonely virgin-girl of sweet sixteen. On every side, he met bevies of girls endowed with extraordinary beauty such as could put any heavenly nymph to shame. The environments subdued him. He was but an inexperienced youth though encased in an ascetic’s exterior, and therefore fell a prey to surging passions. He could not resist Chitrangee’s (his hostess’) electrifying charms and made overtures to her. The result was that at the end of an excited scene, he found himself metamorphosed on the spot into a eunuch by the maiden’s curse. Poor Jayanta became an ugly piece of humanity no longer fit to emerge from the Earthly prison and regain his heavenly home.

 12. In the meantime, Yagnacharya pushed on with his yagna in buoyant hopes of succour from Indra. When the yagna was in full swing, a few cowherd boys made a daring effort to rescue the sacrificial victims and made away with the whole of the consecrated flock of sheep. The whole body of wiseacres cried themselves hoarse at the polluted touch, but the plucky boys heeded them not. It was a veritable slip between the cup and the lip, the clenched fists being deprived of the prey, just when they were about to commence a massacre. In a stentorian voice of command, Yagnacharya ordered the sheep and the offenders to be seized. A boy and a sheep were produced. The boy retorted boldly in answer to Yagnacharya’s rebuke, that animal slaughter by Brahmins was improper and that SreeKrishna quite disapproved of it. The old man was fixed in a dilemma. He had no mind to give up a yagna which was nearly complete, because postponement meant further delay in the attainment of his cherished ambition. He therefore ordered the sheep to be killed and the yagna to be proceeded with. The intervention of a miracle rendered the slaughter impossible. Yagnacharya submitted to the inevitable in discomfiture and sadness. At this juncture, Matali sounded the trumpet and published, by a voice in the air, his master's proclamation hurling fulminations of divine penalty against any body that dared to offend against the ritualistic code. Yagnacharya caught at this ray of hope and resolved heroically to wait for a more propitious opportunity to perform. the yagna over again.

 13. Time wore on, and in due course, another yagna was begun. Yagnachayra took the precaution, this time, of disarming opposition by speaking to the elders of Sree Krishna’s family. Balarama interceded in the matter, advising Sree Krishna not to poke his nose into other people’s affairs. Sree Krishna protested that he never had done so and that if the Gopees were at fault he could not help it. In the course of this second yagna, Sree Krishna took his brother Balarama to a retired spot near Chitrangee’s hermitage and drew his attention to a scene that struck Balarama with amazement.

 14. Two ladies were sitting there lost in thoughtful devotion. Their dialogue related to Krishna and disclosed the heart’s sublime yearning to meet Him and offer Him worship. It showed a depth of feeling that no words could express, an excess of tenderness that few hearts could contain. Balarama was convinced, and was moved very much.

 15. The two boys left a message to the ladies and rempaired to the hermitage close by. The ladies rushed to that place, and there, sincerely, devotedly, and religiously, offered a sumptuous repast to Krishna and his friends. Krishna accepted the homage, as he is, in his Providential wisdom, pledged to accept, for the redemption and salvation of the Faithful.

 16. Of the two ladies referred to, Champaka was one. It was she that had carried the dishes of the repast from the kitchens of the Yagna–sheds. As the wife of Yagnacharya, it was gross sacrilege on her part to have left the precincts at all. What was infinitely worse, she had removed the food consecrated for divine offerings from the holy precincts. From the stand-point of Yagnacharya it was the very climax of heresy for her to have distributed it among boys. In these circumstances, the Yagna was interrupted for a second time by a serious irregularity and became abortive of results.

 17. Matali conveyed to Indra full news of the double mishap, Viz., Jayanta’s wretched plight and the oblations defiantly obstructed and withheld. Indra’s wrath was inflamed by the tale. His vanity was sorely tickled. Mere men, human mortals, had set his authority at naught. He could not tolerate it for a moment. He resolved to wage war to regain his rights and recover his son. He marshalled his forces for battle. He ordered the clouds to pour on Brindavan an unceasing shower of rain and hail, to crush it out of existence.

 18. The premonitory symptoms of the approaching storm alarmed Yagnacharya. He appealed to his kith and kin and exhorted them to leave the country. None heeded his warning. He bade adieu to the place and departed in search of a suitable shelter to save himself. Sick atheart to exile herself from Krishna’s village, his wife felt it however a duty to follow her husband’s aged footsteps.

 19. Journeying far away from home, Champaka and Yagnacharya entered the deep recesses of a mountain forest. They suffered indescribable fatigue for days on the way,and found no place of shelter anywhere. Champaka sustained herself on Hope and Faith and felt strong and cheerful. But her husband felt the sufferings intolerable. With him, it was the fatigue of the journey of life (Samsara) as experinced by one who chose to run away. from God and light to Satan and hell. He was puzzled to see his young wife’s peaceful resignation. He mistook every will-o’-the-wisp to be a hermit’s cottage and every gleam of lightning to be joyous sunshine. Thus he continuedwhat appeared to be an endless journey. It soon came to be impossible to proceed without a guide. Hunger and fatigue reduced him to despair, and so, in a fit of dire distress, he loudly called for help.

 20. To this, a response dropped as it were from the clouds. Satan who had been dogging the footsteps of the wanderers presented himself in the guise of a Forester. Yagnacharya welcomed him as a god–send. The lady however liked not his looks and felt an instinctive repulsion. The Forester used his wily arts which, though unproductive of any impression on the rocky faith of the woman, succeeded well with the old man. His orthodoxy easily gave way. His wife put forth superhuman efforts to sustain his yielding strength and restore to him his losing foot–hold. Satan felt immensely wrathful at the brave defence she was making and at the heroism with which she struggled to rescue her husband from his clutches. It was soon evident that virtue would triumph in the struggle. In a fit of fury Satan pounced on her to seize her. The infamous contact was averted by a miraculous catastrophe. The whole mountain (which happened to be Govardhana) suffered a violent shock, so that Satan dropped down hurled as if by a terrible blow.

 21. Let us return to Jayanta for a minute. Suffering acute agony from the metamorphosis, he wandered in vain all over the globe in search of relief and redress. Chance led his footsteps to Narada of whom he besought salvantion. Narada agreed at last to impart to him the secrets of occult learning and show him the Path. While the master and pupil were engaged in holy study in a remote corner of the Govardhana, Yagnacharya and his wife stumbled on the scene, after narrowly escaping from the calamity related above. Yagnacharya’s eyes began to be opened. He realized that his wife had been in the right all along and himself in the wrong. He realized the greatness of her virtues and the soundness of her advice. He felt how obstinate and selfish he had been in deserting everybody near and dear to his heart, in order to save his solitary self from a supposed danger. He heard Narada’s inspired words and wheeled round to the true Faith. Then, Narada, Jayanta, Yagnacharya, and Champaka commenced memorable journey on the high road of Bhakti. They mingled their voices in a chorus of divine hymns and started to go to the Earthly Paradise and meet Sree Krishna there.

 22. In the meantime, the wrath of Indra had borne deadly fruit. The elements tore each other in deadly conflict. Brindavan was submerged in water and it looked as if the convulsion of nature would destroy every vestige of animal life. Indra himself came down with Matali to enjoy a grimsatisfaction at the tragedy he had wrought. He was however mistaken in the idea that all the inhabitants had suffered from his wrath. In proceeding through the affected region, he did no doubt meet some men and women who were unable to swim the current and therefore got to the bottom of the flood. He met a few others swimming away (as nitya Samsarees) neither reaching the shore nor sinking to the bottom. These persons were alternately gay and sad, who eagerly snatched at any little joys they could reach even in their forlorn situation. They licked the little drop of honey that stuck to any Margosa leaf swept down by the current and even forgot their misery for the moment. It was not long before Indra met a third class of people among whom were Yagnacharya, Champaka, and a bevy of Gopikas. These were wading through knee-dee pwater in perfect peace and gaity. Hail, storm, lightning, and thunder, fell like feathers on their heads. Their thoughts were fixed on high, and they pursued the Path utterly unaffected by Indra and his clouds. They marched onward and ever onward, singing Krishna’s life in lovely sonnets, and approached a Ford where a Ferry-man Pilot awaited to tide them over the deep waters. Indra was surprised at this beyond measure. It meant that his efforts had been abortive in respect to all these people.

 23. He asked himself what the meaning of it was. What was the secret of their glowing faith and bouyancy? Who was this Krishna that wielded so much power? Who was he to charm, to captivate, and rule the minds of humanity? He was staggered at the maidens’ fortitude in resisting the storm and making for the goal. His curiosity was piqued, and so he was resolved to go along with them.He soon reached the Ford and there the Ferry-man waited to render service with alacrity. Seeing that there were numerous boats and ascertaining that the haven was within earshot Indra offered to book his passage. The Ferry-man, to his surprise, refused him a ticket. An altercation ensued. Bribery and threats were alike ineffectual. The boatswainsaid that he was not a servant working for base lucre. He told Indra that he was not qualified yet for the voyage, as he had not subdued the passions, and that, unless Indra produced a passport from Brahma or Vayu, a passage was impossible. Indra felt heart-broken at this humiliation. He retraced his steps and sought the advice of Narada.

 24. On his return, unpleasant news was waiting for him. Messengers from his army told him of the infamous defeat. they had sustained. He learnt how the heavenly hosts had been routed without a shot fired, how not a single soldier had volition enough to weild a weapon, how the Airavata elephant, together with the entire horde, and the Uchaisrava horse, with the entire cavalry, had stampeded into the enemy’s camp in abject surrender. Here was news indeed of a blood-curdling character enough to drive him mad— the invincible army of a god annihilated by a terrestrial mortal. Narada administered consolation to him at this hour and revealed to him the true condition of things.

 25. On the other side of the flood, stood Sree Krishna with the Govardhana Hill set on the top of his little finger. The whole herd of calves, and cows, and all his spiritual kith and kin, were gathered round him underneath the remarkable umbrella. For seven days, He held the Hill aloft to protect his devoted adherents. It rained cats and dogs: the thunder and lightning jammed the Hill; but not a hair of the People’s heads was injured.

 26. Indra realised his powerlessness and got his natural Faith restored to him, warped as it had been, by a temporary illusion. With contrition, he resolved to make amends for his folly. He summoned his followers to accompany him in his pilgrimage to Govardhana with every conceivable mark of worship, with every conceivable nuzzur of homage. He ordered the divine nymphs to carry Cows’ milk in countless vessels of gold to bathe Sree Krishna therein and anoint Him the Universal Sovereign.

 27. In the course of the journey, he found his son Jayanta wending his way to the same goal for obtaining redemption. Father and son mingled their tears of joy over the happy issue. They joined the general throng of devotees and reached the destination, stripped of conceit.

 28. Approaching the Lord’s Presence with all his Paraphernalia, he besought permission to offer Him pooja. Sree Krishna forgave him and granted the prayer. Indra seated Sree Krishna of the throne and poured out from the vessels of gold a shower of cows’ milk proclaiming Him as “Govinda” to the world;

 29. This is the story of the play. The plot consists chiefly of three episodes.

 (a) Yagnacharya and his wife occupy a large place in the narrative. Champaka is the ideal wife who puts her little arm round her husband’s waist, and like a steam launch towing a disabled merchant-man, bravely guides him with unerring steps in the path of righteousness.

 (b) Jayanta proud of his birth and position takes liberties with a lovely maiden and receives smart chastisement. Emancipation is eventually attained by him thro’ Sree Krishna’s grace.

 (c) Mighty Indra is humbled in the sight of gods and men for his presumption in deeming himself a god and forgetting his Master in a fit of delusion.

 30. Opinions may differ much about the author’s taste in choosing such a subject and introducing supernatural incidents into the plot. Popular Fiction is that which holds up a mirror to nature and delineates human society with all its faults and failings to inculcate a moral. But Sree Krishna is a national Hero. The picture of his environmentsfascinated me. The gopee-girls associated with Him in His pranks with a whole-hearted, rather, a whole-souled devotion illustrate etherialized love of sublime perfection. The moonlit expanse of sand on the banks of the Jumna vivified by the Divine Flute is a picture drawn by Vyasa with masterly touches, which the Poets and Poetasters of India have for centuries loved to admire and appreciate by imitative efforts of imagination.

 31. It is somewhat incongruous to introduce God as a Dramatis personæ on the stage. Any speech placed in his mouth ill befits the character, as the conditioned cannot conceive the unconditioned, and as the limited conceptions of a human author cannot in the very nature of things rise to the requisite level of sublimity. I pray that the indulgent reader will sympathise with me in my failures. I have however avoided introducing Sree Krishna as much as possible and contrived the scenes mostly without Him.

 32. My obligations to my learned father who is my Guru are of course irrepayable. My acknowledgments are also due to S. M. S. Raghavendrachar, Pandit of Kumbhakonam, who scrutinized the manuscript of this work as well as of “Dhruva’s Penance.” I am also obliged to my sincere friend Mr. K. Padmanabha Rao, B. A. B. L, Vakil, for his help in passing the sheets through the Press.

 Works filled with the nine poetic emotions and composed by persons profoundly clever in the poetic art are abundant :and those works deserve to be honoured in the world by learned men who are (themselves) clever in interpreting subtle meanings. But the present theme relating as it does to the history of Govinda may be acceptable to the learned though defiled by faults and may even obtain regard at the hands of such people as are great in forgiveness.

I am the bearer of a message of great importance from the region of the earth. The leading men thereof have sent an humble petition, together with good wishes for the perpetual prosperity of your majesty. With your majesty’s leave, I wish to read it.

** Indra**.—We will hear ; let the writing be read.

Agni reads.

the Earth the region of karmas, submit as follows after saluting humbly with hands joined over the head and making respectful inquiries about your majesty’s well-being.

 “2. Born of very learned Brahmin lineage, leading a life in which we keep up a perpetual sacrificial fire, looking forward to Indra’s grace as the only goal, prosperous in the possession of every blessing in the shape of children, wives, and so on, having propitiated the divine hosts (by worship), ever devoted to deeds and duty with a view to the present attainment of riches, women and so on, or with a desire for the great swarga in the future, we the slaves of slaves of your majesty are doing well.

 Now with reference to present purpose; owing to the wickedness of the times and because of good sense being warped by the shadow of Kali’s advent, some unrighteous people, having abandoned the observances enjoined by law and being of opinion that there is a Lord superior even to you, indulge in mad sayings that that Lord is shining radiant in our midst on the Earth in the guise of a cowherd.

 “4. Moreover, strange is their perversity; they do not in the least care for the well-being of themselves or their homes, &c. They consider that in the service of this new master no boon should be prayed for, This master is incapable of grant-

ing boons forsooth, and looks as if he is cheating his followers by instilling a tenet calculated to save his incapacity from exposure, to the effect that divine worship should not be performed with a carnal object in view.

 “5.These persons like not the meemamsa of Jaimini nor the schools of Buddhism, Akshâpâda Charvaka or Kapila. They like not sacrifices and things of that kind: nor offerings of oblations to Devas, humanity, Pitris and Bhootas. They persistently dogmatise that animal slaughter is improper in sacrifices.

 “6. They say that sage Vyasa is the greatest Teacher, and that the Interpreter of His School is Vayu. If everybody should come to think thus, it is clear that your sovereignty sir, is at an end. (Something that is given away with water in the hand).

 “७. अन्यमप्येषां वर्णयामो विपर्यासं। नित्यनैमित्तिकाचरणे यत्कुर्वन्ति यद्ददति यज्जुह्वति तन्न भवत्प्रीत्यै किन्तु वाय्वन्तर्गतस्य कस्यचिन्मनोवागगोचरस्य प्रीत्यै समर्पयन्ति। किमेवं किल कृतवन्त अस्मत्पूर्वपूर्वकाः। सर्वथा नैवमिति वदन्ति वृद्धाः॥

 “7. Another of their misdeeds too we will mention. In the performance of daily and occasional rites, whatever they do, or offer, or sacrifice, is dedicated, not for propitiating you but for securing the favour of some one who dwells in Vayu’s heart and who is beyond the reach of thought and speech. Did our ancestors of old behave like this? Elders say that it was not so at all.

 “8. Why dilate by recounting the irregularities in the fulfilment of household duties. Every day, the divine offering, before it is offered to the deity, is being carried away in secret by our daughters-inlaw, daughters or sisters for being eaten by that same cowherd; our women have forsooth been spell-bound by a world-enchanting beauty of appearance.

 “9. This subject does not admit of indifference. If neglected, then, there will be no offering hereafter to the gods. Let the gods too resign their offices, close the doors of Heaven and repair to some other world. Thus is the petition accompanied by innumerable and continued prostrations.”

 **Indra.—**Oh Brihaspatyacharya, the calculation of the astrologers seems based on misconceptions, or perhaps the astrologers consulted by you are of doubtful proficiency in the science, or perhaps the teachings of astrology do not produce the promised results. This earthly news is not a source of cheerfulness to us.

**Brihaspati.—** Sir, your scepticism as to the truth of the science is not warranted. The astrological science is majestic like the sea. It consists of countless rules and exceptions. The calculations of Aries, &c. of the Zodiac is the result of great thought and labour. Moreover, astrologers following traditional methods, will not disclose the ills of futurity though observed without doubt. But in your case, we see no misfortune in the future to be afraid of.

**Indra.—**Let the discussion about the truthfulness of the science cease: which witness knows about the truth or otherwise of the allegations in the petition read out.

** Agni.—**The Sun who is an observer of all actions is present here to inform your majesty about all that he has seen.

Then enters the Sun.

** Indra.—** Sun, what do you know in this affair? Give us full information.

 **Sun.—**Appointed no doubt as an observer of every Karma, I do notice everything in doing my appointed task with diligence. But owing to the rotation of the wheel of time, my prowess is non-existent at nights. Therefore what transpires during one half of every day has to be gathered from the mouth of the Moon.

** Indra.—**Let alone what should be heard from Chandra’s mouth. We are ready to hear what you have seen.

** Sun.—**On the surface of the Earth ordinarily enveloped in dense gloom and filled with mud and stones, I now observe a disc of matchess brilliancy whose rays radiate everywhere and bless the whole world. Indeed I quail under the purity and supreme grandeur of the immeasurable dazzle which no eyes can bear to see. Being far away I am unable to notice any group of objects except that.  
 I can certainly tell you, O, king of Suras, what they say in that other world as to the truth of the matter. They say that He is the upholder of the egg of universe, one who is an embodiment of Intellect and Bliss and absolutely Independent.

 Those who are steeped in devotion to that limitless Being of wonderful greatness, have nothing to fear from the lowering Devas, nor have they a boon to ask of Indra. It is said that He too the foe of Kama, never abandons those people who are his followers and devotees, that is, the adepts having their thoughts fixed firmly in Chakri (the wheeled One) alone, and that this is certain.

** Indra**.**—** All this that is mentioned by you is no answer to the question. Should there happen to be One greater than ourselves anywhere‚ we shall hear of him at some other place and time from the mouth of ourPreceptor:you don’t seem to know about the misbehaviour in the matter of rites referred to in the petition.

 Who is there? Let the Moon be brought here for enquiry.

Then enters the pleasant-faced Moon.

** Moon.—**Victory, victory to the great king mounted on the throne of the gods.

** Indra.—** Moon, news has come to the effect that on the Earth in the country about Brindavan, there are many people hostile to sacrificial rites, who are bent on disobeying our rule. We wish to ascertain the truth from you.

** Moon.—** Questioned by venerable elders, I am incapable of stating anything but the truth. If

स्ति कुत्रास्ति तत्रास्तीति चिरन्तनकालीयविचारो विरम्यतइतः परम्। विश्वंभरायामेकदेशप्रदेशो वैकुण्ठः॥ (इत्यर्धोक्ते।)

my evidence be unpleasant, I beg to be forgiven on the ground that Ispeak the truth. A question agitated for ages as to Vaikunta, that “it is here: where is it ? it is there,” is set at rest hereafter. Vaikunta is only a portion of the earth.

** Brihaspati—**This witness the Moon does not deserve credence. It is he that, being addicted to low gallantry as a partisan of Cupid, is said to inflame the passionate enjoyments of cowherd boys and maidens. The rumour is that on the banks of the Jumna when this Moon is at his height of pride, hypnotism of the damsels’ minds takes place.

**Sukracharya.—**Moreover these two, the Sun and Moon are debased tale-bearers. Their testimony does not deserve credit. When nectar was being served out they caused the death of Rahu and Ketu, fellow-diners in their company, who had done them no harm at all.

 The Sun is always proud at heart fancying that being a destroyer of darkness, he is of unequalled greatness. But the owl moving about in the gloom of night laughs at him with glee to see him void of light. The Moon highly boastful of moon-light, and proud of possessing soothing rays, derides the galaxy of stars. But the fevered maiden afflicted by the power of Cupid laughs with indignation at the incapacity of the Moon (to sooth her).

** Narada.—**Oh Mahendra, known to fame as the foremost genius in all the 3 worlds, I am greatly surprised to see your anxiety. Where has your prowess vanished, renowned up to the extreme limits of space. Where, your matchless supremacy? Where has your thunderbolt gone? Alas, does it lie exhausted by the fatigue of chopping off the wings of mountains: where have they gone, the Airavata and the elephants and guardians of the 8 quarters? Do they disregard your commands? You seem powerless to enforce obedience to your orders because of old age or some other cause.

 I fear not man in the least; I have conquered hosts of Daityas in war. I do not fear the spell of illusory magic, O preceptor, as I possess wonderful weapons of spell.  
 I know not in earth or heaven of a living chariot-warrior superior to me, capable of defeating me in battle. Still, O sage, my mind is perplexed as if some object of pleasure once remembered has slipped outof memory.

the leaders of Daityas in war. But now, I think, he is lost altogether, by reason of prolonged addiction to ambrosial drink, by deep indulgence in luxuries and by constant alliance with giddy and flashing courtesans.

 Of old, Dasaratha the vanquisher of foes rendered help by lending his might, out of regard for the obligations of friendship: By this means victory was attained in direful war. Ravana and Hiranya Kasipu, the foes of gods, were smashed and slaughtered like flies for the well-being of all good people by the might of Devendra, is it not! as you all know forsooth.

 Fire blazes up when the fuel is stirred; the snake when irritated expands its hood; verily, a man generally regains his own high-spiritedness through being roused to action.

** Krishna.—**Verily, the wonderful attachment felt by this dear friend bears no fruit, unless, it extends to all creatures, my adherents and friends. Why should she with great disgust spurn from her door-sill the cat that follows me.

** Rama.—**At the dawn of every day, he walks up to the herd of cows and unfastens the ropetie of calves unperceived. Tell me, madam, how without milk in a family of crying children I can get credit for managing the house-hold.

** Yasoda.—**Darling, what is your excuse for this offence?

** Krishna.—**I was brought up fondled with affection by you and father. Fond of moving about, I am always an unfettered wanderer.

Once I suffered the bitterness of experience tied by waist to a mortar. Hence I release from bondage all creatures devoted to me.

 Moreover, mamma, when the calves were suckling the udders, I went up to the mothers and whispered in their ears “whenever you are asked to furnish milk for Krishna, it must be supplied by you without fail.” The cow nodded her head and gave me assent.

 If the Gopee takes the milk-pail even though it be an unseasonable hour, the cow of pot-like udder supplies milk, pricking

** Mohini—**At dawn, when I was sound asleep (engulfed in sleep) in bed on a cot in my room along with dear brothers and sisters, Krishna caught hold of my hair and knotted it with their tufts. Waking up after sleep, finding myself restrained by the tufts, and being utterly unable to untie the knot, I repaired to the forest with the relations and, alas, did not find that Krishna.

** Yasoda.—** Really, this appears to be a bad act.

At parting, both my feet left on the gravelled floor imprints characterised by the Primeval letters, unmistakeably indicating the route that my followers should take.

** Mrugakshee.—** Yesterday, in the exultation of the company cf crowds of boys, he went with Balarama into a room and, closing the door, the cunning fellow mimicked idolworship by means of pieces of mud and

 Hearing his words, I looked through the key-hole out of curiosity and saw him a magnificent God seated on a throne consisting of a Lordly Serpent’s body with the face of Balarama. (His) friends belauded Him as follows:

You have been brought up with tenderness under the influence of kindly words, with a lustre resembling that of flowers, in Swarga, amidst great comforts, surrounded by divine footmen, in garden Nandana and (other) lovely spots.

 Begetting a son, the mother has to be separated from him and feel uneasy about his fame. Begetting a daughter only to bestow on a husband, she has to wear away with heavy sobs at being parted from her.

 I do not think the surface of the Earth a fitting abode to one of your good disposition. Various are the temptations that exist there drawing away the mind. I know that it was there that Narada the great sage suffered miserable womanhood as the result of a woman’s curse, and begot sixty sons named after the years of the calendar.

** Jayanta.—**What, this prince of ascetics, the Reverend Devarshi, wandered about, did he? in the bondage of mortal life for sixty thousand years, abandoning his Veena Brihati, the ascetic’s sceptre, and the waterjar and other paraphernalia, giving up Pranava and penances,—clad in feminine garments, wearing a bodice and earthen

bangles, both right up to the elbow, and lulling crying children (to sleep) in a cradle with his body covered with the uncleanliness of infants! Wonderful, wonderful! I shall ask the sage in public Durbar how it was that he came to be punished in this manner.

  However, this is an old story. The denizens of the Earth are now said to be of a different character.

** Sachi.—**Dear boy, not so. I have heard from the mouth of Kubera that his two sons Nala-Koobara and Manigreeva of great prowess went to Kailasa and then to the Earth. There, becoming metamorphosed into two trees of the forest, bearing flowers and fruits in an interminable succession, not obtaining release though over thousands of years

passed away, they grew very high as if to peep in disguise at their native world through crevices in the region of the clouds, and, after being disappointed and suffering penances in prolonged dumbness, have at last returned home getting liberation by an accident. Rumour says that even now there is doubt about their mental soundness.

 Though they are trees no longer, they observe reticence from a recollection of the past. With eyes ever turned upwards, they appear as if steeped in a sea of abstraction. When the society of relations is holding conversation they do not mingle in the talk. They treat all the treasures of Kubera with contempt and look mad for all appearance.

 They roam about at will and are at no time mindful of family (wife) or food or anything delicious. Indeed, they are always mumbling some mantra with delight. They are always in meditation in order to renounce all objects of pleasure, and, by disregarding ablutions, to cast away the body itself, which, fashioned out of light, deserves to be ornamented with clusters of gems.

** Jayanta.—**Not thus mother; now the Earth does not seem unworthy of being journeyed through by the righteous people. Almost everyday in the bright fortnight, Kinnaras, Vidhyadharas and Gandharvas of both sexes attend a concert-audience on earth. On return they look filled with ecstasy. There

young sun is himself coming forward with radiance swollen by pride, and is gambolling with a full display of glow in the window-crevices of lotus-damsels, although a kinsman (like himself) of the ocean, Viz., the moon, has just died.

 What! are a thousand eyes sufficient to gaze on this dense charming pleasure-garden that forms a collection of floral beauties, that is filled with scented damsels, that forms a spot refreshed by the gentle breeze, that is the sporting ground of the Goddess of Fortune (Lakshmi), and that is filled with soft and soothing sounds and the melodious hum of bees ?

There too, without having an end of the troubles of love byreason of seeing damsels like these, they surely proclaim well by means of whirling tufts the reeling of madness.

 (To herself). Lord, I curse this wretch. Pardon me. If my mother is a chaste lady, and my father, a great man of faultless mind, if I am a chaste woman of piety, engaged in the contemplation of Krishna and never thoughtful of any other person my husband, then may this fellow become a eunuch, so that he may no longer cause pain to women, and may no redemption take place to him except by a contemplation of Thy feet.

*Behind scenes.*

 Alas, Alas! From the woods, a herd of elephants with she-elephants and little ones following behind with a destructive roar, along a road rendered miry from a constant shower of liquids flowing from their delirious forehead, temples and trunks, is rushing forward without belly-ropes, or bondage, or the tail rope, unrestrained by the chain or the spear, frightened by the excitement of an uproar caused by the great ringing of hunters' bows, by the whistle of powerful darts, and by the Jhana Jana noise

**Act III.**

**Scene I.**

**Gokulam— Sacrificial Shed.**

*Enter Yagnacharya, Purohit and others;  
Engaged in sacrificial rite*.

**Yagnacharya.—** (Oblation to Agni (Fire); To Agni, this, not mine. Oblation to Indra; to Indra this, not mine; (exhibiting the preliminary oblations poured in the fire). Oblation to Agni.

 Reverend Sirs, if this sacrifice for getting issue-be performed, my wish will be achieved: Is it not?

 इति वचनाद्विप्रत्वं भवत्सु किल सम्पूर्णमस्ति॥

—————————————————————————————————————————

**Purohit.—** “ Oblation to Varuna; To Varuna this, not mine”. There is not the slightest doubt about it. Here are present as members of the assembly, men of great eminence, performers of great sacrifices. *Sthapathi*, one who has done Brihaspathi yaga, *Somapas*, \[Somayaga\] Sarva Vedas, (one who has done Visvajit yaga in which all is given away as Dakshina). Here are present men skilled in the performance of sacrifices to Devas, men, Pitris and Bhootas, performers of rites enjoined by Rig Veda, Yazur Veda and Sâma Veda.

* Addressing the Acharyas.*

 “He is styled a Brahmin who performs these 6 acts (1) sacrifice, (2) study, (3) gift, (4) officiating as a sacrificial priest, (5) teaching, and (6) acceptance of gift” From this saying, it is only in you that Brahminism exists in full perfection.

**Acharyas.—** Quite so. It is the unanimous opinion of all that there is no blessing unattainable on a divine sacrificial ground like this.

**Vedantin.—**What is meant by the expression ‘Adyayana’ (study)?

**Purohit.—** By the expression Adyayana is meant a recitation of the Vedic chapter relating to Karma, a kind of physical process relating to the palate and the lips, accompanied by intonation.

**Vedantin.—** Preceded by a grasp of its meaning or not!

**Purohit.—** Not at all.

**Adhwaryu.—**Among the Vedas, elders deem the recitation of Yazur Veda as particularly meritorious.

**Udgata.—** It is Sama Veda that is excellent. Its supremacy is well known in Smriti. *e.g.* “I am Sâma Veda among Vedas (Geeta.)"

**Hota.—** Nothing is equal to Rig Veda.

**Vedantin.—** What about the Upanishads?

**All.—** The Upanishads are the *barren soil* of the Vedas.

**Vedantin.—** What is the determining feature of superiority.

**All.—** Melody alone.

**Vedantin.—** Of the 5 great sacrifices, there is one called Brahma yagna. What is it?

**All.—**The cultivation of Vedic barren soil becomes only those who are incompetent to perform the other sacrifices.

*Behind scenes.*

 Alas, Alas; the sacrificial victims sanctified by mantras have been carried away by the cowherd boys.

**Yagnacharya.—**Osirs, what is this calamity that has occurred! Is there a remedy for it or not? The gopas, men and women, give me frequent trouble. Let the whip be fetched to chastise the cowherd boys.

*Then the Peons bring a cow-boy along with  
a Victim sheep.*

**Gopa.—**Krishna says that the torment of a living. Pasu (victim) is forbidden and that the rite should be completed by means of a Pasu made of flour.

**Yagnacharya.—** What, sirrah, are you so wise as to teach elders in this matter?

**Gopa.—** Old sir, Krishna says that you do not perform the rite out of pious thoughts, that some of you are indeed hypocrites mindful of ostentation and bent on fame, grow long beards, and adhere to Karma from mere selfishness, aiming only at the goals of conventional duty, wealth, and desire, and no more.

**Yagnacharya.—** Sirrah, impious wretch, release thevictim.

**Gopa.—**Do not, O Do not, vent (your) wrath on this pitiable sheep naturally innocent and inoffensive. By whom has license been given to you to kill without mercy the creature which clings to life with fondness, and possesses common feelings of pleasure and pain with you?

**Vedantin.—** Let a convincing reply be given.

**Yagnacharya.—**Sensible persons say that the words of a boy and his impertinent questions are not entitled to regard. Animal torture

**Gopa.—** Great skill in disputations over the shastras, and cleverness in creating a delusion in the minds of ignorant people,— this has been acquired by you by loud recitations and by a laborious cram of logical platitudes. Sound knowledge has not been obtained at all. How is it that the minds of you Deekshitas (sacrificial Acharyas) have here turned to wicked ways, in which sheep is slaughtered, and to animal food however agreeable to appetite?

It is a wonder that you are not ashamed, that you are (deemed) learned people though devoid of any thoughts bestowed on the foot-pair of God supreme. Honour is due to you because of old age, infirmity, and shaken teeth, and not because of wisdom. In the world, there are indeed great and pious penitents whose unsullied minds are fixed on Hari, and who think of Brahma even while seated under Kalpa trees and in the ocular presence of heavenly nympus.

**Yagnacharya.—**Fie on the utterance of this fellow, taught by some ignorant person. It will not be acceptable to elders. Peons, seize the victims with a view to slaughter and kill them with (your) armed (sword-wielding) hands for the completion of the sacrificial rite.

** Gopa.—** (*To himself*)

 O Hari (ever) engaged in kindly providence, and merciful to all creatures, they are killing Thy creatures mercilessly, perverted (rendered wicked ) by haughtiness. Incapable as they are to make a single dead thing alive by the force of even a hundred sacrifices, how bold are they in causing death, for the sake of themselves, (their) homes, women and children? O tender hearted Hari, kinsman of all creation, who busied Thyself in feeding cats, in liberating inanimate trees, in carefully tending cows, and in promoting the joys of Vraja's inhabitants, Oh Murari, God supreme, the flock of victims (sheep) beseeches Thy mercy.

**Yagnacharya.—** Having wedded a wife for the sakeof issue, I have long been broken-hearted by the grief of barrenness. Alas (now), the obstacle to the realization of (my) wish by seeking the divine favour of the Lord of the Heavens!

**Yagnacharya.—** Hear, ye learned people, the voice of gods; the gods have sent a message forming a satisfactory reply to our petition, calculated to please the good and destroy the elated spirits of sacrificial marplots. Listen; hereafter, we will perform these ‘purposeful-rites’ devoid of all fear.

 We will release these Pasoos polluted as they are by sacriligeous contact: we will carry out our object at some other time auspicious enough to ensure an unimpeded fulfilment of the rite.

 The women of Vraja entered upon the arena of sand, singing and dancing in various places, bathed in the stream of the Jumna, adorned themselves with jewels,and invited the Lord by various songs, their thoughts focussed on Him and themselves owning no souls but Him.

 Then appeared Hari, a veritable Cupid of Cupids; came forth the Lord of the Universe, the sanctifier of all that is holy on earth— the solitary goal of Vedas, in

 At midnight was commenced by the Lord the music of the flute in all the variety of the seven musical pitches. From the holes of the bamboo flowed forth a stream of nectar; varieties of tunes started away to awake Brahma, Siva, and all.

 The gopees rendered unconcious of the body and clothes, fell into a meditative trance. Goddesses from Lakshmi donwards descending from their abodes became presiding deities in the creepers of adjoining gardens, in Tulasi, and other plants, imparting superiority to them by means of unusual fragrance, and stayed away in (those) inanimate objects, stricken mute by the music, with a view to ponder over its import.

 Then all the beings asked each other, “if this is not Vykunta, where else is that world.”

**Champaka.—**The story of how I came away is a long one.

**Chitrangee.—**As it relates to the Lord I wish to hear. Tell (me) all.

**Champaka.—**I woke up at dawn; called to mind the Lord Gopeenath, the deity worthy of universal adoration; and reflected as follows: O Lord, save Thy adherent, slave of slaves; enter the abode of my heart,sanctify the floor of my heart with the particles of Thy foot-lotus; may Thy two feet sport therein for ever. May it dislodge the dense beginningless ignorance therefrom. May Thy judgment consume the hoard of sins therein, the growth of a time devoid of beginning, a hoard that is not removable by anybody except Thee.

 Moreover I called to mind the words of my father uttered at the instance of the Priest at my wedding (viz) “I give this girl unto the bridegroom,—unto Lakshmi-Narayana dwelling in the bridegroom.”I stared fixedly at my husband who lay in bed and slept profoundly, thinking to myself “within him, is it not, shines the crowning jewel of a husband to me.”

 O joy, in the internal cave of his heart I then visioned Sri Lakshmee’s Lord. I swooned away at the ecstasy and delirium caused by seeing (face to face) the Dweller within my husband. I recollected what indescribable sufferings I underwent in the jungle-journey of carnal lives with innumerable husbands wedded to me in count-

less crores of births, (and pondered), “Oh joy, it is *now* that the fruit of mortal incarnations is reaped: it is now that the bestowal of the Lord’s graceful glance has occurred.” Thus filled with joy, I sang the morning tune (Udayaraga) and belauded Him.

 Rising from bed, thinking only of the Lord, feeling enraptured by His Visioned Form, and hoping for a recurrence of Hari’s personal visions again and again, as betokened by auspicious omens met with at daybreak, I praised the Lord by reciting the compositions of revered authors.

 Enjoined by the mother-in-law in various duties of the household, I did them, though absent-minded, for fear of transgressing elder’s orders. At that time I heard the

Distracted thereby and forgetting the business assigned to me, I mixed up gingelly, Bengal gram, pulses, and mustards, with husks of grain, and ran to meet the enchanter in the house hardby. Not findinghim there and returning home, I became immersed in thought. Then Ireflected with joyful tears: “I know not what service I rendered in other births to elders of learned ancestry and preceptors of shastric lore; what worship I did to Sri Lakshmi Narayana dwelling in the husband’s form; I know not how I served the Lord by hundreds of thousands of fasts on Ekadasi

Oh joy, that I have met the Resplendent Lord in visual communion. Making up my mind that this body is a commodity of the universal King, I adorned it with jewels to render it a suitable dowry of the great God. I stood before a mirror as high as a man. I dressed the hair, wore the plaited braid, decorated the ears and nose, wore a medalled neck-lace, wore earrings made of diamonds and gold, shining bangles on the wrists, armlets over the arms, resplendent rings on fingers, surrounded the waist with belt, put

Thus did I seek Him, the Kaustuba gem of the ocean consisting of the Yadu race, the august fruit of the Kalpa tree consisting of Yasoda's accumulated merits,—the Moon of the chakora birds consisting of the delighted eyes of Vraja’s inhabitants,―the

I roamed about in the pleasure-garden Nandana riding the elephant Airâvata. I considered my existence created only for an incessant enjoyment of sensual pleasures with damsels, Rambhá and others. Alas the woe! Osage, I am utterly unable to bear it.

 Alas, Alas, this my god has verily turned hard-hearted and merciless. Alas, by His ordainment, even the splendour of Indra has lost its lustre. It may be that I have

This fire of love, of dormant animation, is smouldering in my heart, and, being prevented from bursting into flame by a eunuch’s condition, chokes my breath.

 A person of congenital blindness bears the discomfort by reason of having had no experience of sight before, and indeed, longs not to gaze on the variegated colours of the rainbow. Having seen all the good and beautiful forms existing in the three worlds, I have been suddenly afflicted with blinded eyes, but with a longing desire still fixed on the pleasures of sight.

**Narada.—**Dear boy, I know the terrible sufferings caused by the curse of a chaste woman, having myself suffered womanhood and begotten sixty sons with trouble. At last, Ibecame released only through the kindness of the lady herself; the gods Brahma, Siva, and all the rest, were unable (to rescue me) though besought.

**Jayanta.—**There is vast difference between your condition and mine. The whole universe consisting of all moving and motionless objects is subject to the classification of being masculine or feminine. A creature is capable of enjoying every kind of pleasure even in a feminine birth.

 There will be no grief to mein being born a woman like Rambha. What is the sacrifice in undergoing birth as a gopee like Chitrangee possessing the power to bless and to curse? I consider even widowhood better than the condition of a eunuch. To be the wife of a Deva, of a Pitri, or of a great man, is indeed to be prayed for. Indeed, in the world, there is the wife who is elegant, beautiful, virtuous, and who is a source of joy to (her) husband, enjoying

the pleasures of various conditions of life—at one time, sensuous and passionate, an excitable lady irritated by the frivolities of love—then, a pregnant woman radiant in festivities such moon-light dinners arranged by lots of relations, then, a mother of a warrior son, a matron of a large family, and then the head of the family itself with an old age honoured by the daughter- in-law and others.

 Thus she shines in the fulfilment of duties enjoined (by the shastras). There is not the slightest pain in accepting a condition like that.

**Narada.—**You are a lad using a jumble of words, misled into a belief of wisdom. Know you the saying of great sages of learning and the pronouncement of the scriptures determining the Vedic import. “Fie on this

 The poor man desires wealth from a delusion that he would attain the highest goal from riches. One who is full of riches courts a position that carries dignity, and authority to punish (his fellows). Upon attaining that, he (then) fancies that a woman’s faultless beauty is the goal of human existence. But the monarch possessing a house filled:with every covetable object, still sighs, distracted by care.

**Leela.—**He, Krishna, is (himself) a wonderful weaver, whose clothing is space itself, who is always clad in fresh yellow robes, and who, without the aid of a loom is going to create innumerable heaps of clothes to eave Droupadi.

**Leela.—**Vayu, the bearer of scents, is indeed a favourite servant of Vishnu the Lakshmee’s Lord. When the essence of sandal is entrusted with him, Vayu certainly carries it to Hari (his) master.

of fine small leaves out of them, here I hold to offer it to the Lord in devotion. Where is the elusive Being gone, despising even Tulasi the favourite of Hari?

**Leela.—**(Hari), the kinsman of the faithful, reigns by His presence in the midst of every forest where the Tulasi plants abound. Does one, who is blissful with the nectar of an ocean of milk, beg for a little butter-milk, Oh friend.

**Champaka.—**I gathered for the Lord a basketful of Kunda flowers lovely in whiteness. Verily, the Kunda has lost its colour and bloom from the heat of (its) sad and forlorn condition brought about by his absence.

**Leela.**—Krishna is no bee to save the lotus; on the other hand, I consider that he is an enemy

**Leela.—**Friend, by shutting up your eyes and looking within with a steadied mind and with devotion, you see inside there, the Supreme God Hari, the thief who stole the mind, as well as your mind, itself.

**Scene 1.**

**Nanda’s House.**

*Enter Nanda, Yagnacharya and Champaka.*

**Yagnacharya.—**Wench, where have you been? Sir, you better ask where she went to, leaving  
the sacrificial shed without my permission; woe me! and with the sacred twist (still) round the wrist, taking fruits and flowers, in secret, and treating the sacrificial vow with contempt, the self-willed wretch.

**Nanda.—**Madam, whither did you go?

**Champaka.—**(My) revered husband himself knows.

**Yagnachrya.—**I do know: but was my permission obtained?

**Nanda.—**Whither did she go?

**Yagnacharya.—**To your son at Chitrashala hermitage: madam is it not true?

**Champaka.—**Yes.

**Yagnacharya.—**Fool that I am; by marrying at the completion of my sixtieth year, this woman of divinely symmetrical beauty resembling a heavenly nymph, I have become a dotard whose heart is subdued by infatuation. She has been the Queen in (my)

————————————————————————————————————————————————————

house and I have been content with the position of a mere servant: but she, the “mistress of sacrifice”, departed, deserting me and transgressing the course of ordained law.

**Champaka.—**I implore forgiveness of your reverence, if my action unfortunately was (happens to be) improper. After rendering obeisance to (my) husband, I only went to One who is the protector of all husbands, because He is the universal Protector; (I went) to Lakshmee’s Lord, the Delight of all, the Deva of Devas, to One who is adored by the countless hosts of gods. I carried dishes of food, and offered (their) savoury essence at the feet of the Lord.

—————————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Yagnacharya.—**(All) my effort supported by the force of a long-sustained piety (merit) has been frustrated by her conduct: all the pious offerings intended for Devas have been distributed among boys. Your Krishna possessing the lovely face of a clear moon, is no doubt dear to me; but I did not believe him to be the Protector of all protectors and the sovereign of the gods.

**Champaka.—**May sin be averted! Let not this be said at all. He is the universal Father that became a son; thereby, the lying-in chamber became a temple; the Jumna river of a majestic flow, became a shallow pond; the whole race of Daityas became

(powdered) bits of grass; two trees became a pair of Gandharvas; Gokula became Vykunta itself; all this, because He became a man.

*Enter Jayanta like a lunatic, beside himself  
with fury.*

**Jayanta.—**Alas, my god! my how Ihas turned out a cry in the wilderness. What is this curse of a wretched girl, that bids fair to plunge me into a poignant misery unrelieved by a particle of joy: the head whirls with dishevelled hair; Death takes me not to his abode: Fire does not convey the news to Heaven. The gods, Brahma, Siva, and the rest are indifferent towards me. There is none in the three worlds paying heed to the cries of my afflicted throat. There is no Kalpa tree to grant my wish. All beings are going about, bent on their own business, delirious with joy. The cuckoo,

the parrot, and the sparrow, make a loud noise and sport away. These wretched damsels, with cheeks like the back of turtles; are going about without any experience of grief, manifesting ceaseless joy upon their countenances, and devoted to songs.

(*Going forward and seeing Nanda.*)

 Sir, hear my asseveration; god will not tolerate an improper causeless cruelty like this. There is indeed a world beyond this (a life after death), and there are also penal laws of king Yama. An incessant flow of my tears will not turn out vain.

 I warn you the great Nanda, the head of Vraja, and the well-wisher of Gokulam, (apparently) fearless of danger from any quarter. Soon, will the thunder-bolt of Heaven accompanied by rain and the roar of clouds, fall on your heads, as an agency to destroy the wicked (sinful).

**Nanda.—**May evil be averted; may misfortune become thwarted! Who are you that invoke calamity on Brindavan without any cause?

**Jayanta.—**It is not without cause.

**Nanda.—**Say, what is the cause?

**Jayanta.—**Has it not been heard by you that. Chitrangee, a follower of your son, cursed me so as to annihilate (transform) my condition.

————————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Nanda.—**What offence did you commit?

**Jayanta.—**Nothing at all. What is the offence in a youth wishing to marry a fresh, youthful, beautiful girl of virgin (untasted) underlip.

**Nanda.—**Who is this girl that hurls a curse on a youth out of (a mere) aversion to wedded life (marriage).

**Jayanta.—**I shall mention, if you possess the ability to obtain for me a cancellation of the curse.

**Nanda.—** A cancellation of the curse is impossibleif there was fault in you.

**Jayanta.—** All these are wicked people. By none of them is a word of consolation given to me. There will be ruin, ruin.

————————————————————————————————————————————————————

**Nanda.—**Who is this person looking mad and stricken with grief?

**Yagnacharya.—**Sir, it is rumoured that he is the son of Devendra himself. We apprehend danger to Brindavan. Belief is not easily born for people like you. Still I consider that Gokulam is on the eve of danger. Every now and then the sound of trumpets is heard. We don’t know its meaning.

 We tremble to see the line of clouds moving fast along the horizon, filled with the roar of elephants, and engaged as the spies of Indra, as it were, (We tremble) also at the rumbling of earthquakes.

**Nanda.—**Reverned sir, all evils disappear at the contemplation of Vishnu.

**Yagnacharya.—**Verily, Hari likes only the poor; no prosperity results from the attainment of His grace; great is the disaster flowing from a breach of the daily and special ceremonial observances. Therefore I leave this country with (my) family.

**Champaka.—**My lord, I wish to say something. In the three worlds, or (for the matter of that) in all the fourteen worlds, where is the spot equal to Gokulam sanctified as it is by the dust of Sri Krishna's feet. Alas, surprising is it that there should be a departure *from* here, in order to avert misfortune.

The mendicant living upon alms is enveloped in profound sleep though (lying) on a floor of stones, (whereas) the king enjoying the luxuries of bed, spends the night without sleep, tormented by disease. Every man, be he in Benares or in Kânchi, reaps the due fruits of his actions; the destiny of everyone accompanies himjust as fragrance accompanies the lotus-blossom.

 Blackness may possibly get dissociated by effort from gloom. Sweetness may by great exertion be distilled away from honey. The great tree may stand in the sun, bereft of its (own) shadow. But misfortune ordained by destiny will never part from the man and stand aloof.

Abandoning a pond that is close at hand, cool and crystalline with abundance of lotus blossoms, (abandoning) the basin of a river majestic with the soft melody of the current flowing on a bed of rocks—a pleasure-garden dense with beautiful flower-trees so cool and shady as to dispel sun's heat as absolutely non-existent—a region of orchards bearing fruits of such sweetness as to put nectar itself to shame, (abandoning all these), does a starving, thirsty, man resort to a country stricken with famine, possessing no harvest, and parched up by want of rain. When there is, within ear-shot and within the range of call, Lakshmee's Lord, the giver of every boon, which pauper is it that rushes away to a foreign country, despising Him like one (avoiding) moonlight with an umbrella?

Here is present the dispeller of all evils, One from whom the totality of sins or faults. remains banished,— the Sun able to suck up every sin—Murari, the ocean of auspicious attributes. Never make up your mind, Oh do not, to get away from a place like this so estimable, from the Presence of the Lord. All blessed people from Atala, Vitala, and so on, up to Satya, are journeying *hither*, vieing with one another to be the foremost in rendering homage to the Lord. I am only a woman. To you profoundly versed in the scriptures, there is nothing special to be elaborately explained. Here-after, you may do as you please.

  Be a husband ever so vicious, unlucky, old, wicked, diseased, or poor, he is not to be forsaken by his wife, provided he is not depraved and guilty of a felonious crime.

**Sachee.—**What is the cause of your returning alone? Yours is a faded face, oh Matali; what is the reason; why are your soft lovely features bereft of light? From your faltering words, it is clear that you feel a choking throat; say, say the truth, is my son safe?

**Indra.—** “But is as good as dead.” Is this the remaining portion?

**Matali.—** It is indeed well-known that a slight ill luck of great personages is easily avertable.

**Indra.—** If slight, why this hesitation to mention it clearly?

**Sachee.—** I certainly fear, it is not slight. Royal lord, observe the tremor of his body and faltering speech.

**Indra.—** (*Closely observing it*) All that has occured is clearly ascertained from the picture.

 In a pleasure-garden filled with attractions, Chitrangee, a charming maiden of fresh youthfulness, a flashing creeper of lightning, vanquished the heart of Jayanta and while he, being in a pitiable plight, void of natural reason, as the slave of passion, transgressed the limits of propriety, she transformed him into an ugly eunuch, by means of a curse, in a fit of rage.

beauty, an embodiment of goodness, possessing ring-like curls of hair over his face, and shining better than the disc of the moon, has been debased by a woman of human origin.

**Matali.—** O monarch of the gods, the haughtiness of the fawn-eyed ladies, it is impossible to describe. They say that the upholder of the Universe, the adored Lord, has incarnated amongst them. The said women of arrogant minds, offered even the divine oblation forming the food of Devendra to Krishna, treating you too with contempt at his instigation.

**Indra.—** Hereafter, my mind wavers not. The food approaching the mouth has been cut off. My jewel of a son, who is an embodiment of good qualities, has been deformed, and is almost a corpse. Be this Krishna an immortal or a mortal; hereafter there is no occasion for politeness (courtesy). The question is whether the prowess of Indra is a fact or a fiction. Therefore, let the reins of restraint (hitherto) obstructing the

I feel not a particle of pleasure from a sovereignty like this.

 The hollow of the crown on my head is filled with poisonous cobras. The head is bitten severely by their sharp fangs with fury.

 This throne, made of gold, resembles a seat of pointed thorns. I care not for (this) sovereignty after the loss (both) of the son and of the tribute.

 Narada and others speak of this Murari as a powerful warrior, as the destroyer of the fears and troubles of his followers, as the kinsman of the universe, and as the adored deity of Devas and the rest. When luck is not propitious and the time is not opportune, the goddess of Fortune should not be invoked. Any undertaking leads to certain discomfiture, if time be unfavourable.

**Yagnacharya.—** No blame attaches, where it cannot be helped.

**Forester.—**Similarly, for both of you coming to my house and accepting my hospitality. Bâda rayana's theory is "any kind of food is permitted when life is in peril: such is the law."

**Yagnacharya.—**Dear, purificatory rules are set forth in the shastras for everything (breach).

That country has an even temperate climate the heat and cold being balanced equally). In the pleasure garden amidst the royal jake

**Forester.—**There is; my subjects are ever happy with the drink of grape-juice. They wander about among the mountains, tending herds of buffaloes without care and without the troubles of matrimony. Here, atheism is rife; the sense of virtue arising from a fear of sins does not exist (reside) ; the rites enjoined by Vedas and Smrities are of unknown regard in this mountain-town.

 She remained for some time seized with fear, (then) was she perplexed, immersed in meditation, or steeped in an ocean of wonder, upon realizing the greatness of her son; poured out a rain of praise; was again dumbfounded, stunned; then, danced, and sang, and meditated......Therefore, pious people entertain no doubt about the god-head of Krishna.

**Narada.—** Is the cause thereof known?

**Champaka.—**This is the undoubted truth.

**Narada.—**Moreover, the dejection of your face states as a tale-teller that a short while ago you both were greatly troubled and felt an aching heart.

**Champaka.—**Who could be this terrible person ?

**Narada.—**He is Kali, the poison Kala-koota of giddy prowess, the eldest born of beings when Devas and Daityas churned for nectar. He chokes the throat of Siva and distresses everyone of mortal frame. At the merest. fall of his glance, virtue at once becomes (non-existent) like a burnt-up cloth. He wanders about in guile as a veritable embodiment of sin, who leads (every one) to tho darkest hell.

 He (Kali), who is an enemy of everything good, is the thorn on the rose, is the poisonous serpent on the sandalwood tree, is the moss on ponds, and is the great bitterness of the briny sea. He represents injustice in the monarch, the wicked heart of the soft-eyed woman, and the illusion warping the Truth of the scriptures.

 He is an ocean of wicked attributes, a personification of all that is opposed to good, and a renegade from Haree's foot. He is to be offered up as a victim to the Vaishnava Fire, called Bheema, kindled by the windy fuel of king Drupada's daughter.

**Champaka—**It is indeed for this reason that he fell, when the hill Govardhana was touched by Krishna's hand.

Mad like a roaring elephant, and rushing fast soiled with blood-red mire, she exhibits the divine punishment to the wicked by submerging fields of plantation.

**Matali.—**Meadows transformed into lakes are convulsed by waves, like a sea. They implore your mercy, along with the trees, by the latter falling prostrate at your feet. The pregnant cocoanut tree, laden with the full weight of fruits, is bent down; the tufts of her hair being torn by the force of the storm, she cries out piteously, up in the sky. The sun remains concealed behind the network of darkness caused by the clouds. All classes of animals are stricken sick and disheartened by longing for him.

The people of Vraja appear sorely distressed by the deluging flood of waters. Doves and young pigeons are bewailing aloud, having left their nests, because of sufferings caused by the expulsion from their home (of nests) and of the influence of passion. Alas! excellent cows are wandering about in herds in the woods with ears erect and bellowing for calves gone out of sight.

Enough, enough, with the creations and enjoyment of mansions, com pounds, and pleasure groves, fresh ones after fresh. Enough with the zest of admiration at the physical features of courtesans like Menaka, Rambha and others, and (enough) with the festivity of beholding the dance infamous with the gesticulated action of their arms and feet: enough, O quite

enough with the preeminence of sovereignty in the position of Devendra. I have been well taught a lesson by the experience of Jayanta. There are indeed thousands of men wandering on the Earth like Jayanta, who have their hearts over powered by the beauty of feminine form, face, nose, cheeks, ears, forehead, and eyebrows, and whose entire life-time is taken up with imagining the blue-lotus, red lotus, the Kunda flowers, the cloud, the moon-disc and so on, as fit objects of comparison to them. This act of Chitrangee is a lesson to the world, and possessing Thy approval is submitted to impacitly.

  I don't mind the little pang suffered by me on account of my son. The agony of separation was undergone by Dasaratha

when Raghunatha, the preeminent jewel of the solar race, was sent by him to the jungle—one who possessed an auspicious form of darkish-white, so lovely as to enchant the world—a veritable ocean of goodness—the Seetha's Lord. My son is no Ramachandra, nor is he an embodiment of (pure) Intelligence and Bliss.

 Blessed indeed are the inhabitants of Brindavan who enjoy the utmost beatitude of Thy direct presence (proximity). This is Thy sport. Thou sported as a Fish in guise, grown so big, swimming in the watersof deluge as to swallow the world. Thou upheld the world along with the Mandara mountain in the Tortoise-form when the sons of Aditi and Diti churned the mountain Mandara. Thou killed Hiranyaksha and

secured the collection of Vedas as a Boar of limitless prowess, deified by the vedas. Thou roared in the ( royal) hall as a manlion and saved Prahlada, the son of Kâyadhu. Thou begged as a liliputian Vamana for the three worlds (as alms) on my account. Thou assumed incarnation as Sri-Rama of inviolable pledges, by listening to whose life read out, the highest good resalts (to us), as poets say. If at all I deserve, grant (unto me) an interview of Thyself-of Thee holding high a lofty hill serving as an umbrella whose external circumference is radiant with pearly garlands consisting of lines of waterdrops suspended therefrom—of "Thee playing upon a flute set on the lower lip, from whose holes emerge the tunes of Vedas".

 Lord, when is my liberation to be? I amexhausted by a ceaseless circumlocution on the wheel of time. I bow, and implore emancipation of Thee, the wielder of the wheel. That wheel of the Universe is rotating with an immeasurable (vast) circumference, possessing an axle-box called Narayana that constitutes the womb of Universal Providence, to which are riveted endless millions of radias-spokes consisting of countless individualities in the universe, animate, inanimate, and so on, —a wheel that possesses heaps of luminous orbs such as the sun, moon, and the starry hosts, revolving within inner and inner orbits, that abounds with inner revolutions caused by the exits and entrances (of mortals) in the form of births and deaths again and again, as brought on by the seed

Thus shines the wheel, governed only by Thymandate. I long for rest near Thee, after surmounting the fatigue caused by such a rotation.

 What need to dilate? I bow to Thee, Vasudeva. I long to see One who shines as a sun with regard to the Lotus-countenances of Vraja's damsels, whose soft figure shines as a combination of the sun, moon, and the night, residing together—whose facial lotus

**Indra—***(Observing Champaka and Yagnacharya.)*

Sir, whither are you journeying?

**Yagnacharya—**Yonder, not far away, He who is the refuge of all Vraja's inhabitants is present: we are only going to Him.

**Indra—** Have many people gone there before?

**Yagnacharya—**All pious men.

**Indra—** How is that?

**Yagnacharya—** Being under delusion, I sent a letter to Indra about certain irregularities connected with sacrifices. More deluded than myself, Indra became foolish with conceit, and prepared for war, imagining himself the Supreme god. It is learnt that honoured Yadunandana (Krishna) completely disgraced him.

 I bow to you, O, father ; by the Lord's grace, I have become blessed and worthy. A woman's curse turned out the means of salvation to me, by the kindness of Prana's Lord.

 I lifted up the great and heavy Govardhana hill from the ground, with both hands and with considerable difficulty, and hold it high. These boys tickle me at the sides with (their) fingers.

 I am an Indra (king) only of Devas, but Thou art an Indra of "Gows" (words, cows, worlds, &c.) Hence all men praise Thee as Govinda that is perpetual.
