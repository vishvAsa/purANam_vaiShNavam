### Foreword
We are very pleased to provide to our readers the publication en- titled Praise-Poems to Vişnu and Śrī: The Stotras of Rāmānuja's Immediate Disciples by Nancy Ann Nayar. While the philoso- phy of Rāmānuja has been widely studied, the thought of this il- lustrious Acarya and his position within the Śrīvaiṣṇava sam- pradaya cannot be well understood without reference to the works of his immediate disciples and companions. Unfortu- nately, these compositions have been almost entirely ignored out- side of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition itself. For this reason, it has been a long-standing desire of mine to see the stotras of Kūresa and Parāśara Bhattar translated into English. The stotra poets quote the Upanisads time and time again; scholars of the Vedas will be interested to see the creative ways in which the philoso- phy of these timeless texts appear in poems of praise directed to the main deities of major Vaiṣṇava temples in Tamil Nadu.
Dr. Nancy Ann Nayar worked with the members of the Anan- thacharya Indological Research Institute's staff for a period of nine months in 1986-87, during which time she translated the Sanskrit poems and began the study of the Tamil language. Her Ph.D. dissertation (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) theological analysis of the stotras -- was published in 1992 by Otto Harrassowitz in Wiesbaden, Germany, under the title Poetry As Theology: The Śrīvaiṣṇava Stotra in the Age of Ramanuja.

The work of Dr. Nayar is a major contribution to the study of Śrīvaiṣṇavism. It especially bridges the gap between Rāmānuja and his contemporaries, on the one hand, and the later Acaryas on the other. The major concepts of Śrīvaiṣṇavism

such as
prapatti (salvation by surrender to God), the position of Laksmi as puruşakāra (mediator between the Lord and souls), and kainkarya (servitude to the Divine Couple) -- are found in abun- dance in these stotras. Hence this translation of the hymns of

Kūresa and Parāśara Bhaṭṭar provides valuable information for scholars.
We sincerely hope that this volume will stimulate interest in the important formative years of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. It is a most valuable contribution both for those scholars who have ac- cess to the original Sanskrit compositions, and for the general public interested in learning more about the theological and de- votional aspects of South Indian Vaiṣṇavism.
Thanks are due to the Manager and staff of All India Press, Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, for bringing out the book neatly and promptly.

In the preparation of this volume, I am deeply indebted to Dr. K.K.A. Venkatachari, who is simultaneously Director of the Ananthacharya Indological Research Institute and Professor at the University of Bombay. During my stay in Bombay from October 1986 to June 1987, he assisted me in the translation of the stotras, especially concerning problems regarding Śrī- vaiṣṇava idiom and semantics. He was also helpful in the diffi- cult task of identifying phrases and images which were rendered into Sanskrit from their Tamil antecedents, the hymns of the Āļvārs. Our visits to the major Śrīvaiṣṇava shrines praised in the stotras the Srirangam Temple in Tirucci, Alakar Kōyil outside Madurai, and Varadaraja Swami Temple in Kañcīpuram (all in what is now the state of Tamil Nadu) -- added substantially to my appreciation for, and sensitivity to, the many attractive de- scriptions of Vişņu's iconic incarnations and His terrestrial dwelling places contained in the stanzas.

Thanks are also due to Dr. V.V. Gangal and Pandit K.K.C. Laksminarasimhan for their assistance in the preparation of the initial draft of the translation of the stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar. Furthermore, Pandit Laksminarasimhan instructed me in the Tamil language during my stay in Bombay. Professor Richard Hayes of McGill University helped me in the translation of one particularly problematic stanza.
I am grateful to the Shastri Indo-Canadian Institute for a fel- lowship which financed my trips to and stays in Bombay and Tamil Nadu during 1986-87.
I would like to express my appreciation to Sister Noella Bolduc, m.c.c.c. and all of the members of the MECUM Con- templative Christian Community for their prayers and friendship over the past eight years of research and writing, including Johanne Auger, Grace Fournier, Linda Friedland, Suzanne Jonas,

Each of my daughters Sheila, Kamala, and Sunita has contributed in her own way to my work, and I am grateful to all three for their help in the preparation of this volume. Sheila ad- vised me regarding the format of the individual stanzas, and all of her recommendations were accepted. Kamala was particularly helpful during the study which preceded the undertaking of this project; she also discussed with me some of the theological is- sues raised by the poems. Sunita, too, was supportive, and en- couraged me in my study of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition.
Above all, I want to express my gratitude to my husband, Baldev Raj. He meticulously and uncomplainingly edited the fi- nal draft of the manuscript. His perseverance as a research scholar and his ethic of hard work have been an inspiration to me. Ever encouraging throughout the long time of research and writing, he provided continuing support which is what enabled me to complete this project.

Introduction
The well-known Visiṣṭādvaita philosopher-theologian Rāmānuja (c.1107-1137) is regarded by the members of his Śrīvaiṣṇava community as their chief intellectual leader and teacher (Acārya). Among the extant compositions of Rāmānuja's immediate disciples and Śrīvaiṣṇava contemporaries are ten praise-poems or stotras. Given the close relationship of their authors with Rāmānuja, one of the most important Hindu thinkers of all times, it is indeed surprising that until now only a few of these 716 stanzas have been translated into English. This present volume, then, consists of a translation of the complete stotra collection of the Acārya-philosopher's immediate disciple Kūresa (Tamil, Kūrattāļvān) -- referred to in the earliest hagiographical texts as Rāmānuja's favourite disciple -- and Kūresa's son, Parāśara Bhaṭṭar, who was one of Rāmānuja's immediate successors in an Acarya or guru line which extends up to the present day. Importantly, the stotra verses themselves substantiate Kūresa's close relationship with Rāmānuja, as well as Bhaṭṭar's position of leadership within the community of Śrīvaiṣṇavas centred in the Tamil-speaking area of South India --worshippers of the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa Who is eternally accompanied by His chief consort Śri-Laksmi.
The word stotra (synonymous with the equally familiar terms stava and stuti) is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root stu meaning "to praise, to laud, to extol, to celebrate". Among the oldest of Hindu literary genres, its origins go back to the Rg Veda. Important in pan-Indian Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jain- ism, the stotra has played an especially important role in the devel- opment of the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition. Kūresa's and Bhaṭṭar's sto- tras are particularly fascinating documents because, considered collectively, they are the first extant compositions that reveal the

Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śri
distinctive Śrīvaiṣṇava world-view; indeed, they contain a unified theological vision based on an intricate and selective blending of the three streams of scripture sacred to Tamilian Vaiṣṇavas: (1) the Sanskrit Veda and its auxiliaries, the Śāstras, the Purāņas, and the Epics as interpreted by Rāmānuja, (2) the Tamil Veda, comprised of 4000 Tamil verses collectively known as Divya Prabandham, composed by twelve Vaiṣṇava devotees who lived from the 6th to the 10th century C.E. (ten of whom are referred to as Ālvārs, or "those immersed in God"), and (3) the Pāñcarātra Āgamas, San- skrit texts containing chapters on cosmology, meditation, iconog- raphy, and temple construction and ritual.
Significantly, praise-poems or stotras are found in all three streams of Śrīvaiṣṇava scripture; therefore, they served as an ideal medium for the initial synthesis of these three strands during the crucial formative years of the tradition. Elements from all three streams of scripture, which form the theological foundation under- lying the stotras of Kūresa and Bhattar, appear therein as an INTEGRATED AND UNIFIED THEOLOGICAL VISION, as has been clearly demonstrated at some length in my in-depth analysis of the stotra collection entitled Poetry as Theology: The Sri- vaiṣṇava Stotra in the Age of Ramanuja (1992). The intensely emotional nature of the Alvar poets' devotion -- their unique con- tribution to Hindu religiosity (Hardy 1983) -- was assimilated into the Śrīvaiṣṇava community's Sanskrit literature through these early stotras composed during the very lifetime of Rāmānuja. The way in which categories and terminology from the Vedanta are joined with an emotional religiosity founded on the Alvārs is, in- deed, fascinating.
The function of the ancient and important literary genre of the stotra is, however, multidimensional. Liturgically, the stotra ap- pears to have played an increasingly important role in Southern Vaiṣṇava temples, a development that must be connected with the emotional tenor of temple religion in the Tamil lands (Nayar 1992:22-23). Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar composed hymns dedicated to Vişņu's most beloved iconic incarnations, such as Lord Ranga (and His consort Śrī) of the Srirangam Temple in Tiruccirapalli,

Introduction

Lord Varadarāja at Kāñcīpuram, and Lord Sundara (Tamil, Alakar) of Alakar Kōyil outside the famous city of Madurai. In each case, these hymns are recited even today in their appropriate temples as an integral part of Vaiṣṇava temple ritual. Kūresa's en- tire hymnal, collectively referred to as Pañca Stava, is chanted monthly in the temple of his hometown of Kūram, a village not far from Kañcipuram.
Śrīvaiṣṇavas regard stotra recitation as an effective means of obtaining boons, such as the cure of diseases, the birth of a son, the restoration of mental health, or even the attainment of knowl- edge. Bhaṭṭar's commentary on the "thousand names of Viṣṇu", which he identifies as a stotra, contains a lengthy explication of the efficacy of the chanting of the names of God, an efficacy which stotras as a genre are generally believed to possess. According to Bhaṭṭar, however, the stotra fulfills its function most distinctly when it is recited purely out of devotion, and for no ulterior pur-
pose.
The chanting of stotras as a form of personal devotion is an im- portant feature of Śrīvaiṣṇava spirituality. In this tradition of emotional devotion, the religious sentiments fostered by the chanting of praise-poems are certainly important. Yet the objec- tive efficacy of stotra recitation is equally significant. According to Visiṣṭādvaita epistemology, there are three means to valid knowledge (pramāṇa): direct perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), and verbal testimony (śabda). Recollection or remem- brance (smrti) is a. sub-category of perception. Among the exam- ples of recollection listed in the important Visiṣṭādvaita handbook called Yatindramata Dipikā is the spontaneous remembrance of previously-perceived sacred places, such as Śrīrangam, and the recollection of the lovely, divine, auspicious iconic form of Śri Venkatesa (divya-mangala-vigraha-smrti) while thinking deeply (1.19). Thus the recollection of particular iconic incarnations is, according to Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding, a form of the direct per- ception (pratyakṣa) of God. Correspondingly, among Śri- vaiṣṇavas an important function of the recitation of stotras, with their graphic descriptions both of God and His terrestrial dwelling

Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śrī
places, is the stimulation of the remembrance of particular iconic incarnations of Lord Visņu, leading to valid knowledge of God.
The Stotras
The stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar contain a wide variety of types of verses. Apart from the many stanzas of interest to students of Vaiṣṇava theology, there are verses that reveal something of the social milieu in which they were composed, and others that sub- stantiate hagiographical stories concerning their authors and Rāmānuja. Likewise, many stanzas give us a glimpse into the per- sonal religious experience and the deep devotion of their poet-au- thors. Because genres of biography and personal reminiscences were unknown to the Hindu literary world of the 11th-12th cen - turies, this, in itself, makes the stotras valuable documents.
A basic understanding of the Śrīvaiṣṇava conception of God is necessary for the comprehension both of the structure and content of these poems of praise -- all celebrations of God's gracious con- descension and accessibility. One of the most distinctive features of Śrīvaiṣṇava theology is expressed in the doctrine of the five forms or modes (pañca-prakāra) of Viṣņu, no one of which is more fully God than the other: (1) Para is the Śrīvaiṣṇava techni- cal term for Vişņu Who, in His transcendent form, dwells in the Supreme Heaven of Vaikuntha; (2) Vyūhāvatāra denotes Vişņu's four-fold creative cosmic emanation; (3) Vibhavāvatāra is the term by which Śrīvaiṣṇavas refer to Vişņu's occasional incarnations limited to specific times and places, the most popular of Whom are Rāma and Kṛṣṇa; (4) Antaryāmin is Vişņu as Indweller of the entire cosmos, and especially as present in the human heart; and (5) Arcāvatāra, the central focus of Śrīvaiṣṇava devotion, is the technical term for Vişņu's incarnation as a worshippable icon. One especially significant feature of South Indian Vaisnavism is that each iconic incarnation has a unique identity which is at all times maintained.

Introduction
Śrīvaikuntha Stava (ŚVS)
5
Regarded by Śrīvaiṣṇavas as Kūresa's earliest composition, Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha, as its title suggests, is a eulogy of Vişņu's Highest Heaven called Vaikuntha. As such, it contains numerous stanzas in praise of God's supernal, transcendent form (para). Heavily influenced by the Upanisads and continuous both with the philosophical and devotional writings of Rāmānuja, its basic structure is the following:
Kūresa lauds his Acārya Rāmānuja and Nammāļvār (vs. 1-3), offers introductory verses in praise of Viṣṇu and Vaikuntha, and bemoans his inability to adequately laud such lofty subjects (vs. 4- 10).
Following the epistemology established by Ramanuja, Kūreśa considers the valid means to knowledge with reference to Vai- kuntha in vs. 11-18. Then, in the section extending from v. 19 to v. 38, Küreśa establishes Viṣṇu's essential lordship, citing a num- ber of Upanisadic statements, and refutes a variety of schools of thought regarding the nature of Viṣṇu's creatorship and His rela- tion to the world.
In vs. 39-48, Kūresa extols Vişņu's Supreme Heaven known as Vaikuntha, and in vs. 49-64, following his Acarya Rāmānuja's philosophy of God, he praises the auspicious qualities of the Lord, and the specifics of His creatorship. He gives us a definition of liberation in v. 65.
In the next fifteen verses, heavily influenced by Yamuna's Sto- tra Ratna and Ramanuja's Vaikuntha Gadya, the poet praises the beautiful form of the Lord, including His weapons, attendants and consorts. The remainder of the poem consists of passages of ex- traordinary self-abasement and reflections on the author's unwor- thiness. This lengthy section is followed by three concluding verses consisting of prayers invoking the Lord's protection.

6
Atimanuşa Stava (AMS)
Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śrī
Poem in Praise of the Superhuman [Activities of God] consists of 61 stanzas extolling Visnu's occasional incarnations. Love of paradox, hinted at in Kūresa's other poems, is a central feature of this important and "typically Śrīvaiṣṇava" work, replete with hu- mour and irony. Kūresa's own enjoyment of the tension between the incomprehensibility and imperceptibility of Viṣṇu's supernal form and the vulnerability and radical accessibility visible in His many occasional incarnations forms the unifying feature of the poem. The poet's aim is less the exploration of the theological or philosophical implications of this tension than the relish of the po- larity inherent in God's essential nature: the very God Who is "completely invisible and unable to be apprehended by speech or mind" (v. 8) condescends to complete vulnerability as Kṛṣṇa, who was "bound with a rope" (vs. 36, 40), stole fresh butter in Vraja (v. 35), and became "a laughing stock for the cowherdesses” (v. 38).
After a stanza introducing the topic of the stotra, Kūresa contin- ues his poem with several stanzas in praise of the Lord's iconic in- carnation in the Śrirangam Temple (vs. 2-4). The significance of this should not be overlooked. The stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar contain many stanzas which express a passionate longing for God's presence and for surrender to Him, stanzas uniformly di- rected to one or another of Viṣṇu's iconic incarnations. By way of contrast, stanzas in praise of God's occasional incarnations are considerably more restrained. Following the several passion-filled verses directed to the Lord at Srirangam -- God's most accessible form as arcāvatāra -- Kūresa's praise moves in typical Śrīvaiṣṇava style from the most accessible form to the least. Kūresa lauds Visņu's occasional incarnation (as Vamana in v. 5), His four-fold creative cosmic emanation in v. 6, and His transcendent form as Lord of Vaikuntha in vs. 7-8.
In the theologically important stanzas 9-10, Kūresa explores the necessity for and wonder at God's accessibility in His various in-. carnations. Verses 11-16 include an unrelated variety of stories

highlighting the accessibility of the Supreme Lord, leading to the large main section of the hymn. The poet delights in the paradox of Viṣṇu's incarnations as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa -- stanzas composed in a teasing mood (vs. 17-58). We see the devotee Kūresa at his best in these verses expressive of intimacy with God. The last three stanzas of the hymn's main section extol a variety of Viṣṇu's "superhuman" activities. Kūresa then concludes his poem with a three-stanza reflection on his helplessness and unworthiness be- fore God, taking courage only because of the Lord's unbounded compassion.
Sundarabahu Stava (SBS)
Of Kūresa's five stotras, Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord] has been most directly influenced by the Tamil poems of the Alvārs. Composed in Vanagiri (known in Tamil literature as Tirumaliruñcōlai) during a period of its author's separation from his Acārya Rāmānuja due to troubled times in Srirangam (vs. 129- 31), the poem contains translations into Sanskrit of numerous Tamil epithets of God and place. The very names Sundara and Sundarabahu are translations of the Tamil epithets Alakar and Cundarat toluṭaiyan, employed by several Āļvārs.
Much of the general imagery and certain aspects of the structure of this praise-poem are based on the Ālvārs, as well. Numerous phrases, and in one instance an entire stanza (v. 92), are render- ings from the Tamil Ālvār poems. One reason for such heavy Āļvār influence is undoubtedly the fact that five Divya Praban- dham poets (Puttat Āļvār, Periyāļvār, Āṇṭāl, Tirumaṁkai Āļvār, and Nammāļvār) composed verses celebrating the beauty of this particular iconic incarnation of Viṣņu and His environs.
After the initial verse of Sundarabahu Stava, in which the poet honours his Acarya Rāmānuja and establishes the poem's subject and purpose, Kūresa moves directly into the praise of the auspi- ciousness and loveliness of Lord Sundarabahu and His terrestrial dwelling place (vs. 2-13). Praise of the Lord through the extolling

Praise-Poems to Viṣṇu and Śri
of His Vanagiri abode continues on and off throughout the re- mainder of the stotra. Stanzas 24-32 laud the auspicious qualities of God, while His beauty is the special subject of vs. 33-38. A part-by-part description of the body of Sundara, starting with His head, begins in v. 39 and continues through v. 68. Here we see the frequent use of poetic metaphors common to both Sanskrit and Tamil love poetry.
The consorts and attendants of the Lord in Vaikuntha are the subject of vs. 69-80, with special reference to the transcendent form of God (para), extending through v. 83. Beginning in v. 84, in a style similar to that of the Alvar hymns, Sundara is praised for having made Himself accessible in His various occasional incarna- tions.
Sundara of Vanagiri is linked to the three main Śrīvaiṣṇava holy places of Venkata Mountain (Tirupati), Hastiśaila (Varadarāja Swami Temple in Kāñcīpuram), and Śrīrangam in vs. 117-19. The remaining stanzas consist of Küresa's reflections on his own unworthiness, the Lord's compassion, and a series of historically significant personal petitions to Lord Sundara.
Varadaraja Stava (VRS)
The 102 stanzas of Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King are directed to the main icon in the Varadaraja Swami Temple, lo- cated in the famous temple town of Kañci. According to Śrīvaiṣṇava hagiography, the stotra was composed by Kūresa at the behest of his Acārya Rāmānuja as a means of requesting the restoration of Kūresa's vision, lost when he was blinded by a Śaiva king who was persecuting Vaisnavas. As the story has it, when Kūresa reached verse 23 he requested the Lord to provide divine (aprakṛta) vision by which he might see God's glory for- ever, and he was granted the ability to see Lord Varadaraja and Rāmānuja. (Kūresa himself refers to Lord Varadaraja as having restored the sight of "more than a hundred people" in SBS, v. 126.)

Introduction
9
The main epithets of both place and deity in this stotra are based on older Tamil names, even though the shrine itself was praised for certain only by a single Alvar, Puttat, in two verses addressed to "the One Who dwells in Attiyur" (see n. 1). According to local legend, the site of Varadaraja Swami Temple in Kañci is associ - ated both with the elephants that Hindus believe to be the guardians of the four directions -- which are said to have wor- shipped Visņu on the very spot where the temple was later con- structed -- and with the lord of elephants Gajendra, much loved by the Āļvārs. Kūresa frequently refers to the sacred site as Hastigiri/ Karigiri (Elephant Hill or Hill of the Elephant(s). Replete with imagery common to both Sanskrit and classical Tamil love poetry, Varadaraja Stava contains many stanzas important to the under- standing of Śrīvaiṣṇavism's theology of incarnation.
Vs. 1-14 celebrate the visible presence on Elephant Hill of the Supreme Lord about Whom the Vedas speak. Beginning in v. 15, Kūresa moves on to the praise of Vişņu's four-fold creative cos- mic emanation (vyūhāvatāra) (vs. 15-16), and the Lord's innumer- able auspicious qualities (vs. 17-20). The main section of the poem consists of a forty-two verse celebration of Lord Varadarã- ja's loveliness, including a part-by-part head-to-foot description, based on imagery from the Alvārs and classical Sanskrit court poetry similar to that contained in Sundarabahu Stava, vs. 39-68.
A number of verses follow in which the poet expresses a sense of wonder at the Lord's need for, and dependence upon, His devotees. In his own typical fashion, Kūresa poignantly reflects upon his own unworthiness and sinfulness (vs. 72-88). In the final verses, he combines praise of the Lord's unbounded compassion with three stanzas concerning an unnamed petition (vs. 89-91), an expression of surrender to the Lord founded on His great mercy (vs. 91-92, 94-95), and the request to be forever His servant (vs. 96, 98). Kūresa's final resort in his appeal for God's mercy is his relationship with his teacher Rāmānuja, a member of the illustrious line of Śrīvaiṣṇava Acāryas, at whose feet he has taken refuge (v. 102).
10
Praise-Poems to Vişņu and Śri
Śri Stava (ŚS)
Kūresa's Praise-Poem to [the Goddess] Śri consists of only eleven stanzas. Chronologically, this poem stands midway be- tween the short compositions in her praise by Kūresa's predeces- sors (Yamuna's Catuḥ Śloki and Rāmānuja's short laudation of Śrī in his Śaraṇāgati Gadya) and his son Bhattar's longer and much more elaborate hymn to the Goddess called Śrī Guņa Rat- nakosa. Yamuna's and Rāmānuja's influence can be felt in almost every verse of Kūresa's praise-poem.
Supplemented by the stanzas referring to Śrī scattered through- out Kūresa's other stotras and by Bhattar's poem addressed to the Goddess mentioned above, Śrī Stava provides us with a good un- derstanding of the Śrīvaiṣṇava view of Śri at the time of the early Ācāryas.
Śrirangaraja Stava: The First Hundred Stanzas (SRRS I)
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrirangam I, the first of Bhattar's stotras treated here, is directed to the main icon of the great Srirangam Temple located near the modern city of Tiru- cirappalli. During the time of the Alvārs, Srirangam was already an important centre of Vaiṣṇava worship, and Nathamuni, first in the lineage of Śrīvaiṣṇava Acaryas, is said to have resided there.
Bhattar's stotra is unique among the poems of the early Acāryas in that it clearly depicts the temple layout, built according to the ar- chitectural requirements of the Pañcarātra Āgamas. Bhattar praises the temple's landscape before entering the temple proper and then, verse-by-verse, engages in a laudatory description of each shrine that he passes as he makes his way to the Inner Sanc- tum. Śrīrangarāja Stava is recited before the main icon in the Śrirangam Temple on festive occasions such as Brahmotsava.
The recitation of taniyans ("solitary" verses) in praise of the Āļvārs and Acāryas, strung together to form a guru-parampara or listing of the lineage of preceptors, is a required part of daily

Śrīvaiṣṇava spiritual practice. Customarily, one begins with one's own Acārya, one's Acārya's Acārya and so forth through the most revered teachers, such as Rāmānuja, Yāmuna, Nathamuni, and Nammāļvār, through Visvaksena and Śrī, clear up to Lord Viṣṇu Himself. While the official guru-parampara does not ap- pear to have been formalized until after Bhattar's time, he gives us a virtual listing in vs. 1-12 of the poem: his father Kūresa (v. 1), followed by his Ācārya Empār, Rāmānuja, Yamuna, Nāthamuni, Nammālvār, the Goddess Śri, and the Lord Himself. This section is followed by eight verses in which the poet bemoans his inability to adequately praise the Lord. With v. 21, Bhaṭṭar begins a twelve-verse eulogy of the environs of Lord Ranga's terrestrial abode, including several lovely descriptions of the island-town of Śrirangam and the Kāverī River which surrounds it.
As Bhattar begins his entry into the temple proper (v. 32), he honours the leaders stationed in each of the four directions who guard the temple from its outermost wall, and praises the temple as a whole in vs. 33-36. Beginning with v. 37, Bhaṭṭar salutes the gatekeepers in order to gain their permission to enter the temple (a custom followed by devotees even today), and then celebrates various parts of the complex, including the thousand-pillared hall and the lotus pool. In v. 41, as he approaches the shrine of the Alvārs, the poet asks these "ten persons" to take pity on him. Af- ter several more verses in praise of temple and town, he reaches the figure of Narasimha, and from there proceeds on to the shrine of the Acaryas (v. 48).
As Bhattar nears the Inner Sanctum, he praises the many atten- dants of the Lord that he sees along the way (vs. 50-57). The In- ner Sanctum and the Lord's and Śrī's ladies-in-waiting are de- scribed and extolled in vs. 58-62. The remainder of the stotra is comprised of verses in praise of Viṣṇu's and Śrī's iconic incarna- tions Who dwell within the Inner Sanctum. The beauty of the ut- the smaller, portable icon of the standing Lord used in festive temple processions -- is extolled in vs. 63-74, while the remaining verses praise the mula-bera -- the well-known immov-
sava-bera

Śrīrangarāja Stava: The Latter Hundred Stanzas (ŚRRS II)
61
Praise-Poem to the King [of the Universe] at Śrīrangam II is the most philosophical of the early Śrīvaiṣṇava stotras. After a gen- eral praise of Śruti and Smrti (vs. 1-4), Bhaṭṭar begins a series of occasionally humorous refutations of various philosophical schools of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Jaina traditions (vs. 5-16). Having reviewed the valid means to knowledge according to Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy (vs. 17-26), Bhattar begins his praise of Lord Visņu's auspicious qualities, including verses which care- fully define each of the Lord's famous "six qualities".
Beginning with the inaccessible and imperceptible transcendent God and moving through His increasingly accessible forms (in contrast to the structure of Kūresa's AMS), Bhattar praises the transcendent Lord para in vs. 33-37 and Vişņu's four-fold cre- ative cosmic emanation (vs. 39-40). After several verses on the creation of the universe (vs. 41-44), he moves to the praise of Vişnu's occasional incarnations and His accessibility as expressed in a variety of His earthly activities (vs. 45-73).
Important in the theology of arcavatāra, v. 74 forms a link be- tween the verses celebrating Vişņu's occasional incarnations and His incarnations as a temple icon (with special reference to Lord Śriranga). Beginning with v. 83, Bhattar reviews the variety of means to reach the Lord. The power of the Lord to effect the union of the "surrendered" devotee with Himself is celebrated in vs. 87-89, where Bhattar calls the Lord both "the means and the goal". The poet concludes with several verses of supplication and self-abasement which, at the same time, celebrate the Lord's pa- tience and compassion.

Introduction

Śri Guna Ratnakosa (ŚGRK)
In Jewel-Treasury of Śrï's Auspicious Qualities, a companion- piece to Śrīrangarāja Stava, Bhaṭṭar directs most of his stanzas to Śrī's iconic incarnation in the Śrirangam Temple. From a purely literary point of view, ŚGRK is perhaps the most attractive of the early Śrīvaiṣṇava stotras. Theologically, too, it is the most impor- tant of the early compositions on the Goddess Śri, for it contains (in more elaborate form than in the works of Yamuna, Rāmānuja, or Kūresa) the several elements which converge in the doctrine of Śrī as the essential mediator (puruṣakāra) between the Lord and
souls.
Bhaṭṭar takes refuge with Śrī, and praises her for her role in the creation, preservation, and dissolution of the worlds in the first two verses of the poem. Śri is then lauded for enriching the love- liness of her husband (v. 3) and for being the very basis of His supremacy (the later tradition calls this the doctrine of śrī-patitva). In vs. 5-8, according to the custom in Sanskrit stotra poetry, Bhaṭṭar laments his inability to laud Śrī appropriately, and pleads for her inspiration so that he might complete his praise-poem to her. Much of Śri Guņa Ratnakośa expresses the centrality of Śrī to the Śrīvaiṣṇava world-view; indeed, scripture itself is said to have as one of its main purposes the acclamation of the Goddess (for example, vs. 10, 12-14). Śrī's powerful glance -- the good- ness that it brings, and the deprivation that arises from its absence -- is a theme of many stanzas (for example, vs. 15-18). The very creation of Vişņu's Supreme Heaven and all the worlds are said to be solely for Śri's pleasure (vs. 19-22). Bhaṭṭar then extols Śri as Mistress of the Supreme Heaven of Vaikuntha, and praises her relationship with Viṣṇu and their inherent inseparability (vs. 23- 31).
In v. 32, Bhaṭṭar begins the praise of the auspicious qualities of the Supreme Couple, employing a variety of epithets in the voca- tive case, specifically mentioning Śri's iconic incarnation in Śrirangam. He appears thoroughly to enjoy comparing and con-

14
Praise-Poems to Visņu and Śrī
trasting the auspicious qualities of the masculine Lord Ranga and the feminine Śri in vs. 33-37.
Icon-makers are required to memorize v. 38, a description of Śrī in a sitting posture, because it gives the idea of how an icon of Laksmi must look (as she appears in Vaikuntha) when wor- shipped independently. Several of the stanzas which follow are the first in the tradition to highlight the erotic relationship between Vişņu and Śrī, its enjoyment by the devotees, and its relation to Śri's role as mediator between the Lord and souls (vs. 40-47). These verses draw heavily on the images of Sanskrit love poetry.
The relish that the devotee has for the presence of Viṣṇu along with Śrī, as well as their eternal inseparability which extends to Vişņu's descents to earth in incarnational form, is expressed in v. 48. The poet then praises several of these occasional incarnations (vs. 49-55). Bhaṭṭar concludes his poem with a celebration of the most beloved of all the Supreme Couple's forms, their incarnation in a worshippable temple icon (vs. 56-61).
Aṣṭā Śloki (AS)
Eight Ślokas is included in most published Śrīvaiṣṇava stotra collections. While stylistically the work resembles a stotra insofar as it is written in Sanskrit poetic verse and its final stanza is di- rected to the Lord, content-wise it is the forerunner of the impor- tant Śrīvaiṣṇava literary genre called the rahasya-grantha composed mostly in Maṇipravāļa, a synthetic form of Sanskritized Tamil, in explication of the three main Śrīvaiṣṇava mantras.

texts
While the three mantras are given to every Śrīvaiṣṇava during the initiation ceremony of pañca-saṁskāra, and their recitation is performed daily by members of the community, their elaborate meanings are taught only to those who express a desire to delve more deeply into the spiritual life. Because the meaning of Bhaṭṭar's Aṣṭā Śloki can best be ascertained in the light of the later rahasya-grantha commentaries, it has been suggested that

this cryptic poem is a summary of a pre-existing oral tradition (Mumme 1987:12).
Vs. 1-4 consist of an explication of the tiru-mantra: "Aum namo nārāyaṇāya" or "AUM! Homage to Nārāyaṇa!". Vs. 5-6 explain the meaning of the dvaya-mantra: “śrīman nārāyaṇa caraṇau saraṇaṁ prapadye, śrīmate nārāyaṇāya namaḥ" or "I take refuge in/with the feet of Nārāyaṇa Who is [eternally united] with Śrī. Homage to Nārāyaṇa Who is [eternally united] with Śri". Vs. 7-8 explain the carama-śloka, the words uttered by Kṛṣṇa (to Arjuna) in Bhagavad Gītā 18:66: "sarvadharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ saraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvā sarvapāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ”, or "Having relinquished all dharmas, resort to me alone as refuge; I will release you from all sins. Do not grieve".
Śrīranganatha Stotra (ŚRNS)
The brief work called Praise-Poem to the Lord [of the Uni- verse] at Śrīrangam appears to have been composed by Bhaṭṭar when he was away from his beloved home of Śrirangam. Several of its verses express the poet-Acarya's longing to see Lord Ranga once again (vs. 3-5). Interestingly, v. 8 confirms the hagiographical story of Rāmānuja's visit to North India.
Text, Translation and Notes
This translation of the stotras of Kūresa and Bhaṭṭar is based on the edition of their works contained in Stotramālā, edited by the Acāryas of Kāñci and published most recently in 1969. This edition is the most accessible to Śrīvaiṣṇavas today. Until as recently as the last century, original copies of the Acaryas' manuscripts were destroyed by fire or put into a river after a copy was made by a son or grandson. This procedure was not regarded as a destruction of the manuscript; rather, revered manuscripts were consigned to water or fire (both regarded by Hindus as pure

16
Praise-Poems to Visņu and Śri
elements) in order to prevent them from being mishandled or treated disrespectfully. In spite of this, however, a critical edition of the stotras has been deemed unnecessary for several reasons.
The Śrīvaiṣṇava community, close-knit and geographically well-defined, has an unbroken line of preceptors dating from its first Acārya Nathamuni (c. 10th century C.E.). Most of its litera- ture (other than the philosophical commentaries of Rāmānuja) until recently remained unknown to, and unread by, those outside the community. The problem of widely diverging redactions with dif- ferences reflecting social class or geographical region -- as exists in the case of popular pan-Indian texts such as the Epics and Purāņas -- is non-existent in the early Śrīvaiṣṇava sectarian litera- ture. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the texts were re- stricted to a small community with a relatively cohesive world- view (inspite of the later divisions within the community). Fur- thermore, the first printed editions of many Śrīvaiṣṇava texts (including the stotras) were made by traditional scholars beginning in the 19th century. At that time, most available manuscripts were consulted; in fact, the printed editions themselves often contain variant readings. The text of Stotramālā was in each case com- pared with the other extant published editions (see bibliography), but because only two discrepancies were of any theological signif- icance, I have chosen not to refer to the variant readings in the notes except in these two instances. With respect to all other stan- zas, I believe that the comparison of variant readings would create an unnecessary complication in these already complicated texts.
The Translation
Certain difficult decisions must be made in the preparation of any translation. The non-technical and fluid language of the stotra poems can be particularly problematic. I have mostly been con- cerned with the lucidity of the overall meaning of each stanza, rather than with the literal emulation of Sunskrit grammar. In places, words or phrases, especially compounds, have been rather

Introduction
17
loosely translated in order to avoid awkward constructions, which may be found to be frustrating to readers in English. While avail- able commentaries were sometimes consulted in order to establish the correct prose order of the verses, in some instances stanzas have been reconstructed in order to allow for a somewhat more natural flow to the English language. Hopefully, this has made for a translation that will appeal to an audience beyond Sanskritists and academics specializing in Hinduism who can, in any case, consult the original text.
It has been my intention to translate the verses, especially those which are renderings of Alvar phraseology, imagery and emotion, according to Śrīvaiṣṇava idiom. The particular format for the translated verses, which was recommended by Sheila Nayar, was adopted not because I believe that the translations themselves would qualify as "poetry" (many would certainly not), but because the breaking up of the verses into small units makes for a clarity and readabilty not found in many stotra translations up to now.
The Notes
Notes to individual stanzas are to be found at the end of each stotra; the endnote numbers correspond to the stanza numbers. I have made every effort to identify antecedents of the verses, in- cluding phrases and epithets from the Sanskrit Veda, the composi- tions of Ramanuja, the hymns of the Aļvārs, and the Pāñcarātra Agamas. The stotras contain many Upanisadic phrases and epi- thets; particularly well-known phrases or epithets (especially if contained in numerous Upanisads) have not been identified in the notes. For the identification or explanation of Sanskrit words and the names and epithets of deities, persons, and places, the reader
may refer to the Glossary.

Śrīvaikuntha Stava
1
I take refuge at the feet
of my illustrious preceptor Rāmānuja the sole ocean of compassion who because of passionate attachment to the gold of Acyuta's lotus-feet eternally considers all else as straw!
2
May we resort to Vakulabharaṇa's feet -- ornaments [decorating] the heads
of the elders adept in the Three Vedas, the eternal wealth of good people,
and an auspicious asylum
for those with no other refuge.
3
Victory to the ocean in the form of Parankusa
the divine abode of Acyuta
who has limitless greatness, is filled with a surging flow of the sap of love's essence
enkindled by the fetters of wonderful passionate feelings arising from devotion's power, and is a storehouse of precious jewels [resplendent] with the riches of the Vedas.

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuṇṭha
4
I extol that Foremost Splendour Whom [the wise] desire
for the sake of the world's great welfare
dependent upon Whom
are the heavenly abodes
Who is lotus-eyed,
without a second, knowable by Vedanta,
and beginningless!
5
May I see that Indescribable One Who
wears a golden garment
casts sidelong glances, boon-bestowing and cool
has hands reaching down to His knees
is black like a cloud
has long ears and a chest raised and broad
and is the bearer of Laksmi.
6
We announce the lofty status of being Vişnu [with Upanisadic phrases such as]:
the Truth Undecaying
the One without clan or class
the Invisible One
imperceptible, indescribable, and incomparable
the Controller of this world
which is smaller than an atom.
7
I think that the Abode of Vişņu
which shines perpetually
on the summit of the Vedas (Upaniṣads)
and on the heads of the Lord's exalted servants

1920
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
falls within the range of speech
of even people like me
because of [the Lord's] motherly affection
toward those who have taken refuge with Him!
8
Though fully aware of my own [ignorance]
I shamelessly utter words of affection
to the feet of Viṣṇu!
No one calls the water [of a sacred river] impure if lapped by a dog,
nor need the dog feel ashamed when overcome by thirst!
9
The magnitude of the qualities of the demon-destroyer God transcends speech and thought.
Just a tiny particle from those (qualities] would pacify my torment,
[for] even a drop of water from the ocean is sufficient [to satisfy]
a thirsty insect!
10
Men of ancient times
whose ecstatic speech was tender with love have praised You with mellifluous words O Enemy of Madhu!
My lowly speech
[seems to make] a mockery of their [sweet] sayings.

Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha
On the other hand,
Your forgiveness will find an object in my harsh language!
11
Your revered commandment
known as the Three Vedas
is accepted as the valid means to knowledge
of the supra-sensual,
while other means
[such as perception and inference] are faulty and [therefore] fallacious.
But the eternal [Triad]
is praised as flawless!
12
You are a hidden treasure for ALL people, obtainable by the meritorious
but difficult to reach for others!
The virtuous performers of meritorious deeds accepted the Triad in this matter,
but others
by practicing things contrary to the Vedas have fallen down [into viewpoints]
which fail to recognize Vedic authority.
13
The evil consequence of the actions
of wicked people
is made visible [by] the wonderful sport of fate!
Alas!
Those whose minds are
steeped in wrong philosophy

21
22
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
even [after] having taken [into account] the revered Śruti
[in the matter of deciding]
the meaning [of words]
are doomed!
14
What is the difference between
those who seek out a mirage [in the desert
in order to quench their thirst]
and are then devoured
by the wild animals [living there], and those who are fortunate enough [to reside] near a pond
but are killed by crocodiles?
Alas! [There is no difference!]
Both those who deny the authority of the Vedas and the followers of wrong philosophies
derived from it
go to limitless terrible darkness,
[for] You do not
cast Your glance
on [either of] them.
15
In the very same way that an object
may be clearly seen [only] in the sunlight,
so those with minds made flawless
by devotion to You
discern the meaning of Śruti
[using] acceptable aids such as logic and Smṛti sent forth by You to elucidate the Vedas.

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
16
Those devoid of devotion to Your lotus-feet
cannot correctly apprehend an object as it really is [because] a [jaundiced] eye
not treated with bile-killing ointment
is unable to perceive the whiteness of a conch even in the [sun]light.
23
17
We determine that You alone are the Supreme Lord a truth disclosed by hundreds of Vedic statements
which have as their chief aim
the exposition of reality,
by the power of Smṛtis
which conform [to the Vedas],
by true Purāņas
given to the exposition of the truth,
and by the wisdom of the knowers of the Lord.
18
Elsewhere some people accept
the popular understanding of [the epithet] "Isa" (lord)
and declare that [Śiva] is Lord.
They accept the Three Vedas
only in order to endow mere public opinion
with [Vedic] authority.
But with You, O Imperishable One,
the Triad is direct!
19
He Who is smaller than an atom and greater than the great

24
became the Soul of [all] people
and the Generator of the worlds.
Śrivaikuntha Stava
We pronounce You -- such as You are -- Supreme Lord
You Who are denoted by the syllable "A" which is the root of the sacred syllable AUM,
the very essence of the Vedas.
20
You are the Lord of souls.
There is no Lord other than You. You are the Overlord of the universe and its Final Goal.
O Nārāyaṇa! O Imperishable One! You alone are the transcendent God! Even Brahma and the other [gods] have obtained their very existence by Your glance.
21
You are the Eternal One,
without equal or superior, Exalted Glory,
the Ancient Man
living in the eternal and undecaying heaven,
the Generator of life,
and the Ground of this world.
O Supporter of the earth!
The Vedas celebrate You alone!
22
You are that thousand-headed man Whom they call the Lord

Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha
of past, present and future, and the One having no ruler [over Him].
Your abode is on the ocean, Your forms are limitless, and Your Queen is Laksmi
Mother of the three worlds.
23
In conformity with all the Srutis,
Puruşa Sūkta
which is the purifier of the whole world
and faultless like You
described You
Who are steadfast, unshakeable,
and the bearer of the
title of Nārāyaṇa
as Supreme Person and Lord.
24
That lordly bliss which [Sruti] has described as hundred-fold in sequential order [is comparable] to Your own [bliss] only if finally multiplied
beyond [the range of] speech and mind.
You, the Lotus-eyed One and the Person in the Sun, are here among the people a
the Inner Soul!
25
That which is regarded as the root cause [of all things] --
and is known
in the [Upanisadic] statements on creation
as "Brahman" or
"Sat"

25
26
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
by the word Atman, or as Tat -- Mahopanisad proclaims to be
Nārāyaṇa.
[Other Upanisads] beginning with Subāla have also followed this [same tradition].
26
What is understood in the Śrutis as
the Supreme Light
the Highest Truth
the Supreme Soul Brahman
and the Highest Entity
one Upanisad calls "Nārāyaṇa"
and another "the supreme status of Vişņu”.
27
Thus thousands of Upanisadic statements proclaim Your supreme essential lordship.
Moreover, while traversing the worlds
swallowing them
and spitting them out again, You didn't even take notice
of the difference between
a [tiny] insect and [the great lord] Brahmā!
28
The wise ones determine Your essential lordship by the glory of Your form
by Your Supreme Abode
by some of Your wonderful, appropriate deeds
and by other undisputed marks
[indicative of Your supremacy].

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
29
It is [well-known] to all people that she whose sidelong glance perpetually determines the sovereignty
of lords [like Brahma and Śiva] is [named] Śri.
People of eloquent speech
derive the etymology [of the name Śri
from the fact that]
she has taken refuge with You,
and call you the śrī of Śrī!
27
30
Despite the existence of Śruti,
on account of their adamant and baseless logic, some skeptics become deaf toward You
because of māyā's power.
--
That māyā created by You out of the three gunas - what amusement does it not provide for You, O All-Pervading One?
31
O Storehouse of eternal, blemishless, spotless, changeless, auspicious, true qualities!
These [deaf ones] have said
that You are constantly being born variously in [the form of] inanimate objects and worms, butterflies, elephants and other [creatures]!

28
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
32
This entire universe is manifested
because of Your glance
and were You not to cast Your glance
it would not appear at all.
It desires Your glance
in order to remain [in existence].
Thus in Śruti You alone
are referred to as the "world".
O Lord!
33
Śruti has decreed Your sovereignty such that the name like the form
--
of all things moving and non-moving
is dependent upon You alone.
Alas!
For sinners
this is a cause of delusion
regarding You!
34
Various [people] who are
even slight and momentary
recipients even of a fraction of Your glance
have acquired a dominion
[otherwise] unobtainable by humans.
Whichever [gods] have spoken of Your Supreme essential lordliness [are themselves called lords] in the Śrutis
on account of their association with Your glory.

Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha
35
Some deluded ones think that
the variety of eternal things
is by its essential nature
independent of You
and so they speak of Your sovereignty as limited.
But the Three Vedas declare
Your dominion uncircumscribed!
All things exist
36
because of Your will alone.
Some things
forever dear to You
are eternal.
[Among these] eternals Your auspicious qualities
are indeed a [good] example for us
[because] it is certain that
their inherent nature is one of
eternal dependence on You alone.
37
You are not only
the Cause of this universe
comprised of sentient beings (cit)
and insentient objects (acit),
O Imperishable One,
but also its Effect!
[Thus] the Upanisads forcefully proclaim
Your immutability
[as the quality] which reveals
the limitlessness of Your essential lordliness.

2930
38
Śrivaikuntha Stava
Those who understand [the meaning of] Śruti know that your divine glory is incomprehensible without indulging in unfounded arguments [which include such questions as]:
"With what instrument?
staying where?
taking what [as the material]?
and to what end
does the Lord create all this?"
The Cosmic Egg
39
covered by the seven elements is the abode of the fourteen worlds
and of Śiva and Brahmā; hundreds of eggs like that one
each subsequent one ten times [larger]
than the one before
have become [mere] playthings
for Your sport!
40
Created by Your own will for Your action of sport, these [eggs] represent
a minuscule fraction of an iota of Your glory.
Your Supreme Eternal Realm
is ever changeless
and transcends time.
41
That which [the wise ones] describe as
the Supreme Abode of Viṣṇu
or the Sky beyond darkness
which is lustre-filled

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
composed of the highest sattva eternal
the Ground of all Bliss
and very beautiful and wonderful they also proclaim as
Your Abode called Vaikuntha.
42
That eternal [place]
difficult to reach even for [gods]
such as Brahma, Śiva and Indra or for Sanaka and others
who delight in renunciation, which some [devotees] desire
as the resplendent [state of] union with the Lord, which is directly perceptible [by liberated souls] and is the most highly revered of all places, [the wise ones] proclaim as
Your Abode called Vaikuntha.
43
Phrases such as "with form"
"with multitudes of true qualities"
"with noble and sweet thoughts"
"with greatness" and "with the highest wealth"
when used to describe [the Eternal Realm as being]
"like this" [or] "like that"
show disrespect for the glory [of Vaikuntha].
44
On account of the greatness of that which is eternal and unacquainted with changes like growth, decay and destruction, the fruit of ritual actions
- impermanent and resulting in sorrow -- is mentioned in the Śrutis as insignificant.

31
32
Śrivaikuntha Stava
45
That [place] which can be reached by the pure,
by those who have transcended changes
like birth and old age,
by those who possess
the wealth of abundant devotion, and by those who are not attached
to worldly existence, and cannot even be imagined
by other less-fortunate ones, [the wise ones] proclaim as Your Abode called Vaikuntha!
46
The supreme greatness
of Your limitless Eternal Realm is established as independent of anyone other than You.
Multitudes of qualities
beginning with knowledge have crossed beyond all limits!
Your beloved Lakṣmi
and Your important attendants
such as the king of the birds (Garuḍa) [dwell there].
47
Your countless, limitless, true auspicious qualities
are such that even if one were to possess
a minuscule fraction of a bit
of a single quality from among them, the resultant glory would transcend speech and mind.

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
Yet You are One Whose glory is independent [of these qualities]!
48
[People who are considered great are judged so]
on account of their qualities.
Some gain respect
because of worldly power.
O All-pervading One,
with You it is precisely the contrary!
Your power and qualities attain auspiciousness on account of their association with You!
49
The Three Vedas declare You to be
without qualities
because You are untouched by
the material constituents
of purity, passion, and ignorance.
O Hari!
They proclaim You
the Supreme Lord of lords
because You are an Eternal Ocean
of all true qualities!
50
They say that knowledge itself
is Your essential nature
and also that knowledge is Your attribute
in the same way that a gem made of lustres has lustre itself as its quality.

33
34
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
Therefore, [having knowledge as a quality], You perceive the entire universe directly, and its protection is accomplished solely by means of Your glance.
51
By declaring in sequential order
"Those which are one hundred [times bliss]..." the Three Vedas attempted to delimit Your bliss which is augmented by
streams of Your qualities
beginning with youthfulness.
Ultimately they proclaimed [Your bliss] to be beyond the range of speech and mind!
52
Thus the ingenious [Triad] declared that the great majesty of all Your limitless glories
along with all Your auspicious qualities beginning with youthfulness
is beyond the range of speech.
53
Oh! What a wonder!
By Your wonderful action
at the time of the dissolution [of the worlds], controlling according to its appropriate merits the entire undifferentiated [universe]
which was ignorant
and without knowledge of past experience, You instantaneously effected its reappearance by Your vow to glance [in its direction] at once, [causing it to become] differentiated
from a [tiny] insect
clear up to [the great lord] Brahmā.

Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha
54
Such is Your limitless lordly power that with that selfsame glance
You set in motion the wonderful universe which ever moves toward appearance
growth, decay, and dissolution [and is differentiated by]
moving beings and non-moving things and also lords and beggars!

Since You are able to create the universe
destroy it, change it, make it non-existent
and determine change as to its form and nature, why do you take into account the law of karma [when the wise ones] declare
Your lordly autonomy indisputable?
56
They speak of Your splendour as darkening the brightness of the thousand-rayed [sun]
which collects together (its rays]
at the time of dissolution [of the universe].
Your perpetually playful and ravishing brilliance is ever well-disposed
toward those well-disposed to You
and is terrifying to [all] others!
57
[All] creatures are dependent upon Your glance for their very existence,
so You are already the possessor of everything!
I [can't] imagine another as munificient as You!

You [Yourself] are the temple of Indira
[the Goddess of Wealth]
so where is the need
to speak of Your riches?
58
Just look!
Seeking to uplift the creature
who seeks to drown in the sorrows
caused by sins arising from latent impressions [resulting] from birth after birth
in this beginningless transitory existence, solely out of compassion
You have prescribed in the Sastras
[the means for ] the expiation of those sins.
59
The spiritual well-being
which You fashion for Your creatures
by the eternal Śāstras
by Smṛtis
by the deeds of Your divine incarnations and by Your auspicious glance
is a wealth of bounding billows
belonging to the Most Excellent Ocean
that is Your compassion!
60
Oh! Alas! Do tell [me]!
What is this sin of inconceivable potency incessantly and constantly present in creatures
who have not fashioned for themselves
a fortunate destiny
that causes them to cross beyond

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
the ocean of Your compassion
[even though] it sports in overflowing its proper boundaries.
37
61
Here [in this transitory world]
a creature commits in half a moment sin [the effect of which is] inexhaustible even after the experience [of suffering] lasting for millions of eons.
Ah! How wonderful it is
that You always forgive such a sinner
in all [sorts of] births
solely because of a mere intention to stop [sinning].
62
How could so great a forgiveness fail
toward those who have a protective armour
in the form of hands folded
in supplication to You?
And how can Your forgiveness
be regarded as an auspicious quality
[when it proceeds] on its own
without distinction
toward all creatures zealously eager
for Your motherly affection?
63
When You [heard] the trumpeting
of the best among elephants [Gajendra], You Who created the universe by a mere thought
caused it to flourish,
and then desired to destroy it,

38
wanted to come [to him]
and stroke his foot!
Śrīvaikuntha Stava
What do you mean by surrendering
to such [feelings of] motherly affection?
64
Oh how wonderful!
If any creature in this transitory existence might worship the Lord ever so slightly
with an undivided mind,
You accept him on par with Garuḍa
even without knowing that
"He is [like] this,
He is endowed with such-and-such qualities, He is thus-and-so"!
65
You bestow upon those who have resorted to You
form and qualities such as glory
that are equal to Your own.
Some therefore say that liberation is
identity with You.
[But] in the highest considered opinion
of the learned
liberation is only
servitude to You!
Be that as it may!
66
Oh, what [a wonder that
You take on ] the nature and qualities

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
in whatever kinds and amounts they might be of whomsoever resorts to You.
With Your conduct dependent on [Your devotee and becoming] similar in qualities with him, You embrace him!
67
O God! For a hundred autumns
may we see You like this --
resembling a mountain of black collyrium having a prominent and attractive nose
long eyes, long-stretching ears
victorious arms [reaching down] to the knees
a chest [decorated] with the śrīvatsa mark and a navel broad and deep.
68
We praise this golden-cloth clad body which has lotus-eyes and lotus-feet
delightful finger-tips lovely like red lotuses
hair curls resembling (swarms of] bees
and a body-complexion [the colour] of black bees.
69
When will You favour me with
the amorous play of Your eyebrows
Your tender, cooling glance and gentle smile
Your speech [filled] with sweet syllables
and Your lotus-face
blossoming forth with fervent love?
70
When will Your pair of lotus-feet
with the marks of the thunderbolt, goad,

banner, lotus, conch, discus, female fish,
pot of nectar and desire-yielding tree anoint my head once again
with light spreading forth?
71
When will Your locus-foot
which in the strides of Trivikrama
traversed the three worlds, which is is a head ornament
for those having unsurpassed devotion and eternal wealth to me,
agree to [take its place upon]
my head for a long time?
72
Ah! When will You fulfill my desires
by placing on my head
the fine and tender young leaf of Your hand
which resembles a veined lotus
and is similar to a lotus
with fully-bloomed petals
so delightful to the senses?
73
Ah! The natural beauty of Your body alone is ever enough!
Even then there is more [to be enjoyed]!
[Your natural beauty] enhanced by [the loveliness of] Your ornaments becomes too much [to bear]!
Your abundant splendour in its entirety! Oh! [How can I speak about that ?]

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuntha
74
With unblinking eyes let me see You shining with the śrīvatsa [mark], kaustubha jewel,
crown and forehead mark,
with an armlet, a garland, and a bracelet of gold, with an extraordinary necklace, jewelled anklets, and with the knot of Your garment
[tied around Your waist]!

Your lovely complexion is like a blue lotus

[silver] like the moonlight

Bearing the beauty mutually,
[each part is enhanced] by the other.
When can my eyes
feast on You?

With my hands folded in supplication to You
and with wide-open eyelids
may I enjoy You Who
with conch and discus

78
Whatever is resplendent here [in this world] they call by the term " śrī"
[yet] beauty and splendour are only an infinitesimal part of [Your consort Śrī's] greatness.
[Learned people] indeed declare that she whom they call by the name of Śri
and whose dwelling-place they declare You to be is [herself] the attainment
of those engaged in [spiritual] striving.
79
She whom You obtained through Your exertion
in the churning of the ocean
and because of whose disappearance [as Sita]
You set out to destroy the world
delights You always with deep feelings
which have a continuous flow of
the extraordinary sentiment [of love] each and every moment!
80
May I, who approached You
with a feeling of exaltation [at being in Your presence]

85
Even after having forcibly conquered sin
purified the mind
shaken off all inauspiciousness
persisting from birth
and imbibed multitudes of true auspicious qualities,
still I am unworthy of Your feet
because [in spite of all this]
I have been submerged in this [sinfulness]
for a [too] long time!
86
But on the other hand,
what do I know [about Your mercy]!
You accept what is inauspicious [in Your devotees]
as if there is nothing preferable,
[solely] because of their association with You.

Poem in Praise of Śrivaikuntha
If You accept an individual thus,
then there is none worthier than he!
87
Because we did not become
the target of Your glances
we have fallen into the whirlpool of saṁsāra !
How can those such as we --
who have incessantly committed
thousands of sins in [a multitude of] births -
be worthy of Your compassion?
--
88
I have not at all accumulated [merit
based on] good deeds,
nor have I flawless knowledge; moveover, I am bereft of devotion to Your revered lotus-feet!
O Lord!
I am an [empty] vessel
fit [to be filled with] Your compassion!

What is the use of all this prattling?
Hundreds of thousands of times I have committed thoroughly

I am unable to advance toward Final Emancipation!

[But whether] I am able to get what I long for or whether obstacles prevent it,

NOTES
This stanza has become the official guru-parampară (lineage of Acāryas) verse in praise of Rāmānuja. As such, it is re- cited by all Śrīvaiṣṇavas, whether Tenkalais (Southern School) or Vatakalais (Northern School).
References to the Lord's and Śri's "sidelong glance" (ikṣaṇa or katākṣa) abound in Śrīvaiṣṇava praise-poems. Regarded in both Sanskritic and Tamilian culture as the "look of love", God's sidelong glance -- a glance from the corner of His eye -- connotes the passionate nature of His relationship with His devotees (as their Beloved), as well as the power of His glance. A straightforward glance or direct gaze would overwhelm the devotee.

This verse mentions several mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇas, or signs of a great man: long arms reaching to the knees, long ears, a broad chest, and so forth.
Vişņu is frequently referred to as "the bearer of Lakṣmi" (Lakṣmidhara), synonymous with His better-known name Śridhara. Theologically, this name is particularly significant for Śrīvaiṣṇavas: "Just as the gem bears its lustre, and the flower its fragrance... Viṣṇu bears Laksmi by an inherent [eternal] relationship" (see Bhaṭṭar, BhGD, No. 617). "clan" (gotra), "class" (varṇa).
"the water [of a sacred river]" (tirtham). The word "river" is implied in the verse due to the fact that other forms of water (such as water in a pot) would, indeed, become impure if licked by a dog.
"Of the demon-destroyer god" (devasya daitya-mathanasya) refers to Vişņu, Who is well-known as Madhujit and
Madhusudhana. For an extended etymological explanation of these epithets referring to Vişnu's role as the destroyer of demons, see Bhattar, BhGD, No. 210.
Visiṣṭādvaita philosophy recognizes three means to valid knowledge: perception, inference, and verbal (primarily scriptural) testimony. Because Vişņu's Supreme Heaven transcends perception by the senses, the Vedas alone (referred to here as trayi or Triad) can give us knowledge of
it.
PSV notes the following concerning "the meaning of
words": Nyaya teaches that a sentence carries meaning over and above the meanings of its individual words. The signif- icance in the context of this verse is that some people accept Śruti in principle, and discern the meaning of its individual words, but interpret its overall meaning wrongly; that is, they accept Śruti but not its overall meaning that Visņu is the Supreme God.
"Limitless terrible darkness" (aparaṁ ghoram tamas) is a poetic expression for hell (naraka), "a place of torment for the wicked where souls go before being reborn" (M-W, 520).

In this verse and v. 16, Kūresa clearly follows his Ācārya Rāmānuja's teaching on the relationship between devotion and knowledge. See Rāmānuja, VS, para. 144.
This verse is a continuation of v. 15.
51
In this stanza, Kūresa enunciates the view of his Acārya Rāmānuja called satkhyātivāda, or the theory of reality- apprehension. Rāmānuja reduces all the other five theories of perception (including akhyāti or non-apprehension, atmakhyāti, or self-perception, anirvacaniya-khāyti, or indefinable perception, anyathakhayti, or misperception, and asatkhyāti or non-being's perception) to two: an object which is manifest to consciousness through perception either corresponds completely to the thing as it is in reality (yathartha) or it does not. Rāmānuja's ŚrīBh deals with a number of exceptions which apparently contradict this realistic theory of perception, one being the yellow ap- pearance of white things to the jaundiced eye: "But in the (perception of the) yellow conch and other such things (by the jaundiced eye), the ocular rays combined with the bilious substance existing in the eye, are brought into association with the conch and other such things. The whiteness be- longing to the conch is not apprehended, because it is over- powered by the yellow colour belonging to the bile. Hence, as in the case of the conch-shell covered with gold, there is a perception that the conch is yellow. The bilious substance, and the yellow colour belonging to it, are very subtle and are not therefore apprehended by the bystanders. But, by him who is (thus) afflicted with biliousness, they are, though subtle, apprehended well, because they have proceeded from his own eyes...." (ŚrīBh I.1.1.1, p.167). This and all other excerpts from ŚriBh are based on the translation by M. Rangacharya and M.B. Varadaraja Iyengar, unless otherwise indicated.
In this verse, Küreśa, following Rāmānuja, links "the ap- prehension or knowledge of the thing as it is" (yathārtha- bodha) with devotion to the lotus-feet of the Lord (anghri- sarasi-ruha-bhakti). Devotion, which is likened to a bile- killing ointment, is the remedy for faulty apprehension.

Vs. 17-20 have as their object the praise of Viṣṇu's supreme lordship over all of creation. "Lord" (Isa) is popularly regarded as an epithet of Śiva. According to Kūresa's verse, people who accept this under- standing then go to the Vedas, and finding the name Isa there, claim that the Vedas conclude that Śiva is the Sup- reme Lord. The Vedas are thereby used to legitimize what is mere popular opinion. But in the case of Vişņu, the Triad is direct (sammukīnā, lit. "face-to-face").

"Smaller than an atom" (anoraṇu-tarah) and "greater than the great" (mahataḥ mahiyan) is taken from KUp 1.2.20: "this person, kept in the cave [of the heart], is even smaller than an atom (aṇoraṇīyān), and the great among the great" (mahatomahiyān).
24
This same Upanisadic passage was adapted by Tirumali- cai Alvar in Tiruccantaviruttam, v. 109: "There is none to make You small, but You became smaller, none to make You big, but You become bigger...O God of gods! The sages praise You thus, and I praise you also" (translation by K.K.A. Venkatachari).
"Expressable by the syllable 'A' which is the root of the sacred syllable AUM". Kūresa's interpretation is based on Rāmānuja, who “argues the supremacy of Nārāyaṇa on the basis of His being denoted by the letter 'A', which is the root of the sacred syllable Aum" (Carman 1981:165). The issue in vs. 20-24 is Visņu's supreme lordship over all other gods.
"Thousand-headed man" (puruṣaḥ...sahasra-mūrdhā) is based on PuSu (sahasra-sirṣa). See Bhattar, BhGD, No. 226.
"Lord of past, present and future" (bhūta-bhavya-bhavad- išam) is based on KUp II.1.5: "Lord of past and future" (iśānam bhūta-bhavyasya). See also Bhattar, BhGD, No. 291.
"Queen" (mahişi) is a term used for the Chief Queen, that is, the first or consecrated wife of a king.
Kūresa follows Ramanuja's interpretation in this stanza. "Bliss (ananda) multiplied beyond [the range of] speech and mind" is based on TaittUp 1.9.1. Ramanuja argues that this

Poem in Praise of Śrīvaikuṇṭha
25

53
Upanisadic passage "proceeds to give a definite measure- ment of the excellence of the Bliss of the Brahman in that order in which each succeeding bliss is a hundred fold of the bliss (immediately preceding it); and then speech and mind return from Him (without attaining Him) on account of that (Bliss) being incapable of (such) definite measurement”. According to Rāmānuja, “ānandamaya (or That which con- sists of Bliss) is different from the individual self, who is capable of existing in both the states of bondage and final release" (ŚriBh I.1.7.17).
"Inner Soul" (antarātma) is a reference to God as antar- yāmin, "Indweller" or the "Soul of the soul"; "Person in the Sun" (puruṣaḥ pauṣṇaḥ, lit. solar person). Both refer- ences are from TaittUp 1.8.5: "He Who is in [the heart of] a human being (puruşe) and He Who is in the Sun (āditye) are one and the same".
The pattern for the use of proof texts in this verse is based on Rāmānuja, who quotes a number of Upanisadic passages referring to Brahman, and then states: "By means of these and other similar passages, it is made out that Nārāyaṇa Himself, the Lord of all the lords, is the supreme cause. The words 'Sat' (existence), 'Brahman', 'Atman', which are all found mentioned in similar contexts, are particularized by the word 'Nārāyaṇa' occurring in a context similar (to the other above-stated contexts), and they reveal Him alone" (ŚrīBh II.1.6.15).
SuUp is an important proof text for Rāmānuja. The pas- sages which he quotes from the text often are those which name Nārāyaṇa. (See, for example, ŚriBh I.1.1.1 and II.1.3.9, and BhGBh XII.2).
"The Supreme Light" (jyotiḥ param), "the Highest Truth" (parama-tattvam), "the Supreme Soul" (parātmā) and "Brah- man" are all called "Nārāyaṇa" in MaNārUp.
Vişnoḥ padam paramam may denote either the Supreme Brahman Himself or His Supreme Abode of Vaikuntha ac- cording to Rāmānuja.
In this verse, Kūresa states that the supreme lordship of Viṣṇu, proclaimed in the Upanisads, is evident in His incar- nations as well.

The words "traversing the worlds" refer to the three steps taken by Vişnu's incarnation as Vamana the dwarf.
The act of Visnu's swallowing the worlds and spitting them out again is referred to by the Alvārs a total of 135 times. It occurs in the poems of all the Alvārs except Tonṭaratipoti's, and is one of the most frequently referred to episodes in DP (Ate 1978:380-81).
PSV glosses "other undisputed marks" of Viṣṇu with such phrases as: the quality of being the husband of Lakṣmi (lakṣmi-patitva), the quality of reclining on [Ādi]śeṣa (seṣa- sayitva), and the quality of having Garuda as vehicle (vainateya-vāhanatva).
This verse is connected with the immediately preceding ones in that śrī-patitva, or the quality of being the husband of Śri, is important for establishing the supremacy of the Lord. While Śrī obtains her high status as a result of her having taken refuge with Visņu, the position of this stanza in the group declaring the Lord's supremacy (vs. 17-29) implies the reverse as well. According to Śrīvaisnava theology, Śrī is one of the marks of the Lord's supremacy. For a history of the concept of śri-patitva, see Nayar 1992:229-32.
Kūresa says that the Goddess is named Śri "because she has taken refuge with [Vişnu]". According to this interpre- tation, the name Śri is derived from the Atmanepada or passive form of the verbal root śri meaning "to lean on, rest on...cling to, be supported or fixed or depend on...to go to, approach, resort or have recourse to (for help or refuge).... (M-W, 1098). The name Śrī may also be derived from the verbal root śrī meaning "to diffuse light, beauty, grace, loveliness, welfare, good fortune...auspiciousness...wealth, treasure, etc." (M-W, 1098).
"People of eloquent speech" are Valmiki, Tirumarkai Alvar, and Yamuna. See "śrī of Śri" in the Glossary.
For other examples of word-play on the name Śri, see SS, v. 7, SBS, v. 9 and 69, SRRS I, v. 66, and SGRK, vs. 12 and 29.
For a complete discussion of the five etymological deriva- tions of the epithet Śrī as found in Pañcaratra, see Vedanta Desika, ŚrīRTS, pp.427-36.

"skeptics" (kautskutāḥ), lit. "those who ask why? how?". PSV glosses the word with kutaḥ kutaḥ iti vadantāḥ. This verse and the following one (v. 32) are concerned with the philosophical statement implying the identity of the world and Brahman. V. 31 sets out the understanding of several philosophical schools, and v. 32 refutes that interpretation by stating why certain of the Upanisads appear to speak of Brahman as jagat or "world". Rāmānuja states that "It is the Brahman Himself, having all the intelligent and non-intelligent things for His body, Who is denoted by the word jagat" in ŚrīBh II.1.6.25.
The imagery found throughout these praise-poems which describes the world as being manifested on account of the glance of the Lord appears to be a poetic rendering of Rām- anuja's understanding of the complete dependency of the world on God.
Name and form in Advaita Vedanta are restricted to the ul- timately unreal realm of empirical existence, and are caused by (that is, are dependent on) māyā. According to Ram- ānuja, however, name and form are dependent on the Lord and, in fact, "are not limited to objects in the phenomenal world but are part of the distinctive nature of all entities, in- cluding the Supreme Entity, God Himself" (Carman 1981: 158).
Note Kūresa's sarcastic humor: the Advaitic belief that nāma-rūpa is dependent on māyā alone is ITSELF a delu- sion. Kūresa says that the Advaitins themselves are deluded concerning the truth that nama-rupa is dependent on the Lord!
Kūresa explains the secondary meaning (aupacārika) of the words "lordliness" (aiśvaryam) and "supreme lordship" (parama-iśitṛtvam) in this verse. Those who are in some way associated with the Lord share in His quality of lordli-
ness.
According to Kūresa and Ramanuja, souls are eternal entities and are dependent on the Lord, whereas the Nyāyikas say that only the five elements (pañca-mahā- bhūta) are eternal, and God creates all else.

According to Rāmānuja's philosophy, an entity can be both eternal AND dependent on the Lord. Kūresa attempts to reconcile this apparent contradiction by an analogy: the Lord's auspicious qualities are both eternal and dependent. "The [three-fold] Cause of the universe" is a reference to the Lord as the material, instrumental, and co-operant cause of the universe, according to the philosophy of Rāmānuja. This verse introduces the topic of Vaikuntha. Verses 41-45, meant to be read together, describe the Supreme Heaven. "the resplendent [state of] union with the Lord" (sayujyam ujjvalam).
Śrīvaiṣṇavas recognize several degrees of liberation. Only sayujya is the fullest possible union with the Lord. Kūresa has attempted to describe Vaikuntha in several of the previous verses, but here he retreats from being able to ade- quately describe it.
The ritual actions referred to in this verse are those per- formed for desired fruits such as wealth or heaven. Śrī- vaiṣṇavas regard these kamya rituals as inferior because of the temporary nature of their fruits.
Five categories of souls are mentioned here: (1) "the pure", or the eternally-free souls (nityas); (2) "those who have transcended changes like birth and old age", or the liberated souls (muktas); (3) "those who possess the wealth of great devotion", or the Lord's devotees on earth (bhaktas); (4) "those who are not attached to worldly existence", or those desirous of liberation (mumukṣus); and (5) "other less fortunate persons", which refers to all others.
"Those which are one hundred (times bliss]..." (te ye satam) is a quotation from TaittUp 2.8: te ye satam...te ye satam. See also SBS, v. 32.
"law of karma" (svabhāva-niyamam, lit. "the law of na- ture").
"[Means for the] expiation of that sin" (duşkṛtasya nişkṛt- im) refers to the ritual of repentance and confession (prayaścitta) prescribed by the Sastras and the Pañcarātra Agamas.

expression of intimacy which, in the compositions of Kür- eśa, often takes the form of teasing and bantering. The topic of this verse is God's incarnations. Compare with Rāmānuja, BhGBh 4:11, and see especially the explication of this passage in Young 1989.
"For a hundred autumns", a Vedic phrase indicating a very long time, is frequently found in these praise-poems. The Indian autumn, the pleasantest of seasons, noted for its clean, clear air, is identified with clear-sightedness.
The description of the Lord in this verse contains several "signs of a great person" (maha-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa). "with unblinking eyes" (animeşam, lit. "unblinkingly/un- winkingly"). The idea expressed by this word is that the loveliness of the Lord is so attractive that not a moment should be lost in the visual enjoyment of His beauty.
Similar listings of the Lord's ornaments are found in the writings of both Yamuna and Rāmānuja. Compare with SR, v. 36, BhGBh 4.34, and VaiGad, para. 5.
Verses 78-80 are to be read together. For word-play on the name "Śri", see n. 29.
The ordering of the three consorts Śrī, Bhūmi (Kṣamā), and Nilā -- as it appears in vs. 80-82 -- shows that at least by the time of Kūresa, Kṛṣṇa's cowherdess wife Nappinnai had been integrated into Sanskrit literature as Nīlā. See, for example, Poykai Ālvar, MTA, v. 42 in which the same ordering occurs "Śri and Bhū and the cowherdess girl" (tirumakalum maṇmakaļum āymakaļum). "The abode (or seat) of auspicious qualities untouched by all defects" (mangala-guṇa-aspadam asta-heyam) is clearly Kūresa's adaptation of one of Rāmānuja's famous and frequently used phrases. Compare with BhGBh 4.34: "O sole seat of auspicious qualities untouched by all defects" (nikhila-heya-pratyanika-kalyāṇa-ekātane). Similar phrases occur throughout Kūresa's stotras.
It is a commonly held Hindu belief that if at the time of birth the Lord's glance falls on a person, (s)he will have the desire for liberation.
It is not clear in the Sanskrit text whether the last line of this stanza is an exclamation or a question.

Vs. 91-95 describe the unbearableness of worldly miseries. Kūresa's description of life in the womb is based on the Purāņas. Contrary to Freudian thought, which views the womb as a place of contentment to which one might wish to return, the Purāņas describe it as a place of great suffering. See, for example, VP VI.5.11-16: "The tender embryo, surrounded by great filth, floating in water, distorted in its back, neck, and limbs, endures severe pain in the course of its development....unable to extend or contract its limbs...." "By/with horses in the form of sense organs" (indriya- hayaiḥ) is imagery based on KUp 3.3-6, esp. 4: "the senses, they say, are horses" (indriyāni hayānāhuḥ).

I choose [as my subject of praise] the occasional incarnations of Viṣṇu Who has far surpassed all comparison
with all ordinary people
by His superhuman character, conduct,

and by His power, and valour
exceeding [even] the gods!

May the light rays resembling a stream of honey-nectar
flowing out from the lotus-feet
of the One Who dwells
in auspiciousness-granting Rangam,
born of those [feet]
known from Śruti to be "a fountain of honey", bestow [on us] the auspiciousness
of [Vişņu's] Supreme Abode.
3
We bow down before
the King at Srirangam's lotus-like feet
which even today have a red colour
acquired from their unceasing immersion in
the sentiment of passionate love arising out of their stay in the mind of

the most excellent of sages
the illustrious Parankusa!

We take refuge in the feet of the One Who delights in Śrī
Whose shining crown freely spreads [its rays] clear down to His lotus-like feet
the soles of which are pervaded by
the decorative marks

pitcher of nectar, parasol and lotus.
5
We celebrate the King at Srirangam's two feet one of which in the act of taking three strides
[to measure] the entire earth, traversed it [in a single step].
Although mountainous,
the earth [seemed to His foot] like land where high and low had disappeared with the mountains sticking to it like grains of sand strewn about!
6
You took the six [qualities] in their fullness knowledge, abundant untiring strength, lordliness, immutability,
power, and splendour
which come [to be divided] into three pairs, and becoming four-fold
have graced Your devotees
--
because of Your passionate love [for them].

O God!
7
Because Your eternal nature is the ground
of absolutely auspicious qualities
untouched by the despicable
it is said to possess
an infinite variety of forms.
For this reason alone
[the Vedas] have described You as
nameless and formless.
8
You transcend the senses --
You Whose omnipresence is wholly different from [the presence of] objects here [in this world]
which fall within the range of the senses beginning with sound.
Alas!
Because of this
You are completely invisible,
and are, therefore,
beyond the range of speech and mind!
9
Under circumstances such as these, had You not descended into the wombs of divine beings, humans, and others
because of Your own desire
to play [in this world]
then we would have had no way of knowing the valid means of resorting to You.

O Sole Ocean of compassion! Ah! How [are we to comprehend] this accessibility of Yours?!
Having incarnated here
in the middle of the Cosmic Egg
the lowly dwelling place of ordinary people You, the Wholly Contented One,

11
You bow down and seek a boon
from the very one You saved from an enormous sin
whose head was purified
by the water [flowing] from Your foot.
Oh! Your act of sport is strange indeed!

[When You assumed] the body of a Man-Lion, Śiva -- as Sarabha --

[Such] unrestrained conduct is appropriate only toward those who are at Your command!
14
Sleeping on a banyan leaf as an innocent baby You held the worlds in Your very subtle body without contracting them.
Incarnated here [on earth],
why do you guilelessly reveal
Your unfathomable lordly power?
15
You are placed in between Brahmā and Śiva and have a similar position
in the line of solar divinities
where on account of being Aditi's son You became Indra's younger brother.
You also took birth in the Ikṣvāku family and in the lineage of Yadu.
What a wonder and how praiseworthy for the incomparable Supreme Splendour!
16
Was it impossible for You to obtain
the three worlds
which You Yourself created
and which remain in Your stomach
[during the time of the cosmic dissolution] without begging?

[But then] if You had not traversed the world
and measured it with Your strides,
how would Śruti
[have come to] be revered?
17
I [want to] ask You about
that indescribable [event]
when as [Rāma] the Raghava
You were enticed by the deceptive deer because of Your simplicity in being human.
How did You
Who were powerless
during Your separation from Sītā --
not [even] knowing where she had gone grant the Highest Goal [of liberation] to a bird?
18
Oh! When You are powerful enough to put onto the path of liberation
[even] the lower being Jatayu
who was killed by a Brahmin
and had not traversed the path of yoga
then why were You unable
to rescue Your Queen [Sitā]
and why did You grieve while searching [for her]?
19
You rendered leafless seven sala trees
along with the mountains and the nether worlds by the slow momentum of a single arrow.

Poem in Praise of the Superhuman [Activities of God] 65
Why then did You seek as a helpmate
the monkey [Sugrīva]
who was put to rout by the monkey [Vāli] and was confused and distressed
at destroying even one of them?
20
Quickly consoling the best of monkeys [Sugriva]
Your servant and friend
whose mind was bewildered by his love for You and who, because of his anger,
wanted to kill his enemy, the monkey Vāli, You pierced the sala trees and the mountains.
Or again!
21
When You killed [Vāli]
not face to face like an enemy
but hiding like a hunter in chase of a wild beast, [how can You say] that [doing so]
was right for You
a descendant of the Raghu family
when even considering an animal as an enemy is wholly unacceptable!
22
When You first began to behave like a human You then undertook an exploit
surpassing [even those of] the gods, in that...!
What in the world have we here, O Lord? You built a bridge across the ocean with rocks brought and thrown by monkeys!

Conqueror of the great god King Varuṇa
with a valour in which
humanness itself was an ornament, and praised by the gods

24
When You had not yet crossed the ocean or conquered the demon chief [Rāvaṇa]
and did not even know
his strengths and weaknesses,
how is it that You quickly and unhesitatingly anointed his younger brother Vibhīṣaṇa to his position (as King of Lanka]?
25
Making the demons on the great island
in the far-off northern ocean
a feast for Your single arrow,
why did you not reduce Lanka to ashes
standing [right there]
on the shore of the southern ocean?
Tell [me] this!
26
How is it that the ocean churned by You -- [an act] well-known in the three worlds - gave up its true nature
and became transformed into
a horse, celestial nymphs, poison, nectar, the moon, the tree of paradise, and Lakṣmi?

O Hero of the Raghus!
You saw the sinful enemy [Rāvaṇa]

Bravo! [Tell me]...
which of Your qualities [was revealed] then? To which group [of qualities] does it belong? How great is it?
The object of whose praise
and to be understood by whom?
28
Your younger brother Lakṣmaṇa
who fainted because of the enemy's missile and became too heavy for the enemy [to lift] became light for Hanuman!
Because of this [episode]
Your swoon
caused by Your being tied down
by the enemy Indra's magical weapon has become well-understood!
29
Woe is me! Alas! Alas!
Since I was not present during the time
[of Your Rāma incarnation]
when [liberation] was easily obtained
with the causes of darkness uprooted completely
even for grass and trees,
when oh when will I look upon
Your pair of lotus-like feet?

68
Atimanuṣa Stava
30
Desirous of favouring the Raghu family,
You incarnated here [on earth]
and showered down streams of divine qualities.
Trees enjoying the coolness
arising from Your proximity
became faded in separation from You.
31
Passing beyond bondage,
grass and other such things --
not at all qualified to practice dharma, to repeat [the names of God],
or [to practice] the yoga of knowledge -- were made to attain the Highest Place because of the fragrance of their connection with the surface of that earth
traversed by You!
32
Truly You are possessed of
such auspicious qualities that Hanuman
who experienced them
in the day-to-day behaviour
of Your Rama incarnation
knowingly renounced the highest liberation and even today enjoys Your activities right here [in Srirangam].
33
With supreme compassion
You pardoned the crow [Jatayu]

For that reason alone
I consider it appropriate
[for You] to comfort a person like me
even though I am a great sinner.
34
Pūtanā, Śakata and the pair of arjuna trees became moths in the flame
of Your appropriately childish pranks
with [their childlike] intention.
Oh! Then how come such a [powerful] one as You feared Kamsa
and grew up hidden in Vraja?
35
Oh! Eternally dwelling
with Your greatest wealth, the divine Śrī,
while the immortals forever
look upon Paramapada,
and sought after
by the practitioners of yoga
through their yogic meditations,
why did [one such as] You
steal fresh butter in Vraja?

Who cannot be apprehended by the minds
of even good-hearted people
"Eternal One", "Remover of Bondage" and "Highest Lord".

What a wonder it is that
we have heard of You also as
"He Who was bound with a rope"

In the boundless play of the Lord's childhood, Pūtana, Sakata, and the pair of arjuna trees became moths [burnt] in the flame
of Your splendour
by means of Your accidental childhood pranks with their [childlike] intention!
38
When there was in Your own home
an abundance of milk products
why then did You steal from the neighboring houses?
While carrying off [the pots] why did You spill
what remained in the jars?
And why did You [allow Yourself to] become
a laughingstock
for the cowherdesses?
39
O Lord!
If You had a mind to hide
the fresh butter that You had stolen
then, O Innocent One,
why did you go out fearlessly
after having wiped Your tender
butter-smeared finger
on Your body?

Such an adventure of Yours

[Tell me], O Highest One!
Bearing a face beaming
with eyes wide as lotus petals
reaching to the edge
of your beautiful curls
with gracefully raised eyebrows
a smile flashing forth

from the cowherders' homes
or [did you steal]
the hearts of the cowherdesses [as well] ?

None indeed is more blessed

Alas! Woe is me that I was not born in those sands

separated from You

in the rāsa dance
resorting to the rows of Your footprints,

NOTES
"Occasional incarnation" (vibhavāvatāra) is the Śrīvaiṣṇava technical term for Vişņu's incarnations restricted to particu- lar times and places, such as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa.
"gods" (amara), lit., "immortals".
The phrase "fountain of honey" (madhunaḥ utsaḥ) is based on VSū: vişnoḥ pade parame madhva-uthsaḥ.
Although the central objects of Kūresa's praise-poem are the occasional incarnations of Visņu, even so he begins the work with four verses (vs. 2-5) extolling the Lord's iconic incarnation in the Srirangam Temple.
In this stanza Kūresa plays on the word rāga, which means both "redness" and "passionate love" (anurāga).
The very close relationship between Nammālvār and the Lord depicted in the verse is based on a relationship that is described in Nammāļvār's own poems. See, for example, TVM 7.9.1, 7.9.7-8, and 10.7.1-4.
Poetic references to the shining rays of the Lord's crown are common in the DP. See, for example, PĀTM 4.1.1. This stanza praises the Lord's four-fold creative cosmic emanation (vyūhāvatāra).
This verse is a very succinct summary of Rāmānuja, ŚrīBh
III. 2.5.11-25.
Compare with Rāmānuja, ŚrīBh I.2.1.33.
Kūresa makes the point in this stanza that Śruti alone cannot lead one to God; rather, He must reveal Himself in His in- carnations. A similar view is expressed in VRS, vs. 6-10. This verse, and the verses referred to above, imply that God Himself is not only the goal (upeya) but the means or way (upaya) to reach the goal of Himself.
Vişņu sought the boon of a child from lord Siva. See Hari Vamsa, Vişņu Parva.
See also SBS, vs. 95-97 and VRS, v. 68.
Kūresa engages in word-play in this stanza. Sarabha is the name of a particular form of Siva and salabha means "moth". According to the rules of Sanskrit grammar, the sounds "r" and "1" are interchangeable (ralaiyoḥ abhedaḥ).

The concept of māyā found in this verse as the wonderful and baffling creative power of the Lord is similar to Rāmānuja's. See, for example, ŚrīBh I.1.1.1 where Rām- ānuja refutes the idea that māyā is synonymous with the in- describable or the unreal: "and hence the word māyā de- notes the creation of wonderful things.... The Highest Person is called the Mayin, simply because He is the owner of that [māyā], but not because He is characterised by ignorance...." For the Alvar influence on Ramanuja's understanding of māyā, see Poykai Alvar, MTA, v. 7 and Nammālvār, TVM, 1.3.10.
"Whose identity You assumed" (yasyātmatām..adhāḥ tvam) appears to refer to God as the Inner Controller (antaryamin) or "Soul of the soul" of all beings.
"Placed in between Brahma and Śiva" refers to the usual or- dering of the three gods when they are presented as creator, preserver, and destroyer: Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva.
The elaborate geneologies of VP contain numerous refer- ences to Visņu's births in the line of solar deities (I.15.130- 131), in the Ikṣvāku family as Rāma (IV.4.41), and in the Yadu family as Kṛṣṇa (IV.11).
"To a bird", that is, to Jaṭāyu.
In this verse, Kūresa employs virodha-alarikāra. This poetic device has as its purpose the pointing out of contradictory acts, followed by a questioning as to how things could have happened thus. Kūresa uses it effectively to express his en- joyment of divine paradox.
The answer to Kūresa's question as to why Rama killed Vali in the way He did, "not face to face like an enemy...but hiding like a hunter in chase of a wild beast" is given in the Rāmāyaṇa itself: (1) The general rule against killing cannot be applied here because monkeys are mere animals, and Rāma was a king, for whom hunting is an appropriate activ- ity; (2) Rama killed the enemy of a good friend; and (3) Rāma had given his word to Sugrīva that he would kill his enemy and thus allow him to gain complete control of the kingdom. If if he had gone to the battlefield, Vāli would certainly have surrendered to him, and he therefore would not have been able to kill him. Had he permitted this to

happen, his words would have been rendered untruthful. (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, Bombay 1987). The fact that these answers are given in the text itself points to the fact that in this verse Kūresa is merely "teasing" the Lord, and enjoying an intimate rela- tionship with Him, rather than expecting an answer to a se- rious question.
"Unborn One/Birthless One" (aja). The epithet appears three times in the VSN. For a variety of Śrīvaiṣṇava ety- mologies, see Bhaṭṭar, BhGD Nos. 96, 206 and 524. Note that all three etymologies emphasize the transcendence and supremacy of the Lord, and hence the epithet adds appropri- ate irony to Kūresa's paradoxical verse.
Kūresa teases the Lord here with the well-known fact that only things which are already contained in a substance can come out from it at its churning; for example, butter comes from milk. It is not the nature of the ocean to produce a horse, celestial nymphs, poison, etc.
There is a dispute over the position of this verse in the stotra. In some editions, this verse appears as v. 17, and some editors believe that it is more appropriate to that con-
text.
Two basic groups of the Lord's qualities are referred to in this stanza: (1) qualities which are necessary for the Lord to be reached by His devotees, and (2) qualities necessary for
the Lord to fulfill the desires of the devotees.
The idea expressed by Kūresa in this stanza is that both Lakṣmaṇa's fainting in battle and Rama's being tied down were permitted in order that their humanity might be re- vealed.
According to the Rāmāyaṇa story, even the grass and trees existing at the time and place of the Lord's incarnations are said to attain enlightenment through their association with Him. When Rāma left Ayodhya, the entire place was liber- ated. The same idea is expressed in Kulacekara Āļvār, Pmā!TM 10.10, in which it is mentioned that "on that day" (anru), that is, when Rāma left for Vaikuntha, both moving and non-moving things (caracarankalar) went to Vaikuntha along with Him.

Hanuman is regarded as a ciranjivi or one of seven persons blessed with immortality. The others are: Asuddhāma, Bali, Vyāsa, Vibhīṣaṇa, Kṛpācārya, and Parasurāma (MTL, III, 1426).
Even today this verse is recited at the beginning of every Śrīvaiṣṇava reading of the Rāmāyaṇa. The members of the community believe that Hanuman attends every recitation of the Epic, where he listens devoutly, keeping his hand over his head and with tears in his eyes. For this reason, a front- row seat is always reserved for him.
Kūresa follows PATM 1.8.7 here by mentioning in a single verse three unconnected VP episodes -- Kṛṣṇa's drinking poison milk from the breast of Pūtanā, His killing of the demon in the form of a wagon (śakaṭāsura), and His uprooting of the arjuna tree when tied to a mortar by his mother Yasoda. See also v. 37.
"While the immortals forever look upon Paramapada" (pasyatsu sūrīşu sadā...paramapadam). Note how in this verse Kūresa combines Ālvār themes with phraseology of Upanisadic and Puranic verses important to Rāmānuja. Rāmānuja quotes SuUp 6 in VS, para. 122: "The immortals forever look upon that Supreme Abode of Viṣṇu" (tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paṣyanti sūrayāḥ). And he cites VP in para. 133: "The Yogis, who in perfect concentra- tion constantly meditate upon Brahman, possess that Supreme Place which the immortals regard". Kṛṣṇa's being bound with a rope is one of Kūresa's (and Nammālvār's and Maturakavi's) favorite stories. (See, for example, KNCT). The significance of the Damodara episode for Śrivaiṣṇavas is the accessibility and vulnerabil- ity of God that it reveals. The marks left by the rope tied by Yasoda indicate that God becomes the slave of His devo-
tees.
Note how Kūresa combines this Puranic story with epi- thets from the Upanisads.
The idea of Kṛṣṇa becoming a "laughingstock" is found also in PĀTM 2.7.1: "You are drinking milk (palai) from the pot and those around you are laughing". See also Tirumankai Alvār, PTM 2.2.1.

Atimănușa Stava
The later Śrīvaiṣṇava commentators regard the "noble peo- ple" (arya-janaḥ) referred to in this verse as the Alvārs, es- pecially Nammālvār. PSV reflects this tradition in its gloss of the word arya-janaḥ with "Śuka, Parāśara, and so forth, and Lord of the Bhaṭṭas (Periyālvār), Parānkusa (Namm- āļvār), Parakāla (Tirumankai Alvar), and others". Accord- ing to an ancient tradition, Śrīvaiṣṇavas believe that Namm- ālvār lost consciousness at the thought of the Supreme Lord being tied with a rope, as expressed in TVM 5.10.1. See also 1.3.1: "When he stole the butter that was left on the churning stick, he was tied by a rope. 'How can that be, how can that be?"" Śrīvaiṣṇava legend holds that Namm- āļvār kept repeating the last line, "How can that be?", be- cause he was in a religious ecstacy.

This verse includes several "signs of a great man” (mahā- puruṣa-lakṣaṇa ).
"Pollution" (malinatva) may also be translated "wickedness,
blackness, impurity".
In Sanskrit literature, wild animals becoming calm in the presence of a divine figure is a common motif. Here the transformation takes place not just because of the presence of Kṛṣṇa, but because of the beautiful sound of His flute. A similar imagery is found in PATM 3.6.8-10.
The Lord's body is ENHANCED by the cowherder's attire, because it accentuates His total accessibility. The longing for the Yamuna River, Mathura, Bṛndāvana and the places associated with Kṛṣṇa is often expressed by Antal. See, for example, NT 12.1-10 and 14.1-10. For the footprints of Kṛṣṇa as a symbol of His absence, see
52
VP 5.13.29-40.
"The god of love" (ananga, lit., "bodiless") is "the name of Kama, the god of love, so-called because he was made bodiless by a flash from the eye of Siva for having at- tempted to disturb his life of austerity by filling him with
love for Parvati" (M-W, 24).
"my family deity Bṛndavana" (kula-daivatam me
bṛndavanam). Ramanuja refers to Lord Narayana as his
"family deity" (kula-daivatam) in VaiGad, para. 3.

Kṛṣṇa Himself is said to prefer tending cows to the glories of Vaikuntha in Nammālvār, TVM 10.3.10.
See PATM 4.8.1-3 which contains three consecutive stanzas on these three unrelated incidents.
"the three-fold fault" (tri-vidhāpacara). The three categories of offences or sins (apacāra) are delineated by Rāmānuja in his ŚGad, para. 16. They are: (1) serious offences or sins committed against Me, that is against the Lord (ananta-mad- apacāra); (2) serious offences or sins committed toward My (i.e., the Lord's) [devotees] (ananta-madiyāpacara ); and (3) serious, unbearable or unforgiveable sins or offences (ananta-sahyapacāra).
The "words spoken [in the previous verse]" to which Kūresa refers are the famous formula of ritual surrender "I take refuge with/ in /at Your feet" (tvadiya caranau śaraṇaṁ prapadye).

Sundarabahu Stava
1
I have obtained wisdom from the chief of ascetics Rāmānuja and have taken refuge with the auspicious feet of Hari.
With a desire to contemplate those feet, I now fearlessly set out to praise the beautiful broad-armed Lord.
2
We worship the beautiful long-armed [Lord]
Who dwells on a mountain
covered with a thicket of trees
that celebrated pilgrimage place on the Nupura River
which [wise ones] know [to be] the bestower of desired boons.
3
The River called Nūpura
flows swiftly in one place
slow and languid in another, staggers unsteadily in one spot
and is foamy with a crashing sound at another.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
She meanders here and there
85
and in places even plummets [down the mountain] as if intoxicated at having drunk
the honey-wine named Susundarabhuja.
4
May we worship the Lord [Who dwells]
on a mountain surrounded by a thicket of trees
Who has beautiful iron-bar-like arms
that obtained ambrosia
and the nectar named Indirā
from churning the ocean
with Mount Mandara as a churning stick
Whose mind is prone
toward people seeking shelter
and Who is a refuge for the souls
of shelterless ones like me.
5
I worship Hari my refuge
the sound of Whose unfettered conch
shatters the seven worlds
Who has made His abode on a forest mountain
covered with dense lush thickets
of abundant trees
resembling delusion-causing darkness the cluster of whose lofty peaks is enriched
by the moon's crawling round it like a child.
6
[The peak of] the great forest mountain holds the surface of the spotless moon
which has become a mirror

Sundarabahu Stava
86
[clasped] by the celestial damsels seated on its lofty summit
whose faces are adorned
with the udhvrapuṇḍra mark.
[That same mountain] is
the abode of the beautiful-armed [Lord]!
7
That great mountain
full of forest groves
is the home of
Sri's Lord.
The monkeys saw the crescent moon which has come to its peaks
and thinking then
of its role as the crest jewel of Śiva
clearly touch it not
because it has taken refuge
with a god other [than Vişnu]!
8
What a place is Sundarabahu's Vanādri! where the resolution of a love quarrel occurred when an elephant was following a she-elephant
who became frightened
at getting a divine command [to stop].
9
This is the auspicious abode called Forest Mountain
belonging to the One
Who is a treasure-house of beauty
and the bearer of Sri
[a place] where snakes
are not cut to pieces by peacocks because of [respect

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
for] the greatness of the family
of the lord of serpents.
10 & 11
This is the most excellent Forest Mountain
of Acyuta, on which
in order to be faithful to each other
in word [and deed]
birds swear an oath
at the feet of the lord of birds [Garuḍa]
and all serpents
[swear] on the lord of serpents [Adiseṣa].
The entire family of monkeys [swears] at the foot of Hanuman
so also bears [swear] on Jambavān
the chief of their own family.
Vultures [swear] on Jaṭāyu,
the master of their lineage
and elephants swear on the one named Gajendra,
the chief of their own lineage.
87
12
When the enamoured celestial choristers
endowed with melody, sentiment and basic emotion
are engrossed [in singing]
the words of Vakuladhara
here on the slopes of Sundara's Forest Mountain even the mill-stone melts!

88
Sundarabahu Stava
27
13
At eventide in Sundarabhuja's mountainous woods a female bee buzzes
to the rhythm of [swaying] swans;
and enriching that
female cuckoos celebrate [the holy spot]
in song;
as a result of [the beauty of] all this,
a nectar-tear oozes out
from the face of an excellent creeper, the rows of deer
have become motionless and tranquil, and the rocks and sand banks have become cool!
14
May that Indescribable Entity clad in a golden garment reveal Himself to me!
[He] Whose cooling glance grants [many] a boon
Who has arms reaching down to His knees
and long-stretching, beautiful ears,
the bearer of Laksmi
Who has vowed to remain [forever]
on the glorious, great Forest Mountain.
15
I adore that Splendour
celebrated in song in the Upanisads thus:
"From Whom [proceeds] birth, the life [cycle], the dissolution, and liberation of the worlds..."
That One
Who is the sole remedy for all evils is manifest in Vanasaila.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
16
I resort to the lotus-eyed Sundara
the Lord upon Whom Śri has climbed
Who is described in the acme of the Three Vedas with the words "Sat", "Brahman", "Ātman", and so also by the utterance "Nārāyaṇa" -- [words] which are brilliant because they produce
knowledge of the uniqueness
of the [sole] Object [of affection] obtained through their conformity with the drift [of other Upanisadic statements] Who has no peer, no superior, no second
the Immortal One
visible [here] in the bower of Vanagiri.
17
The One Whom Śruti praises as
Lord of the universe from Whom [gods] such as Brahma and Śiva issue forth the Lord of souls
Supreme Brahman [Primal] Man Highest Light Highest Truth
and
Nārāyaṇa is also called
the One upon Whom Śri has climbed.
That One
Who has His abode in Vanagiri
is victorious!
18
May Sundarabhuja enter our hearts
[He] Who controls the cluster of entities
beginning with the soul and ending with the earth,

8990
Sundarabahu Stava
and as their Inner Controller
has them for His body
[although] He cannot be perceived by them, the Lord Who inhabits Vanagiri
without at all abandoning
His own sovereignty [in Vaikuntha]!
19
We worship the beautiful broad-armed Susundara Whose dwelling place is on Forest Mountain Whom Śruti describes
as the birthplace of the "Great One"
Who really has no birth
even in the inner soul!
20
May I praise Sundarabhuja Who
reclining on the coils of the Serpent King
is an adept in love
for the great Forest Mountain
Whom [wise ones] know
from the Upanisadic statements as
"subtle ether within the cavity of the heart" and "the possessor of eight qualities".
21
I praise the One named Sundara
the long-lotus-eyed [Lord] and the Resident of Vanagiri dependent upon Whom are
the entire phenomenal existence
and the limitless dependent universe
controlled by His own will
in its essential nature, sustenance and creation,

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
Who is therefore describable by all words
expressive of the non-sentient (acit) body as if it were sentient (cit)
and hence Who is ever irreproachable
91
on account of His having annihilated imperfection.
22
The Lord is [popularly] regarded as auspicious because He is the possessor of auspicious qualities [whereas in truth]
the contrary is a well-established [fact].
[The Lord's qualities get their auspiciousness] from having resorted to His essential nature!
We take refuge with that Sundarabāhu
taintless and in the form of knowledge and boundless bliss!
23
Here on the slope of Forest Mountain
I surrender to the One named
Sundara
the incomparable Hari
ever the opposite
of all that is tainted
Whose eternal state resembles a rippleless ocean
brought about by bliss born from the experience of His own boundless glory!
24
I take refuge with Sundarabhuja
the One upon Whom Śri has climbed Who delights in the great royal garden

92
Sundarabahu Stava
surrounding the mountain
possessed of multitudes of trees
Whose state is eternally enriched by
expansive strength, knowledge, creative power,
splendour, immutability, and lordliness which are limitless and are called
the group of six qualities.
25
Endowed with the principal qualities of tenderness,
impartiality toward all, charm and beauty with gracious condescension, motherly affection toward those who come to Him for refuge, softness, good-heartedness,
impartiality, and straightforwardness
with firmness, steadfastness, immutability, valour,
fulfillment, profundity, and skillfulness,
God Sundara remains forever making His abode on the auspicious mountain of forest woods.
26
I have fled for refuge to Sundarabāhu
Vanadri's Lord
ever irreproachable
on account of His having annihilated sin,
Who is enkindled by
eternal and divine auspicious qualities
possessed of such limitless greatness and countless richness
that even a single drop
of one quality from among them
would make extraordinary its own substratum;

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
[yet those very qualities] are dependent upon [the Supreme] Soul
as their substratum of auspiciousness!
93
27
Our treasure Sundara,
a storehouse of knowledge
because He sees all the worlds
simultaneously and eternally by direct perception, shines brightly in the bowers of Lion Mountain!
28
Lordliness, splendour, untiring strength, immutability and creative power -- what kinds [of qualities are these] as they abide in Sundarabahu, the Birthless One Who
out of even a very slight will [to create] brings about the generation, maintenance,
and dissolution of all the worlds?
29
As a result of [a single act of] prostration, Sundara, lover of the slopes of Forest Mountain,
instantly forgives people
who are weighted down and covered by such limitless, constantly committed sins accumulated here in this beginningless samsara the fruit of a single one of which
would not be lessened
even by an experience [of suffering] lasting tens of thousands of eons!

94
Sundarabahu Stava
30
Out of His motherly affection,
Sundara embraces anyone who seeks shelter in the shade of His feet
whatever the status of his birth
whatever his nature, whoever he be [and accepts that person] just as he is!
31
My refuge is Sundarabhuja
Who abides on Forest Mountain
Who would look upon any one worshipping Him as equal to the lord of serpents
[even if that person be]
exceedingly low by caste or inauspicious actions or as insignificant as a blade of grass
due to the absence of good qualities.
32
In [the matter of] Sundarabahu Kṛṣṇa, Śruti
[desirous of] settling the kind and amount of bliss
in the experience of each and every one of His auspicious qualities
[started to describe] them as:
"Those which are one hundred fold..."
[but ultimately] proclaimed:
"This One is not within
the range of speech and mind".
33
May I celebrate Indira's Lord
the beautiful broad-armed bestower of boons the Resident of Vanagiri
Who has lotus-feet, lotus-eyes, lotus-hands and [a body black] with the sheen of collyrium!

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
34
Resembling the lustre that arises from
the mixture of essences derived from
95
the churning of liquid gold, emeralds and collyrium, the indescribable complexion
of the beautiful broad-armed Lord
Who delights in Vanagiri
conquers [all who see it]!
35
Why do people call Him Alankara (“Ornament") ?
Is it because He is His own adornment? or because He decorates Forest Mountain
embellished everywhere by
groves of growing young trees?
36
May Vanagiri's Lord be my refuge!
He Who is named Alankara
because of all [His decorations and garlands]
extremely fragrant, ever pleasing to the touch and delightful to His delicate-as-a-flower limbs along with the group of divine ornaments and the collection of divine weapons
which should themselves adorn
but are instead decorated [by Him].
37 & 38
May I praise the lotus-naveled Sundara
the possessor of multitudes of innumerable auspicious qualities Who blissfully sports
in the groves of Forest Mountain with a band tied around His crown

96
Sundarabahu Stava
a tiara, crest ornament, beautiful curls
a garland of forest flowers, earrings and an urdhvapuṇḍra mark
with the most excellent of jewels
a garland of forest flowers
necklaces, bracelets, and a neck ornament with decorations such as a bracelet of basil leaves
a waistband, and anklets
with sword, lotus, discus
bow, mace, and other weapons --
His splendour ever spreading [all] around.
39
Ah! Sundara's beautiful head
which has hair similar to swarms of big black bees
hovering about [the lotus of His face]
like libertines bewildered by
the beautiful heavenly fragrance residing there [wears] the King of crowns
the royal insignia of
His overlordship of the universe.
40
The mat of hair curls belonging to Kesava Hari
the Lord on Lion Mountain
which has great forests
abounding in big black bees
from a family resembling that [mat]
surpasses the description
of beautiful threads fashioned from the essence of pitch-black blinding darkness.
41
Similiar to the radiant flame of the half-moon
and bearing a glittering urdhvapundra mark, the untainted forehead of the Lord at Vanadri

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
upon Whom Śrī has climbed brilliantly beams forth.
42
What shines forth [before me]? Sundarabahu's pair of eyebrows
as graceful as a pair of beautiful bows or two rows of bees
approaching the thousand-petaled lotuses called His lovely eyes?
97
43
How can a lotus be [regarded as] a standard of comparison
for the Lord of Vanadri's long eyes
[when unlike those eyes, the lotus]
is not long,
does not exude love,
flashes forth [only] momentarily,
is insincere,
and is not a thief of the hearts of those who see it?
44
May the Lord named Alarkāra
Who has His abode on Vanagiri
look upon us with His eyes
which are solely and unswervingly engaged in
the activity of the creation, maintenance,
and dissolution of the universe.
His own beloved consorts were ravished by
the billows of His sidelong glances
seen diffusing [from eyes] engaged in sending forth
handfuls of the essence of
the ambrosia of overflowing love!

98
45
Sundarabahu Stava
The Lord at Vanasaila Susundarabhuja's straight, attractive nose shines forth
like a sprout on the boon-bestowing tree and resembles a bridge set in the midst of a sea
in the form of His enormous eyes overflowing with a flood of love's ambrosia!
46
With coral-like lips enriched by familiarity
with the nectar-stream of His soft smile and replete with extraordinary, delightful,
welcoming speech,
the Lord at Vanadri Sundarabhuja's mouth
shines forth!
47
The cheeks of Sundara Hari of Vanagiri
which has trees abounding
in big black bumble bees intoxicated from [sipping]
the mango-blossom nectar spread on all sides were ravished at being smelt by Yasoda
when she lifted His chin
with her fingertips!
[Those cheeks]
which even today clearly reveal
His unceasing joy
arising from that [experience]
illumine [Vanagiri]!
48
With beautiful long ears that seem to be imitating
two boon-bestowing creepers
[decorated with] the tall golden flowers

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
of His dangling earrings,
Susundarabhuja, the Ornament of Vanasaila, is a fetter for our minds!
99
49
The beautiful-armed young Susundára
Whose neck is enriched by earrings
which reach down to the ends of His curly hair and touch His well-formed shoulders
so pleasing [to the eye] where they meet His neck blossoms forth [in Vanagiri]!
50
On a mountain slope surrounded by groves of trees we worship the beautiful broad-armed Lord
Bearer of Mount [Govardhana]
Whose broad collar-bone
is hidden by His well-developed chest, and Whose neck resembles a glistening conch.
Sundara's arms
51
energized with rapture
during the churning [of the ocean]
with [Mount] Mandara
gladdened [in giving delight]
to Indira
and adorned by an anointing
with sandal and aloes
shine forth [here in Vanagiri]!
100
Sundarabahu Stava
52
Distinguished by a decoration that is
a scar [made] by His bow-string
and ever ready to bestow [upon His devotees]
ardently desired boons,
Susundarabhuja's arms
imitate with their bounty
the branches of the boon-bestowing tree.
53
The Ruler [of the Universe] at Vanagiri's arms
which have all the dark-hued richness
of an ocean, the sky, and a grove of tamāla trees are partakers of the enjoyment
of [the serpent] Sesa's coils
and like them are generous, strong, and round.
54
The arms of Sundarabahu Hari
the Lord at Vanagiri
which vied with one another in the sport
of uplifting Govardhana [Mountain],
worked together in the churning of the ocean,
and desired multiplicity
in the exhilaration [experienced
during] the embrace of His consorts,
[now] decorate [Vanagiri]!
Of the two-
55
the untainted conch and the discus
that have climbed onto
the auspicious Lord at Vanadri's lotus palms - the first rests on His lotus-[palm]
like an excellent royal swan,
[while] the second has approached

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
[the Lord's other lotus-palm]
like the sun that loves lotuses.
101
56
Enriched by a garland of forest flowers, the Lord at Vanādri Susundara's
broad, flawless chest --
the abode of Laksmi
adorned by the kaustubha gem
which is [itself] the abode of the śrivatsa mark -- shines forth!
The navel of Hari,
57
upon Whom Lakṣmi has climbed Who dwells on the mountain [covered] with a thicket of trees
delighted in by divine damsels with resplendent breasts resembling elephant heads decorates [Vanagiri]!
Moreover, [that navel] --
the birthplace of the lotus from which Brahma is born resembles a deep pit
[created by} a whirlpool stream overflowing with the essence of the ambrosia of loveliness.
-0
58
[All] the worlds reside within the stomach
of the beautiful Sundarabahu
the Lord of the forested mountain
which has trees abounding in auspiciousness!

102
[But] come see! Ah!
[His waist] has remained thin!
Sundarabahu Stava
59
The Lord of Forest Mountain
Sundara's good thighs
which pulverized the worms
in the form of wicked Madhu and Kaiṭabha, and are beautifully-rounded
like a pair of tapering elephant trunks illumine [Vanagiri]!
60
With an auspicious form resembling
the raised humps of two young bulls the knees of the All-pervasive One
named Sundarabhuja
Who churned the ocean with Mount Mandara and is Lord [of the Universe] at Vanagiri
with its valleys glittering
.with groves of sandal trees
shine brightly!
61
Where are my two eyes wandering,
having ignored the two legs
of Susundara the Lord on Forest Mountain similar to the well-rounded, lovely, good stems
of two lotuses placed face downwards
in the form of His feet?
62
Sundara's lotus-feet surpass the lotus-footrest
in tenderness.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
Otherwise, how indeed, could [that footrest] called "the thousand petaled [lotus]" bear them?
103
63
Sundarabhuja's lotus-feet
with their continuous flow of the essence
of beauty, tenderness, and sweet perfume defeated the lotus-[seat's] desire to emulate [them].
Indeed the vanquished [lotus-seat]
carries them on its head!
64
These are indeed the auspicious lotus-like feet of the One Who bears the name Sundara from the washing of which arises a tiny portion
of the streams of the Ganga.
Dhruva carries one stream on his head and Śiva bears another
appropriately named "Alakanandika"
about which [the Puranic composers] have sung.
65
May I salute Sundarabhuja's lotus-foot
a fragrant flower blossomed from
the boon-bestowing creeper that is the Veda
a royal swan [residing]
in the lotus-hearts of the yogi-kings
and the best of fruits,
the ripe mango that is the dharma.

104
Sundarabahu Stava
66
When the mind of Susundara
Who had taken the form of a dwarf [Vāmana]
wanted [to take] three strides,
His two [feet] were so impatient
that they crossed the three worlds
in two steps [only]!
67
Having surpassed in loveliness the splendour of the moon,
the line of Sundara's nails
a row of ripples from the nectar-ocean of beauty's essence called His toes now adorns [Vanagiri].
68
The moon that had become thin,
insignificant and soiled
at being "honoured" by [its place on] Śiva's head,
attained fullness, untaintedness,
brilliance and multiciplicity
[by] taking shelter at [Sundara's] feet
under the pretext of [assuming
the form of His] nails.
We honour that Sundara Whose resting-place is on the mountain [covered] with a thicket of trees.
69
It is accepted by all people that [the Lord's consort]
whose act of glancing
is the moment-by-moment cause
of the dominion of lords [such as Brahmā]
is [named] Śri because
she has resorted to Sundara.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
So people of noble speech declare You [to be]
the śri of Śri.
70
With divine, inscrutable, abundantly marvellous
excellent auspicious qualities
beginning with youthfulness and beauty and with amorous gestures that are dear
pregnant with wonderful emotion, graceful and ever incomparable, Vanadri's Lord delights Śrī
eternally inseparable [from Him] and suitable [for Him]
by virtue of her nature, form, and riches,
and [His other consorts] such as Nīlā and Bhūmi.
71
With sweet guidance in
the looks and expressions of love
and with heartfelt affection for
the intense observation of each other's gestures,
the Lord at Vanaśaila
Who experiences incessant and ever-fresh
divine sentiments
will delight His own beloved.
72
Respecting his own coil (bhogam)
[as meant] for the enjoyment (bhogam) of Sundara
the Resident of Vanagiri,
the lord of serpents
delights in his own names [Bhoga and] Śeşa
because his form is that of
subservience (seṣata) [to the Lord].

105
106
Sundarabahu Stava
73
The lord of the birds
who is composed of the Three Vedas [assumes] forms such as
vehicle, seat, canopy, and chowrie
[in order to serve Viṣṇu].
This same Sundarabhuja
Who delights in [Garuda's] eternal servitude has become the One Who goes to Vanadri!
74
The good commander of [Viṣṇu's] armies [becomes so] by eating the left-overs of Susundara
the Lord at Vanādri,
and as sole controller of all the worlds waits for [Visnu's] glance [of approval] before performing all his tasks.
75
Paraphernalia such as parasol and chowrie, the [eternal] sages and attendants,
and true and eternal qualities
beginning with knowledge and power
[have approached] the beautiful broad-armed [Lord] and blaze perpetually [in Vanādri].
76
Those who share the position of courtier, and also the best of door-keepers,
the leaders of the [Lord's] attendants,
and my earlier preceptors
have [all] resorted to Sundara
Who has gone to the mountain forest.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
77
Sundara Who abides eternally
in His own ever perfect region of enjoyment
[served by His] attendants and paraphernalia rejoices on the slopes of Vanagiri visible to the eyes of all.
107
78
The Bearer of Laksmi is just as devoted
to the slopes of Lion Mountain
as to the pleasure gardens of Vaikuntha
abounding in lush and fragrant flower-filled pools and bowers of beautiful vines!
79
Remaining eternally [in Vaikuntha] along with Lakṣmi, Bhū, and Nīlā
inside the great jewelled mandapa in the palace of bliss
[reclining] on the lord of serpents and fit to be served solely by
His own countless, eternal, and divine attendants, Sundarabahu
is devoted to Vanādri!
80
Remaining perpetually
in the eternal, limitless abode of Vaikuntha
which is called the Highest Sky,
is composed of the purest sattva,
and is the opposite of matter
made up of the three gunas,
that very Hari
Who transcends the best yogis' speech and mind is [simultaneously here] in Vanādri!

108
Sundarabahu Stava
81
This Primordial Egg
containing within itself the fourteen worlds
with their seven coverings multiplied by ten as well as hundreds of other such [eggs] have become [mere] playthings for Sundara in his action of sport here [in Vanagiri]!
82
This world differentiated variously
beginning with divine beings, humans, and animals
the Cosmic Egg with its seven coverings,
Prakṛti and Puruşa, and liberated souls
becomes a plaything for the action of the All-pervading Lord at Vanadri's sport!
83
Continually engaged in yoga
and blessed with the highest devotion
to Sundara's feet,
the possessors of knowledge
obtain Final Liberation in the Supreme Abode
and enjoy [there] the position of
eternal servitude [to the Lord].
84
So wonderful indeed is
God Sundarabhuja's character or motherly affection toward those who seek shelter [with Him],
that He, the Lord at Vanadri,
Who practices impartiality
toward those who take refuge with Him has adorned the world with His incarnations without giving up His inherent divine nature!

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
85
O Lord on Lion Mountain! The subtle [Upanisadic] statements described Your supra-sensual form as transcending speech and mind.
This being so,
had You not descended here
[making Yourself visible to all],
109
the injunctions regarding knowledge and devotion would have become meaningless by now!
86
You incarnated in the middle of the [Cosmic Egg]
assuming the divine forms of
gods, humans, and others
in order to embrace those devotees
whose minds have You as their sole enjoyment and for whom [You] are the only salvation, and in order to destroy their enemies.
O Lord at Vanagiri!
Because of this,
petitionary prayer for whatever one wants has become easy for gods and humans!
87
O Lord on the great, resplendent Forest Mountain! If people have been blinded to Your glory by Your primary appearance
as Vişņu in between Brahma and Śiva, then how [much more so] would they be after learning of Your becoming a fish!
110
Sundarabahu Stava
Hey God!
O Sundarabhuja!
88
Acting contrary to Your [true] greatness, if You so easily accept
[equality to Brahma and Śiva]
in the middle of the [Cosmic] Egg, then fostering inferiority to these gods would be even better than
[encouraging mere] equality to them!
89
O Lord at Vanādri!
After having descended here
concealing Your lordly glory, which pleased You more
Śiva's victory [over You]?
or being tied down by the weapon of Indrajit?
90
O Lord on Lion Mountain!
O Bearer of Lakṣmi!
O Ever Undiminished One!
Even though You want to conceal it,
the magnificence of the lotus-eyed One is easily perceived!
How can Your might not [be seen],
when You assumed the divine form of a fish flopping about in the flood of ocean water [at the time] of the deluge
in which a whirlpool was made to revolve shaken by the flipping of Your tail raised on high?

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
91
Long ago at the time of the deluge,
You took the wonderful form of a fish
and grew up in the water
of a pit in the ground
a pond
and the River Gangā
with Manu's boat tied to your crest,
O Sundara!
92
Becoming a shelter for the gods who were wandering about with despondent faces,
seeking asylum because their own abodes were filled with flood water
during the dissolution of the worlds, out of His own compassion this fish-bodied Sundarabhuja
Who dwells in Vanagiri
with a majestic gait
supported the mountain range on His own back
in His action of making turbid
the water impelled by the surging sea!
93
Long ago You, the Unborn One,
Who assumed the wonderful form of a tortoise
bothered neither by the rotation
of the best of mountains
[placed on] Your own back
nor by the movements of the Milk Ocean
severely shaken at being churned by the Serpent,
rejoiced [and hence] Your eyes [retained]
the lustre of a fully-bloomed lotus!
O Hari! O Beloved of Lion Mountain!

111

94
Sundarabāhu Stava
O Sundara!
O Resident of Lion Mountain!
Because of the desire of You Who are Varaha for the uplifting of the world
sunk [in the deluge of the cosmic dissolution], this earth long ago became visible
as a spot on the moon called "tusk".
O Sundarabhuja!
95
When the Man-Lion
with a resplendent wonderful form
was in the pillar,
the air throbbed not
the moon and the sun set not
the quarters became obscured
the entire earth with its mountain ranges shook
the sky melted
and the water of the ocean boiled!
96
When the Man-Lion tore open
the chest of the enemy of the gods
the nether world was scattered
and the abode of the gods was dissolved
the earth was thoroughly shaken
the quarters were obscured
and the ocean surged
swaying to and fro with a [swishing] sound, O Sundarabhuja!
97
That [very same] Man-Lion
Who saw His own form
reflected in the mass of blood

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
113
flowing from a region of the demon's chest tom with the tips of His sword-like claws and became enraged on account of His suspicion
[that the reflection was that] of a rival lion is visible here [in Vanagiri] as Sundara.
98
How can [the earth]
deserve being begged for by You
O Lord at Vanagiri, O Varada, O Vāmana when it belongs to You alone
because You create, sustain, and destroy it, and also because You swallow it,
eject it [from Your stomach], and raise it up?
99
O Lord at Vanagiri lovely with jasmines! Do You remember [how]
a long time ago, becoming Bhargava, You cut down the forest of arms
belonging to Arjuna
who was puffed up with pride at his power?
100
O Lord at Vanagiri!
You descended here
and became a Raghava, O Sundara, for the purpose of instructing believers in how to practice
completely and without any omissions
the dharma enjoined by the revered Three Vedas which are known as Your commandment.

114
Sundarabahu Stava
101
The Lord at Vanagiri is regarded by the gods
as the Supreme Ruler
because He broke the Destroyer of Tripura's
Tripura-destroying bow
and because of the sight of Him
stringing His own bow
as Paraśurāma.
102
Here [in this transitory world]
people want what they can't have
and what they can have they don't truly enjoy.
O Rāma, all things are already Yours, so You look upon the [whole] world as equal to a blade of grass, O Sundara!
103
A relisher [of the beauty of nature],
You experienced living in Dandaka Forest
on the mountains
in the wooded thickets
and near crystalline streams.
[Desirous] of enjoying [that loveliness] once again
O Rāma
You became Sundara
and now resort to the excellent Forest Mountain!
O Sundara!
104
On a rock at the site of Vanagiri's slopes decorated with groves of trees and gardens
[inhabited by] celestial musicians
and pure, semi-divine beings

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
clinging to the large rocks
and singing loudly of Your exploits, You enjoy respite from the fatigue caused by Your pursuit of the fleeing deer!
105
What a story we've heard!
Standing on the shore of the southern ocean
You tore apart with a single arrow
the demons who had gone far away
to the northern part of the ocean
and then conquered the lord of waters [Varuṇa].
Therefore, O Lord at Vanādri
O Resplendent One, O Sundara
Your amusements
beginning with the building of a bridge
are just a noisy spectacle!
106
O Ornament of the Raghu dynasty!
Long ago You were intent upon
hunting the deceptive deer,
namely the demon [Marica].
Do You today resort to Vanādri
full of thickets of trees
in which bees are buzzing in order to remove the exhaustion brought on by that [event]?
Hey Sundara!
107
In that one birth when You became Kṛṣṇa Rukmuni as well as Nīlā
suitable [for You] because of her lineage

115
116
Sundarabahu Stava
were boons for You
Who graciously favoured in a single instant
two mothers, two fathers
and also two families!
108
O Sundara, do tell [me]!
When You were still a nursing infant
and drank from the breast of Pūtanā, did you digest in Your stomach
the indigestible poison in the form of milk along with her life itself?
109
If You took on the condition of a human
becoming easily accessible
to those who seek refuge [with You] -- so be it, O Sundara!
[But] what made You [allow Youself] to be tied with a rope to a mortar,
and to what end did You then start crying?
110
O beautiful broad-armed [Lord]!
Becoming Nanda's delight,
with hair curls having the illusory appearance
of big black bees,
You stole [not only] the best fresh butter
from the houses [in Bṛndāvana]
[but] the hearts of the cowherdesses too!
111
O Sundara Who has resorted to Vanasaila! My head desires the state

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
of Kaliya's hood
or the top of the good kadamba [tree] because Your pair of lotus-feet
was placed upon them!
112
Even though, O Sundara,
You hid your glory in Vraja,
why did you overrun Indra?
Why did you hold aloft [Govardhana] Mountain
for seven nights?
And why did You
get angry
with inquisitive friends?
113
O Son of Nanda!
O Susundara!
O One named Sundara!
On hearing the sound of Your flute
as You frolicked with the cowherdesses
in Bṛdāvana,
the trees and rocks
melted just like wax!
O Sundara!
114
O Broad-armed One!
O Lord at Vanagiri!
When You sported in Bṛndāvana with multitudes of cowherdesses
singing and singing again

117
118
Sundarabahu Stava
in the festivity of the rāsa dance, the hearts of those women experienced varied shades of the moods of love.
What indescribable condition [of joy] did your own heart experience then?
115
Your amorous gestures
and the blinking of Your eyes
are delightful, wonderful, and agreeable.
Your chastisement of worms like Kamsa is extolled as [an equally] trifling [act], O Sundara.
O Sundarabhuja!
116
Your amusements such as the burning of Varanasi
the destruction of Pauṇḍraka and Bhauma
the snatching away of the parijata tree
the paralysing of Siva
and other [feats]
such as the slaughter of the armies
in the Bharata [War]
are nectar to the ears.
O Sundara!
117
O Lord at Vanādri!
With Your pair of lotus-feet served by the gods,
You perpetually stand on the peak
of the excellent Mountain called Venkata
for the sake of those who seek shelter [with You]!

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
118
Making Your home
on the Hill of the Elephant
You are appropriately named
the Boon-Bestower King.
You compassionately grant [Your devotees] whatever they desire,
and You take pity on
the entire universe,
O Sundara!
119
O Sundara! O Lord at Vanādri!
You eternally recline
on the Serpent Couch
in the middle of the Milk Ocean.
[Yet] out of motherly affection You have made Your glory present to Your devotees on earth, and here on the banks of the [river]
that arises from the Sahya Mountains, You recline on the Serpent Couch in Your own Abode of Srirangam becoming a feast for the eyes of all!
120
Becoming Kalki, O Lord,
You will kill all the wicked people polluted by Kali [Yuga's] impurity!
This is Your chance,
O Lakṣmi's Lord, O Susundara!
Punish [them now] right before our eyes!

121
Such are the best of Your incarnations that all of them have as their purpose
the protection of people
who have taken refuge with You.
Never is it otherwise!
So, O Sundara,
I take refuge with
You!
122
Poets celebrate You
as an ocean of the nectar of compassion, as dependent on those who have resorted to You, and as the [Final] Refuge [of Your devotees]!
Becoming visible to the eyes of these [devotees), You adorn Vanādri.
O [Lord] named Sundara! Ah! How wonderful it is!
123
Nothing is impossible for You!
Even though You know all about us You are compassionate and forgiving!
An insignificant person
unable to leave my sins
and without any other recourse, I am, therefore, dependent on You.
Forgive me,
for I have so little strength,

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
O Sundarabhuja! O Hari!

124
All by Yourself You brought back to life the monkeys killed in the battle of Lanka, the Brahmin's son, dead owing to the fault of Śiva, the dead son of Sandipani,
the Brahmin's young sons who went to Vaikuntha, and the child in the womb belonging to Arjuna.
Would one such as You
O Lord at Vanagiri fail to grant the desire
of my guru and me?
125
You caused the creatures belonging to Ayodhya together with the animals, insects and grass to go to Your own eternal worlds
which have a majesty
attainable only in the state of Final Liberation!
Now what [good] deeds [had they performed]? Rich in what kind of knowledge were they, O Lord at Vanagiri?
126
As the Boon-Bestower on Elephant Hill You gave sight to the man blind from birth
named Haritavaraṇabhṛtya
and, oh Sundara, truly in that same way,
You have openly [given sight]
to more than a hundred such [people]!

122

O Varada! O Sundara!
O Bearer of beautiful arms! O Lord!
Staying here on the slope surrounding Vanagiri
where Your glory is visible to all
You bestow excellent boons!
128
We hear that You Yourself
right here [in this very place] made King Malayadvaja Your devotee.
So also
[similar] desires [for devotion] are born [in us]!
129
O Lord at Vanagiri!
O Ocean of Compassion!
Please assent to my sincere [request]!
May I [once again] be in one corner of the Abode of Srirangam
absolutely subject to
Ramanuja the Noble just like before!
130
O Creator of Brahma! O Lord at Vanādri!
O Lord! O Sundara!
Looking to Your position
as the bestower of boons,
by all means hear [my request].

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
Enhancing day-after-day the glory of Srirangam and expressly refusing
the request of our adversaries, accomplish [things] in such a manner that [life there] becomes ever enjoyable for Your devotees!
131
O Nectar-ocean of Pity!
O Lord of the dharma!
O You of truthful intent!
O Possessor of Śri!
O Lord!
O Sundara!
O One Who has motherly affection
for good people!
Drive away all the worthless ones and forgiving in the twinkling of an eye all the offences committed by good people make the glory of the Srirangam Abode ever enjoyable [for Your devotees]!
132
[Although] I have committed sins
have no other recourse,
am foolish, without a refuge other than You,
am evil-hearted and evil-minded,
I shall solicit You openly and repeatedly
again and again and again
[until] I become a vessel of
Your boundless compassion, O Sundarabhuja! O Lord at Vanagiri!

NOTES
"Rāmānuja" (śrīrāma-avanuja, lit. "the younger brother of Śrirāma", that is, Lakṣmaṇa). Note that this is also the meaning of the name Rāmānuja.

Sundarabahu, Sundarabhuja and their synonyms are renderings into Sanskrit from the Sanskritized Tamil epithet (cuntarat tōluṭaiyan) contained in Aṇṭāļ, NTM 9.1, used in praise of the same icon that is the subject of Küresa's stotra. It is customary in Sanskrit literature for authors to intro- duce their literary compositions by mentioning: (1) visaya, or the subject of the work; (2) prayojana, or its purpose;
(3) sambandha, or the relationship of author to subject; and (4) adhikari, or the qualification of the author for writing the composition. Kūresa mentions all four in this stanza. The subject of his poem is the greatness of Lord Sundarabahu, and the purpose of the poem is its author's desire to see the Lord's feet. The author is related to his subject by his great desire to see his subject Sundara, and the poet's qualifica- tion to compose the poem is based both on his having taken refuge with the feet of Hari, and on his having obtained wisdom from his Acārya Rāmānuja.
Vanagiri and its synonyms Vanadri and Varasaila often function as proper names (referring to the holy site in its en- tirety). For that reason, the terms have been translated into English in some stanzas only.
"the moon's crawling round it like a child” (śaśadhara- rinkhaṇa). Two of the descriptions employed by Kūresa in this verse are based on Nammalvar's verses in praise of the same iconic incarnation: "... the sound of the conch (kural cankattu) shakes (the worlds] in the temple of Alakar (alakar-tam kōyil)." And again: "the moon crawls (mati taval) on the peak of the hill of Tirumaliruñcōlai (kuţumi maliruñcōlai in TVM 2.10.2).
The presence of divine damsels on this mountain is men- tioned in several Alvar hymns. For example, "divine damsels" (tevya makalirkal) come to the Nupura River (cilamparkka vantu) for bathing" (PĀTM 4.2.1).

In order to prevent confusion, I have generally preferred the more familiar names of the two gods Śiva and Brahma to the variety of names and epithets contained in the poems.
In this verse and in v. 68, Kūresa links Śiva -- with whom the archaic Tamil god Murukan is associated -- to the notion of "taint" or "pollution". According to Saiva mythology, Śiva has the crescent moon as his crest ornament. In Sanskrit court poetry, metaphors are often employed which play on the relation of the dark spots on the moon to the clean white disk. Kūreśa suggests that the moon's dark spots (that is, its defects) have been caused by its contact with Śiva because the moon is his crest ornament. Kūresa explicitly contrasts this defectiveness or pollutedness of the moon (which is said to come from its association with Śiva since it resides in his matted hair) with the untaintedness that results from the contact with Visņu. For a study of the concept of the "untaintedness" of the Lord in the early Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition, see Nayar 1992:82-86.
This verse is intelligible only in the context of PĀTM 4.2.5: "Tirumāliruñcōlai (that is, Vanagiri] -- where a black elephant in order to stop his mate, who was leaving him after a quarrel, shouted out in the name of the sea-blue coloured Lord Alakar [Sanskrit, Sundara] and had his mate turn back on hearing the Lord's name -- is the hill where dwells Lord Kṛṣṇa who once accepted the service of an ele- phant [whom he rescued from a crocodile] on the banks of a pond and who killed the elephant sent by Kamsa to destroy him" (translation by Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari).
Śrīvaiṣṇava devotees believe that even animals and inani- mate objects may be devoted to God. especially when they live in the environs of the Lord's dwelling places. In fact, they regard it preferable to be born as an animal or inanimate object in a sacred place than as a god in heaven (svarga). Kulacekara Alvar articulates this idea in PmalTM: "I who am enlightened shall not seek the transient human frame again. I shall seek to be a bird (kurukay) in the temple at Tirumalai. I do not pray for Indra's pomp surrounded by the immortal beauty of the nymphs and heaven (svarga) but

shall seek to be a fish in the streams of the Tirumalai Hills...". (Cited in Varadachari 1970:70). "that Indescribable Entity" (kim api vastu, lit. "some thing", "some one thing"). The indefinite is used in this stanza to express the limitless greatness and indescribability of the Lord.
21
"Long-stretching ears" (karṇa-pāśa) is one of the signs of a great man (mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa).
"The One upon Whom Sri has climbed or mounted" (prārūḍha-śriyam). Several synonymous epithets appear in this stotra: ārūḍha-śriḥ and adhyarudha-śriyam in vs. 17 & 24, samucchrita-śriyah in v. 41, and ārūḍha-lakṣmyāḥ in v. 57. All are Sanskrit variants of the Tamil name applied to Lord Sundarabahu contained in Antal, NTM 9.6 "[the Lord] upon whom Tiru (Śri) climbs" (ēru tiruvuṭaiyāṇ).
"The Immortal One" (amṛtam) may likewise be translated "Nectar." While "Immortal" would seem the more appro- priate within the context of Upanisadic epithets, Nammālvār calls the Lord "nectar" in his eulogy of Sundarabahu: "[He is] honey and milk and sugarcane and nectar" (tenum palum kannalum amutum) in TVM 8.8.4.
The first line of the stanza is a quotation from MaNārUp 11.3, reworded for purposes of metre.
Kūresa's interpretation of the "Great One" (bhūman) is founded on Ramanuja's ŚrīBh I.3.2.7.
In this verse, Kūresa follows Ramanuja's interpretation of daharamākāśam, the "subtle ether within the cavity of the heart", as denoting the Supreme Brahman rather than the individual soul. See ŚriBh I.3.5.13-22.
The conception of the phenomenal world expressed in this verse is based on Ramanuja's doctrine of seṣa-seṣi-bhāva. For a full discussion of Ramanuja's view, see Carman 1981: 147-57.
Rāmānuja teaches that all words, even those referring to insentient matter (acit), point to Visnu. ŚriBh I.1.6.13 states that "...those intelligent individual souls, who have particular masses of matter for their bodies, form modes of the Highest Self. Therefore they (that is, those words refer- ring to matter) finally include in their import the Highest

Self Himself. Thus the Highest Self Himself is denoted by all words".
According to the Pañcarātra Āgamas, the Lord, as Para Vasudeva, is sāntodita, that is, "inert"; the three subsequent creative cosmic emanations (vyūha), corresponding to the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe, are characterized by constant activity (nityodita) (LakṣmiTantra 2.49-51). By way of contrast, the Śrīvaiṣṇavas have their own interpretation of these two descriptions of the Lord: in the santodita state (as in this verse), God enjoys His own qualities only, while in the active nityodita state He enjoys His creation as well.
For "[the Lord] upon Whom Śrī has climbed", see v. 16. In this verse, Kūresa may be thinking of Nammālvär, who could only enjoy one quality of the Lord at a time; lost in this single quality, he would forget all others.
The idea that God shows the greatness of His mercy by ig- noring the limitless sins of His devotees is further devel- oped by Kūresa's great-grandson Vedācārya Bhaṭṭar in his poem Ksamāṣodasi (Stotramālā 1969:75-76). "shelter" (samśrita); “status of birth” (jāti); “nature" (svabhava). Compare this verse with Rāmānuja, BhGBh 9.29: "...With regard to taking shelter (samśrita) [with Me], no one deserves my hatred because (s)he is inferior in birth (jāti), form (akāra), nature (svabhāva), knowledge (jnāña)”. "those which are a hundred fold..." (ye te satam); "This One is not within the range of speech and mind" (na evaiṣaḥ varmanas-gocarah). The first phrase is a direct quotation from TaittUp 2.8; the second phrase is a restatement of TaittUp 2.9. This Upanisadic passage is often quoted in the Acāryas' praise-poems.
The image here of the combining of colours is based on the Tamilian practice of mixing three fruits (banana, mango, and jackfruit) on festive occasions. Poets say that the enjoyment that arises from a mixture of these three fruits, with honey added, resembles God's enjoyment of the universe. In the same way, the mixture of molten gold, emeralds, and col- lyrium, increases the enjoyment and beauty of each individ- ual item. Traditionally, the black of the collyrium is said to

128

represent Kṛṣṇa; emerald is symbolic of the reflection of the iconic Lord's beauty, and gold represents sheen and wealth. Although the beauty of these three can be enjoyed sepa- rately, the overall beauty is believed to be enhanced by their mixture (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkat- achari, November 1986).
41
See PATM 3.2.3. in which the Lord's body is compared to [a mixture of] gold and emeralds.
"Embellished by groves of growing young trees" (vardhīṣṇu-bāla-drūma-şanda-manditam) is based on Nam- māļvār, TVM 2.10.1 in which the place of Sundarabahu is described as "a dense garden surrounded by tender young trees" (valarilampolicul).
In the eulogy of important human beings such as kings, po- ets traditionally begin with the head, while for the part-by- part description of God, poets (out of humility) often begin with the feet. Notice that Kūresa, following several of the Āļvārs, reverses the accepted order.
42
For examples of this genre from DP, see Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7 and Tiruppāṇ Alvar, Aāp.
The reference to the Lord's hair thus, "[it] surpasses the de- scription of beautiful fibres fashioned from the essence of pitch-black blinding darkness", is based on Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.9 in which the author asks if he sees pitch-black darkness (irulai)... made into a mass of black threads (nīla nannül). He then replies that what he sees is really the lovely hair of the Lord.
For "[the Lord] upon Whom Śri has climbed", see v. 16.
The Lord's forehead reminds the poet of a half-moon both because of its shape and because of its glow. For identical imagery, see VRS, v. 32. See also Nammālvär, TVM 7.7.7 in which the Lord's forehead is compared to "a waxing moon in mid-fortnight".
The alankara employed by Kūresa in this verse is that ex- pressive of sandeha, or doubt. It is especially effective in in- voking wonder and confusion when confronted with the beauty of the Lord.
Similar comparisons of the Lord's eyebrows to bows are contained in Antal, NTM 14.6 and Nammal vär, TVM 7.7.4.

The area of the body from the collar bone to the chest is regarded as being very attractive. Its breadth and strength are features much admired in Indian wrestlers.
"a scar [made] by His bow-string" (jyakina). The Lord's four arms are described as having the "a scar [made] by His bow-string" (jyakiṇa) in Yamuna, SR, v. 33.
Kūresa's description of the conch as "resting on His lotus- palm...like an excellent royal swan" is based on Aṇṭāļ, NTM 7.7 which images the conch as "mounted on the palm of Vā-
sudeva's hand like a swan".
Fr. "the [Lord] upon Whom Lakṣmi has climbed or
mounted", see v. 16.
The similes comparing the navel to a whirlpool and breasts to elephant heads are not original to Kūresa, but are common in both Sanskrit and Tamil poetry.
The
paradox of the Lord Who swallowed all the worlds but yet has a thin waist fascinates Kūresa. Compare with VRS, v. 49.
The comparison of the human thigh to an elephant's trunk is a standard one in Sanskrit poetry.
The sacred site of Lord Sundarabahu is described as being "in a grove of sandal trees" (cantanappolilin) in Tirumańkai Āļvār, PTM 9.8.9.
The idea of defeat is conveyed by vs. 62-63. A defeated man is spoken of as being forced to carry the feet of his conqueror on his head. In that same way the lotus footrest, defeated in tenderness by the lotus-feet of the Lord, is forced to carry those feet on its "head".
While it is popularly believed that Śiva receives the heavenly Ganga on his head, according to Vaiṣṇavas he receives only the stream called Alakananda, which is the Ganga of India, and not the celestial Gangā (Wilson 1980:331). Compare with Yamuna, SR, v. 40, which also contains a play on the name Seṣa.

Kūresa's description of Visvaksena in this stanza is based on Yamuna, SR, v. 41.
The attendants [of the Lord] in Vaikuntha are said to have taken refuge with Sundarabahu because they are present in His temple. The Pañcarātra Agamic tradition requires that doorkeepers guard every temple entrance in order to prevent the entry of the wrong persons into the temple's Inner Sanc- tum. (Hari Rao 1967:101, 110, and 123).
Much of the vocabulary of this verse is identical to Rāmānuja, VaiGad, para. 4.
"salvation" (ātma-sanjīvana, lit. "revivification of the soul”). Kūresa employs here the term found two times in the last three paragraphs of Ramanuja's VaiGad.
This verse, a rendering of Tirumankai Āļvār, PTM 11.4.1, contains the same number of syllables per line (23) (Aṇṇankarācāriyar 1965).
Kūresa's phrase "a spot on the moon called tusk" is a reference to one of the marks on the moon which is said to resemble a boar's tusk.
The cutting of the king's thousand arms by Parasurama (Bhargava) is described in Tirumankai Alvar, PTM 5.6.7. 107 Kūresa's mention of Nila as "suitable [for You] because of
her family” (nīlā kulena sadṛsi), confirms her identity with Nappinnai/Pinnai of the indigenous Tamil tradition.
While Rukmiņi is mentioned in Nammālvār, TVM only once, and twice only in PATM, Nappinnai is mentioned by these authors more than 150 times (Annankarācāriyar 1965).
Kṛṣṇa's being born to one woman, and raised by another is referred to by Antal in TP, v. 25.
112 Here Kūresa refers to an episode in which Krsna became angry because he wanted to hide His supremacy, but His friends still questioned Him about it. Anṇankarācāriyar notes that there are parallel ideas in the BhP, although seemingly not elsewhere (1965).
120 Śrīvaiṣṇavas interpret the intensity and poignancy of
Küresa's request for God to descend on earth as Kalki "right here before our eyes" in the context of the trouble in Srirangam implied in vs. 129-31.

Praise-Poem to the Beautiful-Armed [Lord]
122 "You adorn" (paricaskarişe, past perfect, 2nd singular),
translated according to the gloss in PSV, alankaroși (present, 2nd singular).
131
126 The traditional interpretation of vs. 126-27 is that Kūresa is
praying for the restoration of his own sight. According to Srivaiṣṇava hagiographical literature, Kūresa was blinded by an evil Saiva king (known only as Krmikantha or "the worm-necked one"), who persecuted the Vaiṣṇava commu- nity during the era of Rāmānuja.
128 "made Your devotee" (carana-satkṛtavan, lit. "one who was
reduced to Your feet").
129 This verse and the two which follow it substantiate the tra-
ditional Śrīvaisnava view that this stotra was composed
when Kūresa was in exile in Vanagiri during a time of trouble in Śrirangam.
130 Kūresa's words "enhancing day-after-day the glory of Śrī- rangam" (śriranga-sriyam anvaham praguṇayan) are recited at the conclusion of all Śrīvaiṣṇava public recitations of the hymns of the Āļvārs.
132 "Offences committed by good people" may refer to the be-
trayal of Kūresa by his own disciple Nālūrān, who is said to have pointed out Kūresa and his teacher Ramanuja to some Śaivas who came searching for them on behalf of the king (see n.126). This story is contained in several late hagio- graphies, and was related to me by K.K.A. Venkatachari.

Varadaraja Stava
May Hari
1
crown jewel on the crest of Elephant Hill the God Whom the Upanisads called unequalled and unsurpassed bestow welfare on me always!
2
I take refuge with Devaraja
the Overlord [of the universe] an Ocean of compassion
and the Friend of all creatures, Who has Śrī as His treasure
[and is Himself] an inexhaustible treasure vowed to bestow upon His suppliants everything they desire!
3
That eternal Splendour
Who transcends apprehension by the senses,
cannot be understood even by yogis,
and is difficult to comprehend
even in the Upanisads
is visible [here]
on the peak of Elephant Hill!

to the Boon-Bestower King
4
I take shelter with that sweet Varada
of Elephant Hill
Whom the creeper
in the form of the best of Śrutis is fond of imitating
with its own splendour
and with its branches containing
manifold shoots sprouted forth.
5
I resort to that Hill of the Elephant which makes visible [to us]
He of whom the Triad speaks
by way of its instruction
as imperceptible
by refuting other descriptions [of Him] with the words "not this, not this" (neti neti).
6
While to unfortunate ones
the Three Vedas may not [appear to] demonstrate that [Viṣṇu] is Lord,
who would not conclude
in the Abode of the Elephant
that Devaraja is Lord indeed?
How wonderful!
7
The Hill of the Elephant removes the doubt
of those whose minds are influenced
by erroneous philosophies
[as to whether] Hari
the abode of lofty and auspicious qualities is with attributes
or without.

133
8
By means of maxims, syllogisms
and the refined sayings of eminent sages, the Three Vedas might with difficulty enable sinless people
to devote [themselves] to Hari, [but] the Abode of the Elephant
[enables] everyone [to enjoy Him].
9
That which is forcefully proclaimed by the words:
"There is an Entity extremely wonderful,
great, of boundless nature and incomparable..." is [itself] truly seen
right in front [of us]
in the Abode of the Elephant.
10
Even in the opinion of those who regarded the Triad
as a means to valid knowledge that accords well with other proofs
[such as perception and inference], the Three Vedas have now become a means to valid knowledge with regard to the Highest Reality [solely] because of Hasti Hill.
11
Here in this world
an entity endowed with good qualities is considered auspicious because of those qualities.
In You, O Lord of Hasti Hill, [it is precisely] the opposite!

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
On the authority of Śruti
we have concluded that Your qualities beginning with truth and knowledge have become auspicious
[only] after coming to reside in You.
12
Your Supreme Form
established in the acme of Śruti
as the Supreme Brahman
sinless, incomparable, always serene, pure, ever untouched by defects,
and beyond the range of speech and mind, is visible [right here in Hastigiri], O Varada!
13
Seeking to touch upon
Your highest incomparable form
which imitates the state of a rippleless ocean by becoming immovable in conformity with the glory and abundant bliss
arising from the experience
of Your own serene and infinite Self,
the Three Vedas become extremely exhausted in denying [the existence of] other
[inauspicious qualities] in You,
O Varada!
14
That Highest Reality is described as difficult to speak about,
impossible to hear or think about
to want to worship,
to see, touch, or enjoy, O Varada.

135
Varadaraja Stava
136
Oh! How is it, then, that You stand here visible atop the Hill of the Elephant for the sake of all?
15
The group of the six principal qualities (includes]
exalted knowledge, incomparable strength, supreme lordliness, limitless bravery,
the mightiest power, and the highest splendour,
O Varada!
[You] are the birthplace
of limitless auspicious qualities
that defy enumeration!
O Varada!
16
O One with three pairs of qualities!
Your original form shone
with these six qualities.
Then, three [of Your forms] shone
each with a pair [of qualities].
This arrangement
[arises] out of Your desire
to reveal [Yourself to the devotees].
Otherwise You are everywhere possessed of countless and abundant auspicious qualities.
17
The stage described in the previous [stanza] pertains to Your
[four-fold] creative cosmic emanation.

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
137
Then descending among gods, humans and animals in order to play at [Your own] will
in the midst of the realms of finite beings
who are under Your rule,
You become similar to them
and assume the designation" vibhava "
Although replete with
multitudes of excellent qualities,
You conceal [some of] them,
O Lord of the Elephant!
18
O Precious Varada!
Regardless of the form You take --
the transcendent God
a creative cosmic emanation an occasional incarnation
an incarnation in a worshippable icon
or the soul's Indweller --
You always appear to Your worshippers bearing multitudes of excellent, lordly qualities [but] to others [you appear] otherwise.
19
Excellent, limitless, countless auspicious qualities enabling Your devotees to easily obtain You such as compassion, patience, generosity, tenderness, impartiality towards all, friendliness, constancy, graciousness, love, and authority and the highest auspicious qualities
beginning with beauty,
O Varadaraja,
elicit delight in the people bowed down [before You].

138
Varadaraja Stava
20
Vedic verses have sung of Your unique independence, but we regard You as dependent because You are subject to
those who seek shelter with You.
Oh! Oh! This reproach rests
on Your omniscience alone [because being omniscient
You see our offences],
yet You never take into consideration any fault in Your devotees here [in this world],
O Varada!
21
You appear over Elephant Hill like its black-as-collyrium peak
O Varada
with Your hands, feet, face and eyes surpassing lotuses [in loveliness], and with Your arms
rivaling mighty tamāla trees
(in beauty and strength].
22
My eyes feast on the One Who has
illustrious arms and an attractive nose
good shoulders adorned with lovely long ears long eyes and noble cheeks
O Best among the boon-granters!
23
Resembling a dark cloud
reclining on [the golden serpent] Ananta -- Your hair black like a lump of collyrium

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
and Your eyes, hands and feet resembling lotus blossoms -- become forever visible to me, O Lord of the Elephant!
139
24
My skin and eyes desire to drink You in while my tongue is distressed
at not being able to hear You like an ear.
My nose, too, is in that same condition regarding You.
O Lord of the Elephant!
How in the world can I reach
the state [that I so long for]!
O Lord!
25
Indicating Your supreme overlordship
of [all] the worlds,
Your crown becomes a high-rising mountain for the thousand-rayed [sun]
that is Your crest jewel,
O Omament of Hasti [Hill]!
O Varada!
26
Do You wear an ūrdvapuṇḍra mark
on Your own forehead
out of high regard for its power
made known by its vertical position indicating its upliftment of Your devotees?
140
27
O Lord of the Elephant!
Is your earring
an embellishment for Your ear
a decoration for Your shoulders
Varadaraja Stava
an adornment for Your shoulder-length hair
or an ornament for my heart?
28
The splendour of the gold bracelets and armlets
fastened on your arms
emulates the richness of flowers bloomed all over
the branches of the boon-bestowing tree,
O Lord of the Elephant!
29
When the pearl necklace quivers on Your chest, Kaustubha and Kamalā
the two [who reside there]
are reduced to the [same] condition [experienced] at the moment of their coming forth
from the foamy ocean
which was moving to-and-fro
at being churned [by You],
O Lord of the Elephant!
O Varada!
30
As if the valley of a collyrium mountain
were made of gold,
the glory of the golden garment
glitters [on Your black body], imitating a flash of lightning!

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
O Varada!
31
Today we see in You
the dark night
followed by the bright side of the sun.
Indeed, the dark hue of Your hair
is the [black] backside
of the [shining] sun
in the form of Your face.
141
32
The eighth lunar day which removes the inequality
of both the moon's fortnights
has made for the [half-] moon's glory because it has become a standard of comparison
O Varada
for the splendour of Your forehead.
33
The good ink taken up [by the creator Brahmā]
with a desire to fashion Your rows of curls
was tested on the touchstone
of Your broad forehead.
[The streaks left there] became Your eyebrows.
O Varada!
This could not really be so
because [Your form] is uncreated.
34
Your senses are free from
the limitations of ordinary creatures.

142
You can hear with Your eyes
and see with Your ears!
Varadaraja Stava
That's why Your [exceedingly long] eyes have resorted to Your ears!
O Varada!
35
Your nose is a bridge
over the rippling ocean of Your eyes whose billows in the form of sidelong glances are flowing with the sentiment of compassion
and streaming with love-filled currents!
Your eyebrows are rows of forests [stretched] on its sprawling shores.
36
A sidelong glance from Your eyes, O Varada,
manifests Your majesty
spreads forth radiance
reveals Your boundless compassion
rains down rapture
and melts the hearts [of Your devotees].
37
The brilliance of Your moon-like teeth shining on the petal of Your pink lower lip
O Lotus-eyed One
manifests a splendour
surpassing [the lustre of] a string of pearls [placed] over a [piece of] coral.

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
38
The gentle waterfall of Your smile cascades onto the raised ground of Your [broad] chest
and when dispersed there
bears the beauty of a many-stringed garland.
O Varada!
Your pearl necklace appears
like a river sprung from it.
39
O Varada, Your cheeks
kissed by the much-desired cowherdesses who adorned the circle of the rasa [dance] are [even now] puffed up
because of the thrill that continues
from [the joy of] that time!
40
May Your face
which has a prominent and attractive nose
long eyes
teeth showing through Your smile
a lustrous lower lip
arched brows
and ears reaching down
to Your shining shoulders
remain in me forever,
O Lord of the Elephant!
143
41
When the Lotus-Lady linked her arm with Yours
inspired by the sentiment of love
what indescribable state did Your neck
as beautiful as a conch

144
and highly esteemed [by her] experience then,
O Lord at Karigiri?
42
Varadaraja Stava
O Varada!
Your four boon-bestowing arms
[strong] like iron bars
gleam like the dark [branches of] a tamāla tree.
Or are they [broad] like expansive oceans
stretched out wide
or do they openly shine like the four directions?
43
Ah Varada,
[Tell me!]
Did Your arms meet with their greatest joy
in the embrace of Indira?
in clasping the cowherdesses
during the ardently desired rasa dance?
or in being tied down by Yasoda for the offence of stealing fresh butter?
O Varada!
44
Your arms shine with reddish finger-tips
like the branches of a sala tree
which has finger-tips in
the form of tender sprouts

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
like the billows of an ocean topped with [pink] corals
and like superior serpents
their faces aglow with their hood-gems.
45
You churned the ocean
with Your own [hands].
Moreover,
You held aloft for seven nights the mountain [Govardhana]
and twisted the necks
of the seven bulls.
Even then, O Varada,
Your hands did not grow tired.
O Varada!
46
Was the red tint of Your hands
caused by Your crawling
in the courtyards and houses of Vraja?
from gripping the stick
for controlling the cows
in the cowherders' cowpens?
or from holding onto the goad and reins while driving the [chariot] horses?
O Varada!
47
Is it for decoration or [simply] out of joy that You perpetually carry the overlords

145
Varadaraja Stava
146
that are Your weapons
who are omniscient,
have all the appropriate powers,
have made a vow to serve You forever
and have You as their sole enjoyment?
48
Was Your chest the creator [Brahma's] model for fashioning the sky, O Varada?
[that chest] on which
the Lotus Lady's face and the kaustubha gem are manifest as the moon and the sun,
and whose garland behaves like
a constellation of stars,
O Best among the boon-granters!
49
Good people declare that Your stomach is the [resting] place of the Cosmic Eggs.
If that be so, O Varada,
then how is its thinness
[to be explained]?
The enrichment of those here in this world
[whose greatness] is self-created
would lead to an increase in [size and] glory.
But that's not so
for others [like Yourself]!
50
O Lotus-naveled One! O Varada! Your navel must be a whirlpool
created by the rush of rasa
flowing from Your ambrosial beauty.

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
The lotus [arising from Your navel] shines as the abode of the lovely Laksmi
who is fond of Your entire wonderful form.
51
That very rope which gave You the name "Damodara"
left a callus [on Your body].
O Varada!
Under the guise of three lines
[that mark] has become
the foremost ornament of Your waist.
52
147
O Lord of Hasti[śaila]!
The earth bears fruit
according to the kind of seed that is sown in it
and we see that [same principle
at work] in You also.
O Lotus-faced One!
The lotus being [continually] created in Your belly
in which resides the [Cosmic] Egg
brings forth multitudes of unbroken eggs!
53
O Lord of the sacrifice!
Although I am an ignorant man,
somewhere I have encountered the question
"Who among the many [gods]
is the Supreme Overlord of the universe?"
We [now] proclaim the final conclusion: "Brahma and the other [gods]
about whom a clamorous debate

148
among the people has arisen are born, O Varada,
from the lotus arising from
Varadaraja Stava
the bulb in the form of Your stomach."
54
O Kṛṣṇa! O Varada!
O [Lord] fit to be won over
by Your own dear people!
That rope with which You were tightly bound
by the hands of Yasoda for stealing fresh butter and which is the destroyer
of Your devotees' bondage
You even today wear
out of love for Your mother
as an ornament of the body called a waistband.
55
A river called "Beauty" spread out on Your chest and was halted midway by Your pit-like navel from which a whirlpool arises
due to the uneven movement [of the water] in such a small space.
[From there that river] spread out [once again] and after reaching Your broad hips
becomes diversified into the streams [that flow] through the regions of Your feet, O Lord of Hasti Hill!
O Varada!
56
[Ordinary standards of comparison such as gracefully tapering] hands excellent emerald pillars

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
plantain-tree trunks
and the trunks of the choicest elephants even though in the bloom of youth do not compare entirely favourably with Your broad thighs,
nor do they impart their majesty.
O Varada!
57
A river of luminosity was born in Your body and its two streams vanish
at [the tips of] Your two feet.
Your knees resemble whirlpools
born from it
bubbling up from below,
or perhaps they are two bullock humps named "Youth" and "Wealth".
58
In order to kiss affectionately the peak of Elephant Hill,
Your legs are behaving like the stems of the two lotuses facing downward called Your feet.
The delight elicited
by the touch of the mountain
has made Your leg hairs
bristle like thorns
[on the stems] of Your ankles.
How can the person who sees You
O Varada
bear to leave [Your presence]?

149150
Varadaraja Stava
O Varada!
59
Among these [bestowers of] exceeding delight which do Your lotus-feet prefer?
the bright lotus named "Dahara"
[situated] in the body of Your devotees,
Your lotus-seat which, although seated perpetually,
remains unfaded,
the pinnacle of the Vedas (Upanisads),
the head of Saṭhāri,
or the peak of Elephant Hill?
O Varada!
60
The toes of Your feet have all the splendour of a series of [sea] billows
bordering the [glistening] water's edge.
Does the moon cause Your toes to shine
from its reflection on the rows of Your toenails?
or under the pretext of reflecting itself
on Your nails,
does the moon [really] reach Your toenails thus making them glitter?
61
O Lotus-faced One!
O Lover of the sacrifice!
The moon
defective, imperfect, vile, and crooked on account of being the friend of Siva and serving him
approached Your lotus-feet
under the guise of Your toenails, O Varada,

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
and became purified, perfect in conduct, eternal, and the possessor of ten auspicious qualities.
62
Long ago the river of the gods (Gargā)
sprung from Your lotus-foot
separated into four [streams].
Taking three paths,
the single [stream] borne by Dhruva
purified the three worlds.
One from among those three [streams]
going through the sky
purifies Śiva.
She divided again into seven [streams];
one purified this earth
and enabled Sagara's sons to reach heaven, O Varada!
63
Attendants, retinue, ornaments and weapons, the multitudes of auspicious qualities
beginning with knowledge end creative power, the Supreme Abode, the [Cosmic] Eggs,
Your own body and so also Your soul --
You made all this
for the sake of those who take refuge [with You], O Boon-bestower!
64
There is nothing [to be] gained by You that is not already Yours, O Varada!

151
152
Varadaraja Stava
Your creative actions
involving the generation, preservation and annihilation of all the worlds flash forth from Your mind.
Nevertheless, You descend here [to live] among the multitudes of inferior gods and human beings, in order to embrace people
who seek refuge [with You]
and to destroy those who trouble them.
O Varada!
65
Even the slightest trace of desire
may destroy the discrimination of the mind.
When that same desire is great --
what then?
O Varada!
Raising up Partha and the like
to be Your own person
You have descended into this unworthy world
and embrace him!
O Varada!
66
Unable to suffer delay in embracing
[Your devotees]
and not even allowing them enough time
to be purified,
You, most excellent among the patient ones, were so eager to take them immediately
to Your own Abode [of Vaikuntha] that You descended here.

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
But what is this?
You woo even those
who haven't taken shelter with You, yielding Your body to them!
O Varada!
67
Being beyond [apprehension by] the senses, if You were not to descend into this world then Your worship, praise and so forth
decreed by Śruti
would be abandoned.
68
O Protector!
O Varada!
Hiranya perpetually committed
a thousand offences against You, but You [remained] unaffected [by him] for a long, long time.
[Yet] on account of [Hiranya's]
troubling of a small boy,
You underwent change
[and responded] immediately taking the form of a Man-Lion.
69
O Ocean of the nectar of compassion!
O Bestower of boons!
Poets declare that You can be attained
only by [the disciplines of]
knowledge, works, and devotion, and not by other [means].

153
154
By which of these [ways] did Uttarakośala's creatures
-- including even the grass -- reach You?
Varadaraja Stava
70
O Bestower of boons!
On account of the strength
of Your motherly affection for the devotees, You Who are anxiously desirous
[of proximity to them]
may willingly descend here [to earth]
so as to become easily accessible to them.
Oh! But what is this?
Long ago, being tied with a rope,
You wept!
71
The extraordinary body of the Man-Lion which was contained in the pillar
and manifested at the very same instant
as Your devotee's speech
[on Your all-pervasiveness] proves Your supremacy, O Varada!
O Eternal One!
72
I am being consumed by the three-fold forest fire! I am confused and, not knowing my limits, am able neither to stand firmly [here in saṁsāra]
nor to be involved in efforts
to approach You for protection.

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
O Lord! O Lord of Hasti (Hill]!
Please cover me with the [cooling] rainshower of the ambrosia of Your sidelong glances!
73
[Pulled] in various wrong ways and in contradictory directions, I am being forcibly torn asunder by hundreds of useless desires [appearing in me] simultaneously!
I do not even have desire for [refuge in] Your feet!
O Lord of Hastigiri!
I do not even seek my own welfare!
74
Oh Boon-Bestower!
Without fear and without modesty
because my obstinate mind has no desire
for [refuge at] Your feet,
and adored as I am with the armour of evil deeds, I prattle something before You!
75
Diseases of the body and mental agony,
insatiability [of the senses],
the gain of things I do not wish for,
the loss of much-desired objects,
and inferiority [feelings] which make for anger
all these continually torture my mind
O Lord of Hasti [Hill]
but loss of the treasure of Your affection [does not trouble me at all].

155
156
Varadaraja Stava
76
The birthplace of contempt and arrogance
lust and passion,
greed and delusion,
I am sinking here in [the sea of] saṁsāra, O Lord beyond dualities!
Who am I to resort to You,
to see and seek to attain You
Who are possessed of eternal, flawless, and abundant auspicious qualities, O Lord of the Elephant!
77
I am inwardly consumed by
unavailing and meaningless brooding
over how my sons and others will be when I am dead.
But, O Lord of Hastigiri,
there is not even an iota of consideration
as to how I myself shall be!
78
Because of the strength of my evil inclinations
arising from the mental impressions
of previous births
my mind is not able to abandon [the world] even while analyzing happiness
arising from the sense organs
in which defects
such as lightning-like transitoriness abundant sorrow
the cause of calamity
and triviality
are [clearly] seen,
O Boon-Bestower Emperor!

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
79
By leaving undone
what is enjoined [in the scriptures] and by doing what is prohibited
intentionally or unintentionally
157
with hundreds of unbearable offences against You and with hundreds of sins
in thought, word, and deed uncountable even by You committed against the devotees, O Lord of Hasti [Hill],
I am doomed!
80
[Although] servitude to You is natural to me
I -- such as I am --
formerly erred
robbing You [of my state of servitude], [yet] You [still] considered me Your own.
O Lord of the Elephant!
Put to rest this dispute of ours!
81
O Lord of Hasti (Hill]!
Great connoisseur of Your service [that I am],
may I consider enjoyments
such as equality with Brahma and Śiva
or the liberation referred to as
the experience of one's own soul
the equal of salt water!
82
Helpless and shelterless,
wallowing [as I am]
in the ocean of worldly existence --

158
Varadaraja Stava
filled with a profusion of the poisonous snakes
of sensual enjoyments
and a repository of the crocodiles
of birth and death --
I choose You as my refuge,
O Bestower of boons!
83
Filled with thousands of inauspicious qualities,
beyond the pale of even an iota
of a [single] auspicious quality,
and a great sinner who has not performed
[any] good deeds,
I choose You
O Varada of great compassion [to be] my refuge!
84
The [very] word uttered by me
[in] choosing [You as] my refuge
was spoken by me without forethought.
O Varada!
If You nevertheless consider me
worthy of Your compassion,
then am I saved!
85
If one's mind were contrite
with respect to countless crimes committed,
then, O Varada,
we do not doubt
that You [would] take pity!
[But] we who have unrepentant minds are doomed indeed!

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
O Varada!
86
I have no better, easily available means
that would grant me the One for Whom I long than the uttering of the word "refuge" (saraṇam).
This is the opportunity
for [You to show me] Your compassion.
87
I am attached to worldly objects
and am a person of great sensual desire, but I have not even the faintest [longing] for [taking refuge at] Your feet.
Therefore, O Varada,
it is Your responsibility [to see that] desire for Your feet is created in me.
O Varada!
88
Even [the desire to utter] the word "refuge” (śaraṇam)
a revivifying thought
would not arise without Your grace.
[From this I know]
that you are inclined
to show Your grace to me.
89
O Varada, grant me whatever I desire
here [in samsara]
so long as it is not an obstacle to the attainment of Your feet.

159160
Otherwise, O Lord, grant [me] at once
Your foot alone.
Varadaraja Stava
90
Do grant me whatever else I pray for out of a helplessness caused by hundreds of evil inclinations
arising from the mental impressions of previous births!
O [Lord] of unequalled compassion! O Benefactor of all!
O Granter of everything!
O Bestower of boons!
O Ocean of forgiveness!
91
Whether and in whatever manner You grant me
the thing I desire or something else
O Lord Varada
experiencing [whatever you give]
is only appropriate for me
because I -- such as I am --
have placed upon You the entire responsibility [for my welfare].
92
O Lord of the Elephant!
I choose to behold You
Who are difficult to attain
for those who are not Your devotees
just as You are --
whatever your form or size Whoever You are

whatever Your auspicious qualities and glory whatever actions You perform --
solely by [my utterance of] the word "surrender".
Oh!
93
O Compassionate One!
O Varada!
O Ocean of forgiveness!
and especially O Benefactor of all persons!
O Granter of everything!
O Knower of what is beneficial [for the devotees]!
O Omniscient One!
O Possessor of all powers!
Having removed at once
[all my other desires],
lead me to [the condition of]
Your servitude alone!
94
O Lord of Hasti [Hill]!
Your compassion is such that
You make those who worship You
by virtue of their own qualities
by their own deeds
on the basis of their own knowledge
or out of devotion to You
[Your servants].
That being so, I regard Your compassion itself as my support.

O Varada!
If one such as I were to obtain Your feet, then Your auspicious qualities

O Lord of Hasti [Hill]!
May we hear Your cool and soothing
nectar-like words which
having quenched the thirst of all the senses penetrate into the region of the mind becoming eternally rooted [there].

O Lord of the Elephant!
In all places, at all times, and in all conditions, may I always remain near You
with my mind unattached to anything else

all kinds of Your service.
Ah! Varada!
99
When will a continuous series
of the waves of Your sidelong glances from the two rivers that are Your eyes
flowing with streams
of the sentiments of uncreated love which diffuses all around
and is a remover of fatigue be poured out upon this person?

O Lord of Hasti (Hill]!
For more than a hundred years

How may I attain Your [Supreme] Abode which is inconceivable,

I have resorted to the feet of Ramanuja,
the foremost light of the sage Yamuna's lineage.
[Yamuna] is from the line of Natha[muni],
who belongs to the lineage of the sage Parankusa
the servant of [Śri] Your Queen.
Therefore, O Varada,
I am looked upon by You
as Your very own!
NOTES
The Supreme Brahman is described as “unequalled" and "unsurpassed" in ŚvetUp 6.8.
Kūresa refers to "Elephant Hill" or "Hill/Abode/Rock of the Elephant(s) by a variety of nearly synonymous epithets (hasti-giri, hasti-saila, hasti-kṣitidhara, hasti-dhama, kari- giri, kari-saila). These references (and those contained in Rāmānuja's teacher Kāñcīpurṇa's Devarājāṣṭakam) are the earliest in Sanskrit literature.
Raman presents us with convincing etymology of these Sanskrit place names. According to Raman, the area sur- rounding the Varadaraja Swami Temple was first known as Attiyur (or Tiruvattiyur), and this name occurs in Putat Ālvār's ITA, vs. 95-96. Inscriptional evidence from the temple records shows that as early as C.E. 1129 the hymns of that Alvar were, indeed, connected with the temple.
Vaiṣṇavas endow atti wood (Sanskrit, udambara) with a special significance; many Agamic texts on iconography prescribe it as the most suitable material from which to construct an icon. According to Raman, Vaiṣṇavas regard these trees as manifestations of Viṣņu Himself, which he es- tablishes by referring to VSN which contains the name "Udambara" (Raman 1975:4-5). (It must be noted, how- ever, that this particular etymology of that name of Viṣṇu

Praise-Poem to the Boon-Bestower King
165
must have been lost by the time of the early Acaryas, for Bhattar makes no mention of the connection in his BhGD, No. 827).
Raman suggests that the original name for Hastigiri, that is Attiyur, was derived from the name of this wood, for the sthala purāṇa of Varadaraja Swami Temple mentions that the area was once filled with atti trees and that the original image of the deity (named Attivaradar) was made of atti wood.
Commenting on the name Hastigiri, Raman notes: "Thus, the etymology of place-name has had a chequered evolution. The simple Tamil name of Attiyur, glorified by the Ālvār, had to undergo a painful course of Sanskritisation to be- come Hastipura and then Hastigiri, and then the latter was again Tamilized as Attigiri! Curiously, the latter word is a hybrid, neither purely Sanskrit nor Tamil. Atti is Tamil (and may refer to the atti tree or an elephant) but giri, mean- ing "hill", is Sanskrit; when the word Hastigiri attained popularity in Vaishnavite literature, the legendary story of the elephant [that is, the tale of Gajendra] was probably tagged on to it because hasti in Sanskrit means elephant. This legend has attained currency so much that the signifi- cance of the original Tamil word, Attiyur, was lost" (Raman 1975:5-6).
The inclusion of the term "hill" (giri) in the Sanskrit name is derived from the traditional belief that the main sanctuary of the temple is built over a small hillock. The main shrine of the temple, which houses Lord Varadaraja, is above ground level, standing on the top of a square walled-in platform, a raised enclosure 30 square metres in size, and 10 metres in height. Whether it is a natural hillock or an artifi- cially raised mound -- perhaps a Jaina or Buddhist stupa? - is not known, and archaelogical investigation of the area has been prohibited by the Government of India.

In the 14th century, Vedanta Deśika composed a stotra in praise of Varadaraja which was heavily influenced by Kūr- esa's VRS. See his Varadaraja Pañcāśat in Stotramālā or the English translation of the same by Filliozat 1992. Filliozat's translation of the synonymous epithets Hastigiri,

Varadaraja Stava
etc. (Hill of elephants), is based on the sthala-purāņa story which connects the shrine to a sacrifice performed there by the elephants of the four directions. In my translation (Hill of the Elephant), I have preferred to emphasize the elephant Gajendra's long-standing connection with the shrine. "Visible...invisible" (parokṣa...aparoksa). In their more general meaning, these terms may be taken to refer to all of the senses, and may be translated as "perceptible... imper- ceptible".
According to popular Śrīvaiṣṇava thought, "the unfortunate ones" would be those people on whom the glance of God did not fall at the time of birth. On the other hand, fortunate people are those on whom the glance of God did fall at the time of birth, creating in them the desire for moksa and Vaikuntha. The choice is entirely up to God. "four-fold creative cosmic emanation" (vyuha). This stanza contains the earliest extant Śrīvaiṣṇava reference (in technical terminology) to all five forms of Vişņu. The two categories of qualities mentioned here -- "the most excellent qualities" (vara-gunaḥ) and "the highest qualities" (uttama-gunāḥ) -- are applied loosely, and do not function in the Śrīvaiṣṇava tradition as technical terms.
The idea expressed in this stanza is similar to that of PĀTM 4.9.2, which traditional interpretation regards as revealing the Lord's independence: "Even if the Lotus-Lady, who mediates their cases, tells the faults of his devotees, the Lord may say 'My servants would not do that; and if they did, they did it for good" " (translation by Ate).
See also Poykai Alvār, MTA, v. 1: "Even if a person commits mistakes [as big as] a mountain, God will take into account only the good things".
The imagery in this verse is based on TVM 6.6.6, in which the Lord's crown is compared to a golden mountain. There are two kinds of pundras (marks or signs): the urdhva ("tending or rising upwards"), that is the "vertical" mark worn by Vaisnavas, and the tiryak ("horizontal") mark worn by Saivas. According to Śrīvaisnava understanding, the vertical mark encourages thinking on elevated topics such as mokṣa, while the horizontal mark of the Saivas en-

28

courages thinking of the things of this world (Aṇṇankar- ācāriyar 1970).
167
The two groups of Śrīvaiṣṇavas today (Tenkalai and Vaṭakalai) wear marks of slightly different shapes. Note that this verse does not describe the precise shape of the mark. Indeed, discussion of the Tenkalai and Vaṭakalai forms of the mark does not appear in literature until well af- ter the 13th century (From an interview with Prof. K.K.A. Venkatachari, October, 1986).
Kūresa evokes a sense of wonder in this verse by the em- ployment of the saṁdeha-alankāra, which involves the doubt as to whether the thing described is "this thing", "that thing" or "yet another thing".
The description of the parts of the Lord's body in this sec- tion of the stotra may be compared to Yamuna, SR, vs. 32- 36, and especially v. 34.
The poet's wonder as to whether or not the earring is a decoration for the Lord's shoulders is an oblique reference to the the length of the His ears, amahā-purusa-lakṣaṇa (sign of a great man).
The Lord's shoulders are likewise compared to a kalpaka tree (Tamil, karpaka) in Nammāļvār, TVM 6.6.6. The Lord is described likewise as resembling "a dark cloud filled with lightning" in PĀTM.8.1.
According to traditional Indian thought, one side of the sun is thought to be dark, and the other bright.
Literally, this verse reads "With regard to Your eyes and ears for the grasping of sound and form, the regulation is not like that [for ordinary] creatures. [Your eyes and ears] have the capability of seeing/perceiving all; therefore, Your two eyes have resorted to Your two ears".
The image of the eyes resorting to (that is, reaching up to) the ears is an indirect praise of very long eyes, the sign of a great man (maha-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa).
The phrase "melts the hearts [of the devotees]" (ārdra-bhā- vam) literally means "makes wet or moist". Aṇṇankar- ācāriyar (1970) glosses it with the Tamil word iram, meaning "...love, affection, attachment... grace, mercy, favour" (MTL, I, 380).

The teeth of the Lord are frequently compared to "pearls" and His lip to a piece of coral by the Alvārs. See PATM 2.2.2. and Nammāļvār, TVM 7.7.3.
According PSV, the imagery of this verse is related to the episode of Visnu's churning of the ocean. When Śri
(Padma, the Lotus-Lady) came out of the ocean which was being churned, she clung to Visnu's neck with one arm, and linked her other arm in his.
This is the only explicit reference in the stotras of Kūresa and Bhattar to the Tamil story of Kṛṣṇa's twisting of the necks of the seven bulls in order to win Nappinnai's hand in marriage. While the Sanskrit equivalent of the name Nappinnai is never mentioned in the stotras, she is identified on the Sanskritic side of the tradition with Nīlā.
Kṛṣṇa's driving of the [chariot] horses is a reference to his role as Arjuna's charioteer in BhG.
A thin waist is a mahā-puruṣa-lakṣaṇa. Here it is especially significant because Visnu's stomach remains thin in spite of His having eaten the Cosmic Eggs, that is, swallowed the universe.
"the fine, bright lotus" (daharaṁ paṇḍitam pundarikaṁ) See ChUp2.1.1 yatpundarikam...daharam.
"Your own body and so also Your soul" (atmadehastatha ātmā) is glossed by Aṇṇankarācāriyar (1970) with the words svāsātāran vikrahamumtivyātmasvarūpum.
Compare with Rāmānuja's concept of incarnation in BhGBh IV.8 & 11. The Lord's incarnations (whether occasional or iconic) are always directly linked to the enjoyment and satis-
faction of His devotees.
God is said to have taken Partha (Arjuna) as His "own per- son" because Kṛṣṇa was interested in Draupadi. The Śri- vaiṣṇava Acāryas teach that the Pandavas were no better than Duryodana. Only Kṛṣṇa's interest in Draupadi caused him to side with the Pāṇḍavas.
"The three-fold forest fire" is glossed in PSV with the words: (1) adhyatmika or diseases; (2) adhibhūtika or troubles caused by other creatures; and (3) adhidevika or climate.

The three kinds of afflictions have their origin in Saṁkhya philosophy where they are described as "internal, as bodily or mental distress; external, as injuries from men, animals, etc.; and superhuman, or inflictions by gods or demons" (Wilson, 1980: I, 200).
"evil deeds" (duşkarma, literally, “bad karma"). "The enjoyment of one's own self" (svātmānubhuti) is a reference to kaivalya ("perfect isolation, abstraction, de- tachment from all other connections, detachment of the soul from matter or further transmigrations..." M-W, 311). "surrender" (prapatti).
"By their own deeds, on the basis of their own knowledge, or out of devotion to You" is a reference to the three yogas of karma, jñāna, and bhakti. Even the worshippers of the Lord who approach Him by these three means are ultimately led by Him to His service (dāsyal kairkarya). Note, how- ever, that the devotees attain their position as servants of the Lord not because of their religious practices but because of His compassion (daya).

May Śri bestow welfare [on us].
Having beheld her face
and depending upon her expressions,
Hari creates, sustains, and dissolves all the worlds, and bestows heaven, hell and the Final Beatitude.
This amusing pastime would not be enjoyable but for the oneness of their delight.
O Goddess Śrī!

I long to praise You,
Mother of the entire world.
So make my speech suitable [for the task] and elevate my mind so as to be dominated by love.
Make my devotion auspicious
and gladden this servant
who has taken refuge with You.
O Lakṣmi,
let [people] like me become the target of the billows of Your sidelong glances
flowing forth.

What do poets declare
a [real] stotra to be?
If a stotra is a statement of non-existent qualities
found elsewhere,
[or qualities] belonging to another
and superimposed upon [the one to be praised], then what a waste would such words be
if directed to you!
On the other hand, if [poets] should say [that a stotra consists of]
a good, complete, all around description of real and existent qualities
then how can they speak [of you at all], when even Bṛhaspati himself
incapable of such speech
[drowns] in the ocean of your true qualities?
4
My words [describing Your qualities] --
which are well-known as being
beyond the grasp of speech and mind -- are spoken with a watering tongue.
But I do not regard
this [impossible attempt to praise you]
as ridiculous,
for after all, a thirsty partridge
does not hold back her tongue
and refuse to sip the moonlight,
just because she is unable to drink all of it!

O Goddess!
5
Although I am a lowly mortal,
evil-minded, lacking in love [for You] listless [in Your service, and] an ignoramus, I am neither afraid nor ashamed
to lick [the nectar of] Your glory,
[for such an act] would not be polluting.
If the River Gargā
is lapped by a dog
the dog is neither ashamed nor afraid;
rather, his thirst is
quenched.
6
Whether great or small,
the wealth of all people
is everywhere regarded as the outcome of Laksmi's benevolent glance.
This should not astonish us, because even Nārāyaṇa
Lord of the worlds
and the Ruler of Souls
Who has no lord over Him
thinks Himself fortunate
only on account of your glance!
Hey Goddess!
7
Whatever wealth exists among people,
whatever form of beauty and charm [are found]
in this world,
whatever is called good or auspicious is dependent on you.

Praise-Poem to [the Goddess] Śrī
Therefore, all these things enjoy excellence
173
either because they are identical with [the word] śri or because they are [best described]
by a word like śrimat.
O Goddesss!

Although omniscient
neither you nor even Hari
can comprehend the extent of your glory!
[How can this be?]
[Wise people] know that
one who vouches for the existence
of the non-existent sky-lotus
is called "deluded".
[Since Your glory has no limits],
ignorance of its extent
is ignorance of the non-existent
and is therefore compatible with your omniscience!
9
In this world [people] declare that
the difference between a tree and Bṛhaspati
results from the revered Bharati's grace.
But that very Bhārati
is Your servant.
I take refuge with Śri,
First Queen of the God of gods!

I take shelter with Śrī,

[When] she vowed [to cast]

arising from the absence of that glance shone forth instantly
like a tender and beautiful budding blossom.

NOTES
This verse clearly articulates the Śrīvaiṣṇava understanding of Śri's role in the creation of the worlds. For a full discus- sion of the Śrīvaiṣṇava view of Śrī, see Nayar 1992:221-56. The partridge (cakora/cakorī) is believed to subsist on moonbeams.
The notion that the glory of Śri cannot be completely com- prehended by Vişņu (just as He cannot fully comprehend His own glory) is based on Yamuna, Catuḥ Śloki, v. 2. "First Queen of the God of gods" (deva-deva-mahişīm) is an epithet of Sri contained in Ramanuja, ŚGad, para. 1.
