DEHALEESA STHUTHI STHUTHI
Swami DEsikan
INTRODUCTION
It is a great bhAgyam to write about the Divya Desam of ThirukkOvalUr and the three
Thiruvanthadhis of the mudal AzhwArs that have their origin at this divya desam.
SWAMI DESIKAN AND THIRUKKOVALUR
This is where Swami Desikan composed DehaLeesa Sthuthi, a sthOthram in praise of
Trivikraman, the presiding deity of this nadu naadu divya desam. He had stayed in the other
Nadu naadu divya desam (Thiruvaheendrapuram) for many years. On his way to Kanchipuram 
sadagopan.org
2
to have the darsanam of his beloved VaradarAjan, he visited ThirukkOvalUr.
He was moved by the symbolism of the Lord of this divya desam carrying SankhA and ChakrA
on the right and left hands respectively; normally Sriman NaarAyaNA carries Sudarsana
(ChakrathAzhwAr) on his right hand and His divine conch, Paanchajanyam, on His left hand. In
this sthalam, this traditional order is reversed.
Swami Desikan was inspired by the special symbolism indicated by Trivikraman
(UlagaLandhAn) at this divya desam and celebrated it by giving us his blessed work known as
Sri Saccharithra RakshA.
Sri DehaLeesa Sthuthi is a beautiful eulogy of Trivikraman and salutes the special experience of
the three "Mudal AzhwArs" at this divya desam. It has 28 slOkAs set in the Vasantha tilakA and
Maalini metres. The first 26 slOkams of this sthOthram are in Vasantha TilakA metre and the
last two are set in the Maalini metre.
DehaLi means a threshold. DehaLeesa means the Lord of DehaLi or the Lord of Threshold.
DehaLi in Tamil means the narrow portion of the house that connects the front door to the inner
chambers of the house. The names of DehaLi in Tamil are "rEzhi, idaikkazhi and Nadai". The
leelAs of the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr in the DehaLi of Mrugandu Maharishi's house resulted in
us being blessed with the "advent" of the three thiruvanthAdhis associated with the three mudal
azhwArs. Hence the exploits of Sri DehaLeesan are an appropriate subject for Swami Desikan's
eulogy and our adoration of his sthOthram.
I mentioned earlier that Saccharithra RakshA was composed by Swami Desikan at this divya
dEsam after the inspiring darsanam of Trivikraman (moolavar) with the divine conch on His
right hand and the Sudarsanam on His left hand. This composition deals with certain religious
practices of SrivaishNavAs.
In the first chapter of this work, Swami Desikan explained to us the significance of
samAsrayaNam (taptha mudra dhAraNam) or the wearing of the VishNu chinnams of Chakram
and sankham on the upper arms of SrivaishNavAs ;
The second chapter deals with the meaning of Urdhva Pundra DhAraNam (wearing of the 12
pundrams on one's upper torso).
The third chapter covers Bhagavath prapatthi and BhagavAn-niveditOpayOgA.
The grantham of Saccharithra RakshA explains the significance for SrivaishNavAs of following
the tradition of the above sacred rites with many quotations from scriptures. Some thirty years
ago, UttamUr SwamigaL has a written a 139 page commentary on this RakshAgrantham.
DIVYA DESAM AND ITS PARTICULARS
This kshethram is known as ThirukkOvalUr or ThirukkOilUr or Gopapuri. BhagavAn's
nAmadEyam is Trivikraman, AayAnAr, DehaLeesan and Gopanagareesan. ThAyAr's name is 
sadagopan.org
3
PoomkOval NaacchiyAr. The vimanam where Trivikraman stands facing east is known as
Srikara VimAnam. The theertham of this sthalam is KrishNa theertham and fits well with one of
the names of the Lord here (viz), AayanAr or Kovalan or the cowherd Lord. He is Prathyaksham
to mahA Bali chakravarthi, Mrigandu rishi and the three mudal AazhwArs, who sang about their
experience of having the darsana sowbhAgyam of the Lord and sang about it in three hundred
verses in the anthAdhi fashion. This type of composition poured out of AzhwArs, when they
had dhruva smrithi or uninterrupted meditation and enjoyment of the Lord. The three AzhwArs
stayed for many years at this divya desam and ascended to parama padham from here.
Besides the reversed sankha-chakram, this
kshEthram is known for uniqueness (viz), the
existence of a shrine for DurgA Devi within the
ardha mantapam of this temple. VishNu Durgai
is regularly worshipped here and protects the
kshEthram from inauspiciousness of all sorts.
There are 23 specific paasurams associated with
the three AzhwArs (viz), Poygai, Bhootham and
Thirumangai. Although all the 300 verses of the
three thiruvanthAdhis are about the
EmperumAn of ThirukkOvalUr, the following
specific ones add to the count of 23:
Poygai : Mudal ThiruvanthAdhi --77 & 86: (2)
BHootham: IrandAm ThiruvanthAdhi --70 (1)
Thirumangai:
Periya Thirumozhi -- 2.4.1, 5.6.7, 6.10.5, 7.3.2, 7.10.4 and the entire decad of 2.10 (15 in all)
ThirunedumthAndakam: 6, 7, 17 (3)
Siriya Thirumadal: 39 (1)
Periya Thirumadal: 60 (1)
Swami Desikan wove into his DehaLeesa sthuthi the rich meanings of the Paasurams of the four
AzhwArs.
THE ORIGIN OF THE THREE ANTHADHI PRABHANDHAMS AT THIRUKKOVALUR
Among the three Mudal AzhwArs, Poygai was the first to be born. He incarnated as the amsam
of Paanchajanyam in the month of Iyppasi and SravaNa nakshathram in a golden lotus in the
pushkaraNi of the temple of YathOkthakAri (ThiruvehkkA) at Kanchi. Since this AzhwAr
appeared on the lotus flower of a poygai (tank or pushkaraNi), he is revered as Poygai AzhwAr.
BhoothathAzhwAr incarnated next as the amsam of KowmEdhaki, the mace of the Lord in
Gopapuri 
sadagopan.org
4
Thirukkadalmallai divya desam (modern day MahA Balipuram) in a Kurukkatthi flower
(Maadhavi flower). His asterism is Avittam. He considered himself as one of the bhootham
(servant) of the Lord and hence was known as BhoothathAzhwAr.
PEy AzhwAr or the God-Intoxicated AzhwAr took his avathAram in Mylapore. He is the amsam
of the sword of the Lord (Nandakam). He incarnated on a red lily that blossomed inside the well
of the temple of Adhi Kesava PerumAL of Mylapore. He was born in Iypaasi Sathaya
Nakshathram. He declared his status as "pEyanAi ozhindEn yen pirAnukkE" (I have remained
as the intoxicated one of my Lord's anantha kalyANa guNAs) and hence was known as
pEyAzhwAr.
The three azhwArs were endowed with superlative qualities of Bhakthi and VairAgyam and
wandered over the land singing the praise of Sriman NArAyaNA. One day, The Lord wanted to
help the samsAris banish their false knowledge (aj~nAnam) and tApa trayams and for that
purpose brought His three wandering minstrels to the asramam of His parama bhakthan, Sage
MrugaNdu. The time was night and the season was that of monsoon. There was a torrential
downpour. The AzhwArs sought shelter at the small dehaLi of the sage's house. The space there
was just enough for one to lie down, two to sit and three to stand. Being three in number, the
azhwArs stood in a huddled manner. Suddenly, they felt the pressure from some one else
cramping them in their tight shelter. They did not see anyone enter thru the front door and did
not see anyone passing thru the dehaLi into the inner chamber of the house. They were intrigued
about the new arrival.
Poygai composed 100 verses that served to remove the external darkness (Mudal
ThiruvanthAdhi); Bhootham composed another one hundred verses in search of the one that
cramped them (second ThiruvanthAdhi) that removed the internal darkness; At the conclusion of
the two hundred verses sung by the first two aazhwArs, the third AzhwAr burst into song,
recording what he saw when the two kinds of darkness were dispelled. He declared that he has
seen now the fourth person, who crowded them and described Him as Sriman NaarAyaNA with
MahA Lakshmi on His chest and sankha-chakrams on His hands.
The God-realization of the three aazhwArs introduced a new and welcome era of worship of
Sriman NaarAyaNA. Since these incidents happened in a dehaLi and the Lord was instrumental
for these happenings, Swami Desikan gave Him the name of DehaLeesan. He also took the cue
from Thirumangai, who had saluted AayanAr of this KshEthram as “MathiL koval idai kazhi
aayan“ earlier. Swami Desikan went on to salute Lord DehaLeesan through 28 bhakthi-laden
slOkams that makes abundant references to the three anthAdhis of the Mudal AzhwArs.
Before we dwell deep into the Slokams of DehaLeesa Sthuthi, it is appropriate to focus on the
ancient salutations to this particular avathAram of our Lord in an exclusive fashion. This
avathAram is highly suggestive and symbolic from the view point of Sri VaishNavA doctrines
and this Vedic sanction and support accounts for the AzhwArs' unique anubhavam of this
avathAram. 
sadagopan.org

"Ongi UlahaLantha Uttaman PErpAdi" - SrI AndAL
ANDAL saluted Him as “Ongi UlahaLantha Uttaman“ in Her third Thiruppavai verse. GodhA
piratti refers to the all-pervasiveness of Sriman NaarAyaNA first here and then the esoteric chant
(vaachaka manthram), "Uttaman pEr“ next. Thirumangai on the other hand refers to the
Thirumanthiram first and then only the VyApthi (VishNu tattvam) of our Lord in his
Thirunedumthandakam (4.5). Both of them are celebrating the SarvOtthamathvam (uttaman) of 
sadagopan.org
6
VishNu-NaarAyaNan here.
NammAzhwAr invited the world to see the enfolding wonderment of the sacred feet of the Lord
shooting up and out to measure the earth and the sky
KaaNmingal ulaheer yenru kaNNmuhappE nimirntha TaaLiNayan uhappE nimirntha TaaLiNayan uhappE nimirntha TaaLiNayan
Our Lord's paadham and the Sri paadha theertham is the most sacred for us as salvation.
Thirumangai stood before ThiruvEnkatamudayAn and reflected on the adhbhutham of the Lord
measuring the entire world with His two steps :
Kondaai KuraLaai nilam yeeradiyAlE, VindOyi sikartthiruvEnkatam meya Kondaai KuraLaai nilam yeeradiyAlE, VindOyi sikartthiruvEnkatam meya Kondaai KuraLaai nilam yeeradiyAlE, VindOyi sikartthiruvEnkatam meya - -
At KaazhiccheerAma ViNNagaram, Thirumangai was filled with wonder about the Lord's power
to get the sky and the earth under two of His steps and shattering the ego of Maha Bali
oru KuraLaairunilam moovadi maNN vEndi, oru KuraLaairunilam moovadi maNN vEndi, oru KuraLaairunilam moovadi maNN vEndi,
ulahanaitthum eeradiyAl odukki ulahanaitthum eeradiyAl odukki ulahanaitthum eeradiyAl odukki
- - maavaliyai sirayil vaittha TADaLan thALaNaiveer maavaliyai sirayil vaittha TADaLan thALaNaiveer maavaliyai sirayil vaittha TADaLan thALaNaiveer
The choice of the word "aNaiveer" is so rich in rasam and reveals the compassion of AzhwAr in
his role as an AchAryA.
At ThiruarimEya ViNNagaram, Thirumangai is filled with astonishment over the deed that the
Lord accomplished at the yaga SaalA of MahA Bali. He describes this kshEthram as the site,
where the Lord came in the form of a dwarf and asked for three feet of earth as gift and then
grew immensely to measure the ocean-covered earth, the sky and the space in between
effortlessly
mihu siRu kuRaLaai moovadi yenru iranthittu, mihu siRu kuRaLaai moovadi yenru iranthittu, mihu siRu kuRaLaai moovadi yenru iranthittu,
anDamum ivvalaikkadalum avanigaLumellam aLantha pirAn amarum idam
At ThiruveLLiangudi divya desam, Thirumangai salutes this kshEthram as the one belonging to
the kapata vAmanan, who with His three steps filled the eight directions
TeLLIya KuraLaai moovadi kondu thikkuRa vaLarnthavan koil TeLLIya KuraLaai moovadi kondu thikkuRa vaLarnthavan koil
At ThiruvazhundUr, the peripatetic Thirumangai stops to wonder at the miracle of the Lord
transforming from the appearance as a dwarf to that of TrivikramA to measure the universes
with His three steps and saluted Him as his Lord (thalaivan) this way:
vaanavar tam thuyar theera vandhu thOnRi vaanavar tam thuyar theera vandhu thOnRi
maaNuruvaai moovadi maavaliyai vEndi , maaNuruvaai moovadi maavaliyai vEndi , maaNuruvaai moovadi maavaliyai vEndi ,

TheLLiya KuRaL
He was probably reminded by the “KaaNminkalulaheer” invitation of NammAzhwAr at
ThiruviNNagaram, when he concluded this verse with “kaaNmin “.
The AchAryAs followed the way shown by the AzhwArs. AaLavanthAr saluted Trivikrama in
the 31st verse of his SthOthra Rathnam and wondered as to when the lotus feet of the Lord of
Trivikraman with the signs of the divine chakram, conch, mace, flag, goad and other lAnchanAs
are going to decorate his head:
kathA puna: sanka rathAnga kalpaka kathA puna: sanka rathAnga kalpaka

Trivikrama tvaccharaNAmbhuja dvayam
madheeya murdhAnamalankarishyathi ? II madheeya murdhAnamalankarishyathi ? II
Sri NarAyaNa Bhattadhiri celebrated this fast growing rUpam of Trivikraman and the Lord's
wonderful metamorphosis this way: 
sadagopan.org
8
divyam rUpam tava cha tadhitham pasyathAm visvabhAjam
ucchairucchai avrudhat avadheekruthya visvAnDa bhAnDam
Sri Bhattadhiri experiences like Thirumangai and NammAzhwAr the scene that unfolded before
one and all (kaaNmingaL ulaheer) and describes it as:
VisvabhAjAm pasyathAm (before all that witnessed the scene)
tava divyam tadh idham rUpam (this short dwarf form of Yours)
visvabhAndam avadheekruthya ucchairucchai: avrudhaath (grew higher and higher and defined
the boundaries of BrahmAndam ).
Sriman K.C.VaradAchAri comments on the concept of the Vamana-TrivikramA that
overpowered the imagination of the AzhwArs this way: “The VamanA became the TrivikramA.
KaTopanishad says that VamanA is the Godhead secret in the heart of man, and VishNu as the
Omni-pervading Being outside as the TrivikramA. The identity between the minutest
(aNOraNeeyAn) and the vastest (mahathOrmaheeyAn) is the supreme identity that is shown to
be the doctrine of VisishtAdvaithic interpretation of the vEda MahA Vakyams,
“Aham BrahmAsmi" , or "So'ham asmi" or "Tath tvamasi" .
This myth is very important for understanding the Real existence of the Omni pervading deity.
This myth is found in the Veda itself.
DayAnandha Saraswathi, the reputed commentator of VedAs lends support to this view, when
he interprets the name "VishNu” as "yO vEvEshti sa Jagadheesvara: " - - The Lord who is allpervading is VishNu.
Let us now look at the original rks of ancient Rg vedam, where TrivikramAvathAram alone is
saluted among all the avathArAs of Sriman VishNu-NaarAyaNan. They are found in the first
and sixth cantos of Rg vedam (1.22.17-21, 1.154.1, 1.155.4, and 6.49.13). These manthrams are
mystical and moving and formed the basis of the adoration of Trivikraman by the AzhwArs and
AchAryAs.
Rg Rk 1.22.17 is the celebrated rk that we invoke in our worship of the Lord:
idam VishnurvichakramE trEdhA ni dhadhE padham I idam VishnurvichakramE trEdhA ni dhadhE padham I
samULahamasya paamsurE II samULahamasya paamsurE II
MEANING :
The omnipresent and the omnipotent Lord dominates over ALL the three regions - - earth, mid
region and the sky - - and His one step is rooted in the deep dark mystery, beyond the ken of
mankind .
Rks 1.22.20& 21 are equally famous and are used by us in our daily aaradhanams: 
sadagopan.org

MEANING:
The emancipated ones (wise and true seekers) realize and experience the Lord through
meditation within their own selves. They recognize (see) Him vividly as the eye ranges
(recognizes) the yonder sky.
Through transcendental meditation and dharmic (pious) acts, the persevering (vigilant) seeker of
truth realizes (experiences) the all-pervading God within the innermost cavity (of his heart), the
supreme abode of the Lord.
Rk 1.154.2:

bhuvanAni visvA II bhuvanAni visvA II
The “Visva” sabdham and “Thrishu VikramaNEshu” picture are linked here. Sri MadhvAchArya
once gave 100 interpretations to that first naamam of Sri VishNu sahasra Naamam. This
manthram is therefore very profound to understand the Trivikrama avathAram of VishNuNaarAyaNan. The meaning of this Rk is as follows:
The omnipresent, all-pervading Lord has been dominating the world by His prowess like a
sturdy wild mountain lion dominates the forests. Within His three extended paces (strides), He
encompasses (covers) the entire creation (of His).
Rk 1.155.4& 5 salutes again the three consecutive steps of the Lord so that the world may live in
peace and states that no one comprehends the mystery of the third step.
Rg Rk 6.49.13.

MEANING:
O All-pervading Lord! May we be happy in a home filled with riches, progeny and relatives
bestowed on us by you. You measure out all the universes in three strides and guard mankind
from the inauspiciousness of the dark forces. 
sadagopan.org

All pervading Lord of ThirukkOvilUr 
sadagopan.org

Dayanandha Saraswathi interprets here the name of VishNu-Trivikraman as the one, who
measured the universes with three steps to protect the people in peril and to ward off the dangers
from such a peril.
This is the Vedic mystery that inspired the AzhwArs and AchAryAs to seek Trivikraman as their
ever-supportive, never-failing saviour (aapath bhAndhavan and AnAtha rakshakan who came to
the rescue when His devotees like Gajendran, Drowpathi and PrahlAdhA cried out for Him in
their hours of crisis).
adiyEn must now mention three items as a prelude to the actual coverage of DEhaLeesa sthuthi.
These are:
(1) Srimadh Bhagavatham's coverage of vAmanaa/Trivikrama avathAram (8th Canto) that
inspired Swami Desikan
(2) His own reference to this meaningful avathAram in the 8th verse of MummaNikkOvai and
(3) Sri NaarAyaNa Bhattadhiri's anubhavam of Sri GuruvAyurappan as Vaamana-Trivikraman in
his Sri NaarayaNeeyam's 30th and 31st sargams.
BHAGAVATHAM 'S COVERAGE
When amrutham was obtained as a result of the Lord's assistance as KUrma mUrthy, Indra and
the DevAs got the upper hand in their battle with the asurAs and the kings of the asurA clan like
MahA Bali were killed. The guru of asurAs, SukrAchAryA with his power of penance brought
back to life, MahA Bali and his retinue through the performance of a MahA Yajnam known as
Visvajith.
MahA Bali and his associates got restored to their lives and went after IndrA and the DevAs and
drove IndrA from his kingdom. The mother of IndrA, Athithi Devi appealed to her lord, Kasyapa
PrajApathi and asked him for guidance on redressing the sufferings of their son, IndrA.
Kasyapa PrajApathi advised his wife that the performance of the PayOvratha hOmam consisting
of the aahuthi of rice cooked in milk would please Sriman NaarAyaNA would lead to the birth of
a son, who would help IndrA regain his kingdom. Athithi Devi performed with austerity the
recommended hOmam and had the good fortune of having Sriman NaarAyaNA Himself as her
son (Vaamana MUrthy). She appealed to her new-born dwarf-statured son to help His brother,
IndrA and restore his kingdom.
MahA Bali was restored to life not only because of the manthra balam of SukrAchAryA, but also
because of the vow given by the Lord during NarasimhAvathAram to PrahlAdhan that He will
not kill any of his descendants. MahA Bali was the grandson of PrahlAdhA. Hence, Sriman
NaarAyaNA brought him back to life to enact his avathAra kaaryam as Vaamana-TrivikramA.
Sriman NaarAyaNA responded to the austere performance of PayOvratham by the Deva MaathA.
She had prayed to Him at the end of observance this way and the Lord responded as He does to
the sincere prayers of His bhaktha SikhAmaNis:

MEANING:
O Lord of the Yaj~nAs! O Yaj~na rUpi! O Achyutha, who does not let down any one, who sought
your refuge! O Lord, who has the Ganga theertham flow from your sacred feet! O BhagavAn,
who quenches the thirst of the SaraNAgathAs! O Primeval Lord (Aadhi PurushA)! Please bless
us with auspiciousness. Are not you indeed the one who comes to the rescue of the meek and
downtrodden (dheenAs)?
The Lord entered the Veeryam of Kaasyapa PrajApathi in response to the prayers of Athithi. Our
sAsthrAs state that the Jeevan stays in the Purusha Garbham for two months and then enters the
wife's garbham through garbhA dhAnam and stays there for ten months before coming out as a
child.
The Lord appeared as a son of Athithi after 12 months and incarnated on the day when SravaNa
nakshathram and Dwadasi thithi were in unison. He appeared with sankham and chakram in the
Prakata (shining, illustrious) VaishNava RUpam (in the divya rUpam as VishNu):
prAsUtha cha prakata VaishNava divya rUpam
saa dvAdasi srAvaNa puNyadinE bhavantham
 --- Sri NaarAyaNeeyam : 30.4 Sri NaarAyaNeeyam : 30.4
In the asramam of Kasyapa and Athithi, the Lord was born with
VishNu chihnams and the blessed parents eulogized the Lord
and AT THAT MOMENT, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf
brahmachAri:
BhadvAnjaleem Jaya JayEthi nutha: pithrubhyAm
tvam Tath KshaNE patutamam vaturUpamAdhA : tvam Tath KshaNE patutamam vaturUpamAdhA : tvam Tath KshaNE patutamam vaturUpamAdhA :
--Sri NaarAyaNeeyam: 30.5 Sri NaarAyaNeeyam: 30.5
MEANING:
At that instant, when the parents were saluting the Lord with
folded hands, He transformed Himself into a brisk BrahamchAri
rUpam.
The great sage, Kasyapa performed Upanayanam for his “brahmachAri " son. The boy's mother,
BrahmA, Sarasvathi, Saptha Rishis and KubEran presented Him with the insignias of
Brahmacharyam such as Munji belt made out of dharbha grass, PalAsa dhandam, deer skin
VaishNava DivyarUpam 
sadagopan.org
13
(KrishNAjinam), KankaNam, loin cloth, Kamandalu, umbrella and bikshApaathram. The Lord is
never without His consort, MahA Lakshmi. He had her as always on His chest and here in this
brahmachAri rUpam, he had her covered under the deer skin.
The Lord shone with these symbols associated with the celibate status and was ready for
UpAkarmA/VedhArambham. Surya BhagavAn blessed the Lord with Gayathri Manthra
UpadEsam, since he is the athishTaana daivam for Gayathri manthram. He replaced the father's
usual role here. The Deva Guru, Bruhaspathi had presented earlier the Lord with
YajnOpaveetham. Kasyapa PrajApathi tied the munji belt around the waist of the Lord, his son.
This munji belt according to AtharvaNa vedam banishes the rOgam associated with the bladder
for BrahmachAris.
BhUmi Devi presented Her Lord with KrishNAjinam to confer long life. The wearing of the deer
skin on the celibate's body wards off Kshaya rOgam (tuberculosis) as well. Chandran presented
the Lord with palAsa dhandham (samith). BrahmachAris carry palAsa dhandham to protect their
memory of the VedhAdhyananam. PalAsam is the name of Purasa tree, which has the three
branched growth in reverence to the TripAdha Gayathri that the DevAs meditated upon under it.
BrahmachAris performing VedAdhyayanam have to rush to their Guru’s side for performing
service at all times including the mid day, when the sun is at its apex. Hence, an umbrella is
useful to them. When the heat from the sun affects the delicate circulation of the thin region of
the skin covering the ears, the circulation to the brain is affected and hence, BrahmachAris have
to protect themselves against the sun.
Veda Viths must always have water for achamanam and prOkshaNam. Hence Kamandalu is
carried by the ones exposed to the VedhAs. Brahma DevA gave the kamandalu to the Lord
anticipating the use of his own kamandalu theertham to serve as Paadhyam for the Lord's feet as
it shot up towards his own home, SatyalOkam.
The BikshApAthram was given to the Lord by KubhEran, the Lord of wealth. UmA Devi as Anna
pUrNi gave the first Bikshai. Normally, the BrahmachAri asks his mother or sister after
Upanayanam for Bikshai (Bhavathi BikshAm DEhi). The reason is that the BrahmachAri does not
want to encounter a negative response for his first Bikshai. Srimadh Bhagavatham says in this
context:
“BikshAm Bhagavathee SaakshAth UmAdhAdhambikhA sathee” “BikshAm Bhagavathee SaakshAth UmAdhAdhambikhA sathee”
Brahmin's wealth is his penance. Brahma sUthram (pUNal) protects that accumulated Tapas.
Hence Brahaspathi BhagavAn appeared in person and presented the pUNal to the Lord.
Surya BhagavAn initiated the Vaamanan with Gayathri manthram for Loka kshEmam. Gayathri
is recited according to Bhishma for the preservation of auspiciousness in the world and to avoid
akAla mrithyu (Na tathra mriyathE bAla: Gayathri yathra japyathE).
The Lord equipped with all the insignias of a celibate who has performed His upAkarmA
walked towards the Yaaga SaalA of MahA Bali:

MEANING:
Hari NaarAyaNan traveled thus towards the yAgasAlA of the AsurA king wearing the kusA rope
belt, carrying the umbrella, kamandalu, palAsa dhandham and hiding His extraordinary power
and the gigantic form that he was going to take soon.
BhAgavatham says in the next slOkam that
the Bhumi bent under the weight of this
Kapata Vaamana rUpi.
The Yaaga SaalA was on the banks of
NarmadhA River. SukrAchArya and the
assembled ruthvikhs were dazzled by the
tEjas of the dwarf that presented himself
there. He came there not so much to punish
MahA Bali for his trespasses, but to bless
him as the grandson of His devout BhakthA,
PrahlAdhA. MahA Bali stopped his Yajnam
and greeted the Brahmin dwarf full of
Vedha Sampath. He washed the feet of the
Vaamana mUrthy and placed that water on
his head out of respect.
Srimadh Bhagavatham describes MahA
Bali's happiness over the arrival of
Vaamanan at his Yajnam:
adhya na: pithara: trupthA : adhya na: Paavitham kulam I adhya na: pithara: trupthA : adhya na: Paavitham kulam I
adhya: svishta: krathurayam yadh bavAn aagathO gruhAn II adhya: svishta: krathurayam yadh bavAn aagathO gruhAn II
---Srimadh Bhagavatham 8.18.30 Srimadh Bhagavatham 8.18.30
MEANING :
Today, my pithrUs (ancestors) are very pleased (fulfilled); my vamsam is sanctified by your
arrival ; my yajnam is fructified .
Then, he goes on to say that he is freed of all sins by placing the paadhOdhakam from the
Bali washed the feet of VaamanamUrthi 
sadagopan.org
15
Vedavith and the whole yaaga saalA has become purified. MahA Bali then asks the vaamana
mUrthy to choose a gift. The kapata Vaamanan asks for three feet of land. MahA Bali is
offended by this modest request. He goads the Vaamanan to ask for some thing more fitting his
rank as an emperor. The kapata Vaamanan insists on just three feet of land (BhUmim paadha
traya parimithAm prArthayAmAseetha tvam). SukrAchArya begins to understand the intent of
the Kapata Vaamanan and warns his sishyan against giving such a dhAnam requested by the
dwarf, whom he recognizes as none other than Hari NaarAyaNan. MahA Bali refuses to go back
on his word and deeds the gift requested. He pours the water on the hands of the Dwarf
BrahmachAri and AT THAT INSTANT, the Lord transformed from the Vaamana to Trivikrama
rUpam and shot up skyward and measured both the sky and the entire earth with His two steps.
The Lord then asked MahA Bali as to where He should place His third step. The AsurA king
begged the Lord to place His third step on his head and the Lord obliged. Out of His affection for
the grandson of PrahlAdhA, the Lord created a lOkam known as Suthalam and settled MahA
bali there with his family and retinue and protected the asurA king there by being as his
rakshakan.
SWAMI DESIKAN'S CELEBRATION OF TRIVIKRAMAVATHARAM
In the eighth verse of MummaNikkOvai, our AchAryA salutes the Trivikraman this way:
aaraNangaL thEda vayindhainagar vandhuthittha aaraNangaL thEda vayindhainagar vandhuthittha
kAraNanAi ninra kadalvaNNan kAraNanAi ninra kadalvaNNan kAraNanAi ninra kadalvaNNan --nAraNanAr nAraNanAr
ippatikku mikkanreduttha paadhankazhuva ippatikku mikkanreduttha paadhankazhuva
meypadikka maanathu pon verpu
MEANING:
The Lord, who is being sought by the VedAs appeared and settled at Thiruvaheendrapuram as
DevanAthA and illumines this kshEthram as the primeval cause of this world (Jagath kaaraNa
bhoothan). This Lord having the hue of the bluish ocean excelled once before as Trivikraman,
who measured with two steps the earth and the sky and had His son, BrahmA wash His sacred
feet with the Kamandalu theertham, which was received by the golden mountain, MEru serving
as a receptacle (receiving/storing vessel).
Sriman NArAyaNan is sakalEthara VilakshaNan (i-e), He is matchless (tann OppAr Illappan). He
is the one that nothing can match or exceed with regard to His kalyANa GuNAs (viz);
Sowlabhyam (ready accessibility to His devotees),
Sowseelyam (free and easy communion with His devotees),
Sarva jana rakshathvam,
Infinite Daya (grace and compassion) that confers on the Mumukshus (seekers of Moksham) the 
sadagopan.org
16
status of apahathapApmathvam (the pristine state of complete freedom from all sins attained by
the prapannA due to His DayA).
When the three AzhwArs (divya sUris) were squeezed in the dehaLi of Mrugandu Muni's
aasramam, in a spirit of eika kantyam (unified thought with out dissonance), they poured out
their hearts to their sarva swAmi in three hundred moving verses, which are testaments to their
svAbhAvika (natural, innate) Parabhakthi, ParajnAnam and ParamajnAnam.
Let us focus on the above three important concepts. The first of the three Mudal AzhwArs
(Poygai) inferred (intuited) Sriman NaarAyaNA's existence (being) through his transcendent
knowledge (parajnAnam). Through this effort, he removes the outer darkness as it were.
The second AzhwAr (BhUthathAr) "through maturing gnosis" transforming into devotion
experienced Sriman NaarAyaNA at the dehaLi. This is the fruit of his parabhakthi. He drove
away the inner darkness this way.
The third Divya sUri (PEy) through his intuitive union of knowledge and devotion (parama
Jn~AnA) had the divya chakshus (divine vision) for all the three of them to see the auspicious
subhAsrayam (thirumEni) of the Lord with MahA Lakshmi and the Lord's disc and conch at the
small space of the dehaLi. This is “the mayarvara mathi nalam“ referred to by NammAzhwAr.
Bhakthi and Jn~Anam mingle and become BhakthirupApanna Jn~Anam. At this stage, Jn~Anam
ripens and transforms to parabhakthi. They are not easily separable according to AchArya
RamAnujA. He states “Semushi BhakthirUpA". With the blessings of their svAbhAvika
parajn~AnA, Parabhakthi and paramajn~AnA, the three AzhwArs had the sAkshAthkAram
(direct vision) of the Lord and His consort on that dark, rainy night at Gopapuri.
Swami Desikan reflects on the blessings conferred on the three AzhwArs by Sriman
NaarAyaNA's dayA and aasritha vaathsalyam and longs for a similar blessing. He pours out his
heart in 28 brilliant slokAs housing great Sri VaishNavA doctrines that echo the thoughts
enshrined in the three hundred celebratory verses of the three ThiruvandhAthis dealing with the
three rahasyams.
He suggests that the three doctrines (concepts) - - tattva, hitha and purushArtham-- are derived
from the three ThiruvandhAthis. Our AchAryAs have revealed to us that "the paramount
thatvam or Parama Thatvam" is none other than "Sriman NaarAyaNA", the antharyAmi of all the
chEthanAs and the achEthanAs. The AchAryAs have reiterated that our paramahitham, "the only
means to gain our Lord's grace is SaraNAgathi". They have untiringly revealed to us in one voice
that the parama-purushArtham is nithya kaimkaryam to His bhAgavathAs on this earth and
eternal service to Him in parama padham.
Swami Desikan was essentially reflecting on these eternal truths, when he stood before the
Moola VirAt of Trivikrama at thirukkOvalUr and thought about the special drama that the Lord
played in this divya desam to confer His blessings on the three Mudal AzhwArs and begged for a
similar blessing from the Lord. Thus arose the twenty eight moving verses of the DEhaLIsa
Sthuthi. 
sadagopan.org
17
SwAmi DEsikan recollecting Trivikraman's drama
In my efforts to cover the meaning of these great sthuthis, I am guided by the commentaries of
my Maanaseeka AachAryA, Sri V.N. Srirama DesikAchAr Swamy of my native place, a great Sri
Swami Desika BhakthA; Sri Dindukkal Ramaswamy AyyangAr and Abhinava Desika Sri
UttamUr VeerarAghavAchArya Swami. May Swami Desikan bless these paltry efforts attempted
in a spirit of sharing my limited understanding of this vast and complex subject.
The first verse of this Sthuthi consists of Swami
Desikan's prayerful appeal to the presiding deity of
ThirukkOvalUr (ThirukkOilUr) for his rakshaNam
(protection). Swami salutes the Lord, who measured the
universes and the space beyond in His two strides.
Swami recollects that during His incarnation as the
dwarf brahmachAri, the Lord asked for three steps of
land as a gift and then expanded and measured the
earth and space and made them His own. The
Maharishis, emperor MahA Bali, the dEvAs, BrahmA,
SivA and all those who witnessed the miracle of the
Lord's spreading feet sweeping the expanses saluted
Him as the prime cause behind the existence and
functioning and the dissolution of the universe .
The Third Step 
sadagopan.org
18
Our AchAryA points out to us that the Lord of such glory and power presides over this divya
desam and blesses every one with parama purushArhtam and prays to Him to extend His net of
protection to him as well.

Sri D.Ramaswamy Iyengar"s translation brings beautifully the meaning of this verse. I will
quote his translation for the verse and add my comments.
"May that Supreme Ruler (King) of Gopapuri (KovalUr) by whom the worlds were (stepped
over) measured and conquered, who is regarded as the ultimate cause of the Universe, who
bestows the various kinds of PurushArthAs on His devotees, May He be my protector!".
COMMENTS
In this slOkam set in the third person, Swami Desikan has three major themes in mind to salute
the greatness of the Lord of Gopapuri:
b the first is "Yena bhoomnA jaganthi vijithAni";
b the second is "Yam viswasya parama kAraNam aamananthi" and

b the third is "(Ya :) praNayinAm vividhAn pumarthAn visrANayan "
1 .YENA BHOOMNAA JAGANTHI VIKRAMYA VIJITHAANI 1 .YENA BHOOMNAA JAGANTHI VIKRAMYA VIJITHAANI
Appropriately enough, Swami Desikan starts with the word "Vikramya" to remind us of the
VikramaNam (stride) of the Trivikraman of this divya desam.
The Lord incarnated as VaamanA on the SravaNa DvAdasi day
in the aasramam of Sage Kasyapa and his wife Athithi. Sri NaarAyaNeeyam salutes the birth of
the Lord as VaamanA in the 30th dasakam:
prAsUtha cha PRAKATA VAISHNAVA DIVYA RUPAM
Saa DVAADASEE SRAVANA PUNYADINEH NYADINEH NYADINEH BHAVANTHAM
The moment he was born with sankham and chakram, he hid His avathAra rahasyam and
assumed the form of a brisk, dwarf brahmachAri (patutamam vaturUpamAdhA:). Thereafter, the
brisk brahmachAri proceeded to the site of Maha Bali's yajn~am. Under the mighty steps of this
BrahmachAri, the earth bent (BhaarENa ghAm sannamayanpadhE padhE) according to Srimadh
Bhagavatham. The appearance of this extraordinary celebrant at the Yajn~am is further described
by Srimadh Bhagavatham through the following verse:
chathram sadhandam kamandalum
vivEsa vibhradhdhayamEgavAtam I vivEsa vibhradhdhayamEgavAtam I
mounchyA mEkalayA veetham upaveethAjinOttharam mounchyA mEkalayA veetham upaveethAjinOttharam mounchyA mEkalayA veetham upaveethAjinOttharam
jatilam Vaamanam vipram maaNavakam HARIM II jatilam Vaamanam vipram maaNavakam HARIM II
This Hari NaarAyaNan dressed in the garb of a BrahmachAri asking for Bikshai with his
dhandam, umbrella, kamandalu, munji belt, and jatai, upaveetham with the krishNajinam to
hide the presence of inseparable MahA Lakshmi on His chest arrived and begged for three feet
of land (bhUmim pAdha traya parimithAm praarthayAmi). In spite of the protestation of his
AchArya, MahA Bali granted the wish and poured water in the extended hands of the Kapata
Vaaman to solemnize the deed. What happened next is beautifully described by Sri NaarAyaNa
Bhattadhiri:
divyam rUpam tava cha tadhitham pasyathAm visvabhAjAmucchairucchairavrudhatheekruthya VISVAANDA BHAANDAM
The little figure of Vaamana mUrthy set the brahmAndam as its border and grew on and on
instantaneously. One foot covered the earth and measured it; the other foot stepped up and
measured the aakasam and beyond.
This VIKRAMANAM of the Trivikraman celebrated by the Sri VishNu sahasra Naamam
passage, "IsvarO vikrami dhanvI mEdhAvi vikrama krama:“ becomes the immediate object of
attention of Swami Desikan and becomes the first word of the first verse of this Sthuthi
(Vikramya). 
sadagopan.org
23
That He conquered and reclaimed the Universe that is always His is referred to in the subsequent
words: “Vikramya yEna vijithAni Jaganthi“ (By whom the universe was pervaded, measured and
conquered).
What was the power behind such a conquest? What was the vidhyA used to achieve this
superlative deed asks Swami Desikan next and answers with one word, which forms the final
word of the first paadham of this first slOkam of dEhaleesa Sthuthi. That word is BHOOMNAA.
This word has profound upanishadic significance and is very dear to Achaarya RaamAnujA and
occurs in ChandhOgya Upanishad as BhoomaadhikaraNa vidhyA. We will cover the significance
of this word pregnant with meaning to understand Swami Desikan's meticulous choice of this
word to salute the Anantha kalyANa guNaas of dEhaLIsA of ThirukkOvalUr.
The holiest of holy days for Sri VaishNavAs is SRAVANA DVAADASI. The day when fasting
gives the fruit of fasting on 10,000 EkAdasi days. SravaNa DvAdasi day is also the day on which
Sriman NaarAyaNA incarnated as Vaamana Murthy to bless MahA Bali, the grand son of
PrahlAdA.
THE PROFOUND CONCEPT OF BHUMAN.
The word Swami Desikan chose in the first line of the
first slOkam was “BhumnA” derived from Bhuman
meaning plenty, abundance, great quantity and Infinity.
Swami Desikan salutes the glory or mahimA of
Trivikraman with the statement: “Yena bhumnaa
jaganthi vikramya vijithAni". Sri RamAnujA's
commentary in Sri Bhashyam is very appropriate to
understand the significance of the term “BhUmnA“
chosen by Swami Desikan to celebrate the infinite glory
of the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr.
The context of the BhumAdhikAram in the seventh
chapter of ChandhOgya Upanishad is relevant to cover as
preface on BhUmA and BhUmnA. Once NaradA
approached SanatkumArA and lamented about his lack
of knowledge of Atman inspite of his mastery over
manthrAs.
The compassionate SanathkumArA instructed NaradA about BhUma VidyA and defined
BhUman as the infinite, the immense. He said that BhUman as the infinite is sukhA and sukhA
itself is identified with Satya. Earlier ChandhOgya Upanishad had defined Brahman as Kham or
infinite joy (parama Sukham). Taittiriya Upanishad has also defined Brahman as Aanandam or
bliss absolute. Sage SanatkumArA offered the following definition for BhUman:
" Yathra nAnyath pasyathi, nAnyath sriNOthi, nAnyath Vij~nAthi, sa BhUmA ; atha i, nAnyath Vij~nAthi, sa BhUmA ; atha i, nAnyath Vij~nAthi, sa BhUmA ; atha
yathra anyath pasyathi, anyath sriNOthi, anyath vij~nAthi tadh alpam " yathra anyath pasyathi, anyath sriNOthi, anyath vij~nAthi tadh alpam "
BhUmAn 
sadagopan.org
24
Where one does not see another, hear another, and does not know another, that one is BhUman ;
where one does see another, hear another, and know another, that is trivial. Sri RamAnujA
explains "where" as "that in the experience of which".
It has been pointed out that the nature of joy that flows from BhUman is limitless and infinite.
Therefore, any one, who is in communion with Brahman by the way of comprehension, does not
experience any sorrow, since Brahman is infinitely blissful by svabhAvam .
Sage SanathkumArA answers next the question of his pupil, NaradA on what the BhUman is
established in. The teacher answers that it is established in ITS own glory or mahimA (SVE
MAHIMNI). This is a case of SELF-DEPENDENCE. The sage hastens to correct any impression
that BhUman is deriving anything from its glories. Sudarsana Suri, who wrote Srutha PrakAsikA
(Acharya RaamAnujA's Bhashyam from his kalakshEpam under his feet) points out in the
context that “there is no denial of glory. But, there is a denial of His being established in the
glory of the form of Lordship (Iswarathvam) over all things derived and controlled.
Professor SampathkumAran has added his thoughts on the BhUman this way: “God’s glories are
gifts and not investments. The creative self-manifestation of God is for imparting life out of His
own abundance (bhUman) and not for rectification of His deficiencies. As this urge for selfimpartation is an eternal attribute, He manifests Himself through eternity. He is the
paramAthamn (supreme aathman) described as the Bhuman of this nature and is all pervading as
Trivikrama VishNu. In this sense, he fits the description of ChandhOgya Upanishad, “Sa eva
idham sarvam". This statement goes beyond the earlier statement of Saandilya VidhyA of the
very same upanishad, which declared, “Sarvam kalu idham BrahmA".
This paramAthman described as the BhUman of this nature is the transcendent absolute, which
in its immanence of creative involvement with the world of finites is recognized as an irreducible
fact (AthmathA eva idam sarvam--Ch.U VII .26.1). “Only from the Supreme Self does everything
come into being. He who knows this goes beyond all afflictions and achieves all-sided (full)
perfection" -- (Ch.U VII .26.2). Such is the comprehension and perfection that Swami Desikan
was seeking, when he stood in front of GopapurIsan and stated "Yena BhUmnA Jaganthi
vikramya vijithAni".
2. VISVASYA YAM PARAMA KAARANAM AAMANNTHI 2. VISVASYA YAM PARAMA KAARANAM AAMANNTHI
This is the second paadham of the first slOkam. Based on the above lengthy interpretation of the
word “BhUMnA”, Swami Desikan's reference to the Lord as the first and fundamental cause
(parama KaaraNam) of this manifested world becomes transparent.
The references here are to "TadhanyathvamArambhaNasabdhAdhibhya:" - - Brahma sUtram
II.1.14 and a slokam in Srimadh Bhagavatham, which reveals : "At the end of the kalpA , the selfluminous Lord manifested (abhivyanak) this world , which was covered with blinding darkness
wrought by Time, through His self-luminous power (chithsakthi)". Thus He, the Jagadhprathama mangaLam becomes the parama-kAraNam of this viswam. That is what the
Upanishads and VedAs sing about. Swami Desikan reminds us of this fundamental fact, while 
sadagopan.org
25
seeking the protection of his Creator.
3. VISRAANAYAN PRANAYINAAM PUMARTHAAN
This is the third paadham of the first slOkam that declares "He is the giver of many boons and
blessings (PurushArthams) to His devotees (praNayinAM). He is the veritable VaradarAjan
residing at Gopapuri".
4. GOPTHAA SA ME BHAVATHU GOPAPURAADHIRAAJA: 4. GOPTHAA SA ME BHAVATHU GOPAPURAADHIRAAJA: 4. GOPTHAA SA ME BHAVATHU GOPAPURAADHIRAAJA:
In this fourth paadham of the first slOkam, Swami Desikan prays to the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr
and requests the boon of Him becoming his protector (gOpthA).

MEANING:
The second slokam set in a confessional tone begins to address the Lord in second person
directly.
"O Supreme Lord of the dEhaLi! The immensity of your superiority (Lordship) makes one
attempting to eulogize you, dumb-struck and tongue-tied and makes them choke in their efforts.
Their voice thickens, the tears swell in their eyes. Overpowered by the thought of your
grandness, they are unable to continue with their intention to sing your praise. Yet, the very same
matchless Iswarathvam of Yours instead of keeping me as one of the silent majority makes me
garrulous in my efforts to praise you. The very same Iswarathvam of yours displayed in the small
space of a dEhaLi on that unforgettable night, when You permitted Yourself to be crushed by
those three pre-eminent poets known for their total conquest of their senses (IndriyAs)."
COMMENTS
In the second slokam of Sri DehaLIsa sthuthi, Swami Desikan reveals the reason for his boldness
to eulogize the supreme Lord. He states that he was tongue-tied and awe-struck at the thought of
the Lord's matchless act of measuring the earth and the space with two of His strides and how at
the same time He is readily accessible to His devotees. Then, Swami Desikan says that he
slOkam 2 
sadagopan.org
27
reflected upon the simplicity of the act of the Lord letting Himself crushed in the tight space of a
dEhaLi and that thought made his tongue loosen and let him become almost "garrulous in His
praise".
The key words in this slOkam are:
kvachana KshapAyAm (on that one unforgettable night)
vimarthanEna (being pressed),
dhAntha: (those who had achieved full control of their IndriyAs) and
kavi mukhyA: (pre-eminent poets in Tamil/inn paadum kavigal according to NammAzhwAr and
pAttukkuriya pazhayavar moovar according to Swami Desikan).
Swami Desikan explains here as to what emboldened him to approach the Supreme Lord of
ThirukkOvalUr and venture to sing about His anantha kalyANa guNAs. He says that the very
same supremacy (Iswarathvam), which made others self-conscious liberated him and his tongue.
Swami states that the very thought of the Sowlabhyam of the Lord, which made Him mingle
with His three dear devotees in a dEhaLi removed the inhibitions that he might have had like
others engaged in a similar effort. The Lord, Who is VachamAgocharam (beyond words) and
aprApya manasA sa: (unapproachable even by the mind) became accessible to Swami Desikan as
a result of his reflections on His sowlabhyam.
According to Sri D.Ramaswamy ayangaar, Swami Desikan has explained his reasons for
venturing the unapproachable SarvEsvaran and His consort to eulogize them. In Sri VaradarAja
panchakam, it was the Lord's affection (vaathsalyam) that made him bold (vAthsalyamEva
mukharIkarOthi). In GodhA sthuthi, the auspicious guNAs of ANDAL makes him pour out his
heart (Mowna dhruhO mukharayanthi guNAs tvadhIyA :). Here in the case of dEhaLIsa sthuthi,
it is the supremacy (Iswarathvam) that unleashes his tongue.
The Lord of the dEhaLi

"O Lord of GopapurA! The wheel of Time spins as
fast as the ChakrAyutham (Sudarsanam) adorning
your hand. The hundreds of edges of your chakram
change their positions to up and down with time as it
rotates fast. Similarly, the creators (BrahmAs) and the
lord of dEvAs (IndrAs) and asurAs (MahA Bali et al)
change from their superior to lower positions with the
spinning of the wheel of Time. They fully understand
that their rank and power are thus not permanent and
hence arrive at your sannidhi in ThirukkOvalUr,
perform aarAdhanam for you, rid themselves of the
bonds of karma this way and attain mOksham
through engagement in Bhakthi or Prapatthi. Some
attain residency in svarga lOkam through their
worship of you. Thus, the SurAs and AsurAs worship
you, who appeared here out of your own infinite
mercy and attain the objects of their desire through
your anugraham."

In this penance-grove (TapOvanam) of sage MruganDu situated on the bank of the river PaNNA
(PeNNai aaru), You stand like the green TamAla tree (nettilinga pacchilai maram) with its tall
branches resembling your bounteous, long and lovely hands, its flowers like Your beautiful
ornaments adorning You. This tree has at its lower portions (feet of the Lord) the ripe and
nourishing fruits (boons of the Lord) and protects the world and its beings under it through its
luminous shade (rakshakathvam) of the Lord. You bathe the eyes of your devotees with
parmAnandham, while you stand on the banks of PaNNA River like a TamAla tree in the
penance-grove of Sage MruganDu.
COMMENTS
Here Swami Desikan compares the Lord to a tall, ever green TamAla tree. The attributes of the
Lord found in the TamAla tree are:
b its long branches reminding Swami of the long and lovely arms of the Lord praised by
Thirumangai as "nedum taDakkai“,
slOkam 4 
sadagopan.org
30
b Yielding of its fruits not on the top branches, but at branches closer to the ground for one to
pick them easily reminding one of the statement in parmArtha sthuthi (PraNathai:
GruhyathE palam).
b These fruits picked by the devotees through the act of salutation of the Lord are ripe, sweet
and pure (Suddha Satva
mayam).
b Swami Desikan is also
reminded of the cool and
far-enveloping shade of
this tree and compares it to
t h e V a a s u d E v a
tarucchAyA, which with its
lustre and shade enlivens
and protects the world.
The word ChAyA has been
i n t e r p r e t e d b y t h e
commentators as to mean
both shade and lustre. The
Lord's radiance makes the
Sun, Agni and the Moon
l u s t r o u s a n d t h e i r
effulgence is thus directly
derived from the Lord's
chAyA. This VaasudEvaTrivikrama TamAla tree
extends its shadow far and
wide and envelops the
entire world under its
shade and comforts the
denizens of the universe.
The first slOkam of this
Sthuthi spoke of the Lord's
BhUmnA, the second of His
Iswarathvam, the third of His
position as the Lord of the
dEvAs and the asurAs and the fourth as the fruit-laden, ever green tree to be enjoyed by one and
all .

O Supreme Lord of Gopapuri ! the adverse (punishing) and fierce disposition of Your
ChakrAyudham (Sudarsanam) towards the evil-minded asurAs and the partial as well as the
protective aspects of Your sankham (Paanchajanyam) towards Your asritha janAs is clearly
demonstrated at Your divya desam through the change in their traditional positions of Your
hands. Here You are adorning the chakram on Your left upper hand and the sankham on the
upper right hand in an altered manner compared to Your traditional way .
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan has extraordinary skills in using utprEkshA or slEshA (sledai or pun) in his
sthuthis. For example in GodhA sthuthi (verse 6 : sONAdharEpi) and YathirAja sapthathi (Verse
16: alUna pakshasya), we enjoy this skill being displayed with great effect. Here, in this verse of
DehaLIsa sthuthi, Swami Desikan adroitly uses the double meanings of the words, Vaamam and
DakshiNam.
slOkam 5 
sadagopan.org
32
Vaamam means left side as well as fierce
(unfavorable); dakshiNam refers to the right
side as well as partial or favorable disposition
(dAkshiNyam).
Since Chakram is fierce towards the asurAs
and is seen therefore on the left hand (vAma
hastham); sankham is partial (dakshiNam ) to
saraNAgathAs and hence it is found on the
dakshiNa hastham (right hand) of the Lord in
this divya desam, where He blessed Maha
Bali. DehaLIsan according to Swami Desikan
demonstrates the nature of the two
aayudhams (Sankham and Chakram) by
holding them in the right (dakshiNam ) and
left (vAmam) hands respectively .
Thirumangai has hinted at the special alteration of the normal positions of Chakram and
Sankham on the Lord's hands here indirectly in one of his ThirukkOvalUr paasuram (Periya
Thirumozhi 2.10.9):
thU vadivil pArmahaL pUmangayOdu sudarAzhi thU vadivil pArmahaL pUmangayOdu sudarAzhi thU vadivil pArmahaL pUmangayOdu sudarAzhi
sankirupAl polinthu thOnra sankirupAl polinthu thOnra sankirupAl polinthu thOnra - - - .
Here Thirumangai refers to sudarAzhi (Chakram) on the side of pArmahaL (BhUmi dEvi) and
Sanku (Paanchajanyam) on the right side, where Sri Devi traditionaly stays. Thus the AzhwAr
links "pArmahaLOdu SudarAzhi" and "pUmangayOdu sanku". Swami Desikan goes on to
explain what that reverse positioning of the Lord's aayudhams on His hands relative to the
traditional position of His ubhaya NAcchiyArs is all about .
For the devout devotee, the child DhruvA, the Lord used the sankham on His right hand
(DakshiNa hastham) to touch the cheek of the child lost in the meditation over Him and brought
DhruvA back to consciousness and to bless him with His darsanam. Here too at ThirukkOvalUr,
dEhaLIsan reminds the world about the significance of the two aayudhams with respect to the
righteous ones and those, who commit Bhagavadh /BhagavathApachArams .

MEANING
In the sixth slOkam, Swami Desikan describes how the three AzhwArs managed to see the Lord
in the dEhaLi of Sage Mrigandu's aasramam with the help of the special lamps (deepams) that
they lit. Swami Desikan elaborates on the power of the special deepams that they lit.
Those holy men were princes among poets. With VedAs and yoga (dhyAnam) as their two eyes,
they saw you, while you were actively squeezing them in the small space of the dEhaLi at
ThirukkOvalUr during that celebrated midnight known for its darkness due to the absence of
the lustre of the cool moon. They saw you with the help of a special kind of lamp, which had
snEhA (ghee, bhakthi) as the fuel and sathva guNA as the wick. With this special lamp, they
found you pressing them in the small space of their heart caves.
COMMENTS :
This slOkam celebrates the auspicious event for which ThirukkOvalUr is famous (viz)., the
accidental assembly of the three great yOgis at the dEhaLi of Mrugandu maharishi on a dark
night and the deliberate squeezing of them by the Lord of this divya dEsam that resulted in the
advent of the divya prabhandhams from these princes among poets.
It is normal for the moon to illumine objects duirng dark nights. On that special night, there was
slOkam 6 
sadagopan.org
34
no moon to assist these Yogis to find out, what was squeezing them at the dEhaLi. Hence, they
lit an extraordinary lamp with the help of their deep devotion and sattva guNAs to have the
bhAgyam of His darsanam.
It is also common practice for people to take an
earthen or metallic vessel, fill it with ghee or oil,
set a wick in that vessel and light the wick and use
it to see objects around in dark nights. What these
yOgis did was quite contrary to this common
practice. Poygai made the world as the lamp
vessel, the seas as the ghee and used Suryan as the
wick to illumine the dark dEhaLi. BhUthathAr
used his deep affection for the Lord as the vessel,
his intense longing to see Him as the ghee and
made his reflections on His auspicious guNAs
(dhyAna-janitha chinthanA) as the wick and
created the light to see Him. PEy aazhwAr saw
that the darkness was banished by the two lamps
lit by his peers and hence with out any effort other
than his own pristine bhakthi saw the Lord and
His consort amidst them. The divine speech that
flowed from them took the form of the celestial
songs constituting the first three prabhandhams.
These three great princes among poets have been
saluted as "kaveendhrA:" by Swami Desikan here
following their own abhivAdhanam of themselves
and the eulogies of them by other AchAryAs. BhUthathar introduced himself for instance as
“perum Tamizhan (great Tamizhan)" and as "JnAna Tamizh purindha naan" (as the one, who
composed divine poetry). Thiruvarangatthu AmudanAr has saluted PEyAzhwAr as "Tamizh
Talaivan“ (Chief among Tamizh poets). Poygai has been eulogized as "Kavij~nar pOrEru" (the
most powerful bull/vrushabham among poets) in the taniyan for Mudal thiruvandhAthi. Swami
Desikan has saluted their poetic skills collectively as "Paattukkuriya pazhayavar moovar" (the
ancient and the hoary threesome) in Srimadh Rahasya traya saaram.
Swami Desikan described that the three parama yOgis saw the Lord with the choice of the word,
"dadhrusu:". The Lord can not be seen according to the VedAs and Bhagavadh GithA. The Lord
declares in Srimadh Bahgavdh GithA:
na thu sakyasE dhrashtum anEnaiva svachakshush, na thu sakyasE dhrashtum anEnaiva svachakshush, na thu sakyasE dhrashtum anEnaiva svachakshush,
divyam dadhAmi tE chakshu: pasya mE yOgamaisvaram divyam dadhAmi tE chakshu: pasya mE yOgamaisvaram divyam dadhAmi tE chakshu: pasya mE yOgamaisvaram
"But thou can not see me with these eyes of thine; I will give thee super sensuous sight; behold
my yoga power-supreme with those divya chakshus“.
Kacchi Poigai AzhwAr 
sadagopan.org
35
The three saw what had not been seen until then by a special kind of lamp (kEnachidh deepam).
Their special deepam was the power of their yOga siddhi, sattva guNAs and their supreme
devotion to the Lord. With these accessories, the first AzhwAr lit his lamp with the Sun as the
wick and removed the external darkness. The second AzhwAr lit his own lamp with his "pining
mind” as the wick and banished the internal darkness. These two lamps have no equal.
Swami Desikan has saluted the jyothi arising from these unique lamps and their assistance to the
people of the world this way :
" nAttukku iruL seha , " nAttukku iruL seha , " nAttukku iruL seha ,
naanmaRai anthi nadai viLanga , naanmaRai anthi nadai viLanga , naanmaRai anthi nadai viLanga ,
veetukkidaikkazhikkE veLi kaatum veetukkidaikkazhikkE veLi kaatum veetukkidaikkazhikkE veLi kaatum
immey vilakkE " immey vilakkE " immey vilakkE "
"Thus arose the true light of the lamp -- the three prabhandhams-- which resulted in the
banishment of the darkness of false knowledge prevalent in the world and illumined the land
with the jyOthi of the distilled essence of the vEdAs and revealed for our upliftment , the two
upAyAs : Bhakthi and Prapatthi."
This is the mEy viLakku that Swami Desikan alludes to as "kenachidh deepam", which shed
light over the ancient and glorious path carved out by the vEdAs and upanishads.
Swami Desikan born under the light of the Deepa PrakAsan's agrahAram in ThirutaNNkA
(ThUppul) had a great fascination for the deepams, which to him are synonyms for supreme
tattvAs. In this sixth verse, he refers to "deepEna kEnachidh", the eternal deepams lit by the
AzhwArs at ThirukkOvalUr.
Sri D.Ramaswamy Iyengar has pointed out that Swami Desikan saluted AchArya RaamAnujA
himself as the eternal lamp known as "yathikshamAbruth deepam" (verse 56). That deepam is
“nirupadhi para snEha bharitha yathikshamAbhruddh deepam“ (natural and pristinely pure
lamp filled with the oil of supreme devotion to Sriman NaarAyaNA known as the BhaashyakAra
Deepam). Sri D. Ramaswamy Iyengar has further suggested that Swami Desikan out of his
modesty named this work relating to the dispelling of the aj~nAnam of chEthanAs as "deepikA"
instead of deepam. Sri D.R. Iyengar invites hence our special attention to the last skOkam of this
DeepikA dealing with SaraNAgathi tatvam:
snEhOpapanna vishaya sva dasA visEshAth
bhUyas tamisra samaneem bhuvi VenkatEsa : I bhUyas tamisra samaneem bhuvi VenkatEsa : I
divyAm sthuthim niramimeetha sathAm niyOgAth
DeepaprakAsa SaraNAgathi deepikAkyAm II DeepaprakAsa SaraNAgathi deepikAkyAm II
MEANING
The VedAnthAchAryan known as Sri VenkatEsan created this profound eulogy known as
SaraNAgathi DeepikA on VilakkoLi PerumAL (Deepa PrakAsan). In this work, he elaborated on 
sadagopan.org
36
the svarUpam and svabhAvam of the Lord, who is full of DayA and affection for the chEthanAs.
Therefore, this sthOthram will banish the aj~nAnam and drive away the dark clouds of
vipariitha Jn~nam.
Swami Desikan took a clue from the prabhandhams of the three AzhwArs and named his sthuthi
on DeepaprakAsan as DeepikA or Deepam. He uses the uthprEkshA (pun) again for the words in
this slOkam: snEha-dasA-tamisra samanee-prakAsa.
“Sneha upapanna” in the above verse can mean either full of affection or full of oil;
“sva dasA visEshAth” can mean either the special approaches used in the sthuthi or the rest of
the wick;
“tamisra samaneem” can mean either capable of removing false knowledge or external darkness.
Thus Swami Desikan equated SaraNAgathi DeepikA to a lamp. Its oil, wick, darkness-removing
quality, lustre were compared to snEha, dasA, tamisra samnee and prakAsam of this deepikA. It
is no accident that Sawmi Desikan used the words "SnEhOpapanna" in both the DehaLIsa
sthuthi (verse 6) and SaraNAgathi DeepikA (verse 59). In DehaLIsa sthuthi, it refers to the
bhakthi-laden mind set of the AzhwArs, while they lit their special lamps; in the SaranAgathi
DeepikA, it refers to the affection-laden frame of mind of Swami Desikan as he lit his own lamp
before the VilakkoLi perumAL, while elaborating on SaraNAgathi tattvam of the Lord for our
benefit.
Sri D.Ramaswamy Iyengar comments in this context: "The AzhwArs showed by the lamps lit by
them the SUPREME TATTVA. Swami Desikan has shown that the SUPREME MEANS TO
ATTAIN THAT TATTVA”.

MEANING
In this slOkam, Swami Desikan salutes the great upahAram that the three AzhwArs did in
revealing the sowseelya guNam of BhagavAn. Sowseelyam aspect of BhagavAn relates to His
Sama bhAvam that permits Him to mingle with the high and the low with equal ease. Sri D.R.
IyengAr describes this slOkam as a very sweet one for us to enjoy.
"The large quantity of juice that was produced when Thou, who art sweet like the sugarcane
growing on the banks of the river PeNNai, were crushed by (the crushing mill made up of) the
three great poets, evidently attained the state of fresh sugar at the honey of Thy feet enjoyed by
those, who are devoted to Thee to the exclusion of all else “.
COMMENTS
Sri D.R. Iyengar described this slOkam as a delectably sweet one because it deals with the sweet
mystical experience of the three AzhwArs, when they extracted the sweet essence of the Lord,
when He squeezed them tightly at the dEhaLi of sage Mrugandu. Swami Desikan associates their
sweet mystical experience to the taste of sugar cane, its juice and the rock candy originating from
it mingling with the honey of the Lord's sacred feet.
The Lord of ThirukkOvalUr residing at His divya dEsam on the banks of PeNNARu is compared
to the tasty sugarcane growing there (PaNNA tatEshu subhaga:). He is as enjoyable as the sweet
slOkam 7 
sadagopan.org
38
sugarcane growing abundantly even today on the banks of the PeNNARu. Swami Desikan, who
had a great admiration for Thirumangai followed the dhvani of Thirumangai's paasuram in this
slOkam. The specific reference is to the fourth paasuram on ThirukkOvalUr (2.10.4) by
Thirumangai, where he describes first the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr as the nectar for the bhakthAs,
who eulogize Him with tears of joy welling in their eyes.
aangarumbi kaNNeer sorindhu anbu kUrum adiyavarkku aar amudham aanAn. aangarumbi kaNNeer sorindhu anbu kUrum adiyavarkku aar amudham aanAn. aangarumbi kaNNeer sorindhu anbu kUrum adiyavarkku aar amudham aanAn.
Next, Thirumangai compares the three AzhwArs to the honey bees tasting
the delectable juice of the unique sugarcane standing on the banks of PeNNARu:
 "----kuzhAm varivandu isai paadum paadal kEttu, kuzhAm varivandu isai paadum paadal kEttu, kuzhAm varivandu isai paadum paadal kEttu,
theenkarumbu kaNN vaLarum kazhani soozhndha theenkarumbu kaNN vaLarum kazhani soozhndha theenkarumbu kaNN vaLarum kazhani soozhndha
ThirukkOvalurathanuL kandEn nAnE " . ThirukkOvalurathanuL kandEn nAnE " . ThirukkOvalurathanuL kandEn nAnE " .
The dhvani in the above paasuram section of Kaliyan has been pointed out as focussed on the
word "karumbu" and “kuzhAvarivandisai". The AayanAr of ThirukkOvalUr is the sugarcane
(karumbu) and the three prabhandhams of the mudal AzhwArs are the songs of the honey bees
(kuzhAvari vandisai). That was the delectable naama sankeerthanam generated by the three
AzhwArs as a result of their taste of the sweet juice of the sugarcane (AayanAr) growing on the
banks of PeNNARu. The ecstasy arising from their bhakthi to the Lord, who out of His
sowseelya guNam mingled with them and made them enjoy Him as "nUthana sakkarA" or fresh
sugar made from the juice of that sugarcane. This nUthana Sakkara is so sweet that it ends up
enhancing the natural sweetness of honey flowing from the Lord's sacred feet.
AzhwArs and AchAryAs are
fond of comparing the Lord to
sweet sugarcane and His lotus
feet to sweet nectar. For
instance, PeriyAzhwAr has
compared the Lord to Kannal
(sugarcane) and others have
saluted Him as akkArakkani.
AlavandhAr has saluted the
nectar flowing out of the Lord's
lotus feet and has asked
rhetorically, how anyone that
has laid his soul at your lotus
feet exuding nectar-like honey,
develop a taste for anything
else?
Swami Desikan weaves the above themes in his seventh slOkam, when he refers to the Lord as
Ikshu subhagan (sweet like ripe sugarcane). The Lord’s sowseelyam is described by Swami as
"bahu rasa:" (plenty of juice). Vedam itself enjoys the Lord as " RasOvaisaha:" (bliss absolute).
Kadalmallai bhUthathAzhwAr with PerumAK and thAyar 
sadagopan.org
39
These azhwArs (kAsAra pUrva kavi mukyA:) serving
as the three rollers in a sugarcane crushing mill
produced abundantly flowing juice (the three hundred
paasurams), which crystallized into a sugar hill as
visualized by Swami Desikan in the first slOkam of
DayA sathakam (Ikshu sravanthyA iva yanmurthyA
sarkarAyitham).
Swami Desikan refers to the ananya bhakthi of the
three AzhwArs as "tvadhananya BhOgyE" echoing the
question of AlavandhAr, "tavAmruthassyanthi paada
pankajE nivEsithAthmA katham anyath icchathi?" The
three AzhwArs enjoyed the "Bahu rasam" of the Lord's
nectar-sweet feet just like the sweetness associated
with the mixture of fresh sugar with honey (Tvadh
paadha padhma madhuni nUthana sarkarAthvam).
Lord's sowseelya guNam makes the enjoyment of the
Lord's nectar-like feet parama bhOgyam to the
AzhwArs and through them to Swami Desikan and
finally to us.

MEANING
From the sloka 8 to 16 of Sri DehaLIsa sthuthi, Swami DEsikan focuses on the many beautiful
aspects of the Lord's avathAram as Trivikraman.
O Lord of ThirukkOvalUr! Once upon a time, you took on the role of a small dwarf and went to
Bali chakravarthi"s yAga Saalai and got as gift three steps of land. Immediately after receiving
that dhAnam, you wished to occupy the entire universe and you accomplished this goal in a trice
through your dancing feet of the rapidly growing TrivikramA form. Thus, you pervaded the
seven worlds. At that time, you looked like a blue cloud (girdle) encircling the seven worlds. The
lustre of your makara kundalams adorning your ears shone like flashes of lighting originating
from that blue cloud of your subha tanu (auspicious body). You who expanded to enfold the
seven worlds as Trivikrama are now happy to be crushed in a little space of a dEhaLi by the three
bhakthAs of yours!
COMMENTS
Swami DEsikan states that the Lord took on the role of Vamana Brahmachari as an actor who
dons a role on stage. MahA Bali, the grandson of PrahlAdhAzhwAn was a great bhakthan and
parama vaidhikan. However, his ego drove him to cause a lot of harm to devas. The Lord had to
slOkam 8 
sadagopan.org
41
control him and teach him a lesson. Hence he took on the role of a kapata Vaamana brahmachAri
and came to MahA Bali's yAgam. Humbly, the Lord asked the emperor Bali to deed Him three
steps of land measured by his tiny steps. MahA Bali felt that the little dwarf was asking him
such a trivial gift and encouraged the Vaamana BrahmachAri to ask for some thing
commensurate with his status as the emperor, who had vanquished the dEvAs.
Our Lord persisted in his request for three steps of land and the unsuspecting Bali was ready to
pour water on the hands of the Vamana mUrthy to seal the deed. SukrAchArya, the guru of Bali
chakravarthy figured out that the dwarf was none other than Sriman NaarAyaNA standing in
front as the kapata vAmanan to deprive his disciple of his empire and status. SukrAchArya
protested to Bali and asked him not to consummate the requested dhAnam. The generous and
proud Bali would not hear of going back on his word and went ahead with the gift and poured
water on the hand of VaamanA bhagavAn and completed the deeding.
The Lord, who got His way was
elated with joy and began to perform
a dance, which consisted of one foot
spreading over the earth as if it was
measuring it; the other foot shot
upward to envelop the sky and
beyond (VikrAnthi). The word
vikrAnthi has yet another meaning
beyond enveloping; it also means
heroic or valorous. This heroic
vikrAnthi of a dance ended up
enveloping the seven worlds just as a
cloud that forms a girdle (mEkalai)
around the globe. The Vaamana
murthi took on the Viswa rUpam and
transformed Himself into Trivikraman. His color (vaNNam) is like the dark blue cloud of the
rainy season (Muhiluruvam). The Lord's makara kundalams (kundalams in the form of mythical
makara) adorning His ears shone like the lightning breaking out of the blue cloud of His
subhAsrayam. His form expanding and growing by leaps and bounds without let is saluted by
Swami Desikan here as "vikrAnthi taaNdava rasEna vijrumbhamANa: “
Swami Desikan has been inspired by Thirumangai Mannan's paasuram (8.1.3) on the Lord of
ThirukkaNNapuram when he refers to the Lord's Makara Kundalams shooting out their radiance
as lighting shafts. AzhwAr's words are: “minnu mAmaNi MAKARA KUNDALANGAL VIL
VEESUM “.
Swami DEsikan salutes in the spirit of Thirumangai the jyOthi of those Makara kundalams with
the choice of words:
"ChakrE bhavAn MAKARA KUNDALA KARNA PAASA: "ChakrE bhavAn MAKARA KUNDALA KARNA PAASA: "ChakrE bhavAn MAKARA KUNDALA KARNA PAASA:

In this verse, Swami DEesikan visualizes the
sowlabhayam of the Lord in permitting Him to be
circumscribed and squeezed by the Mudhal
AzhwArs in the space of a dEhaLi.
O Lord of ThirukkOvalUr! It does not appear as a
wonderous deed to us, when you transformed
yourself as TrivikramA and brought the entire
universe under your three steps; but, what fills us
with awe and wonder is what You did on a rainy
night at the small space of a dEhaLi in
ThirukkOvalUr. Then, You let Your gigantic body
spanning the entire universe get squeezed in
between the three AzhwArs, who themselves were
pressed against each other in the tight space of the
dEhaLi of Mrugandu muni's aasramam.

COMMENTS
Steeped in adhbhutha rasam, Swami DEsikan reflects on the form of Trivikraman that grew to
cosmic size compressing itself to enter the tiny space occupied tightly by the three bhakthAs of
His at the dEhaLi. In that mood of wonder (adhbhutham), the erstwhile act of the Lord sweeping
the sky and earth with two strides of His, pales into insignificance in the mind of our AchAryA.

MEANING
Swami addresses DehaLeesan and says: : O Lord who loves your devotees! When you grew as
Trivikrama to measure the worlds with your expanding steps, different scenarios presented
themselves before the eyes of those, who were blessed to witness that wondrous scene. During
the first stage, as Your head shot upward, the assembly of stars looked like a celestial canopy
(VithAnam); as you continued to grow and pierced that canopy, the assembly of stars appeared
like a pearl necklace around Your beautiful neck.
You went on growing. At the next stage, the cluster of stars descended down to the level of your
waist and there they took on the role of your waist band. Your TrivikramA form grew further and
now the assembly of stars was at the level of your ankle. There they appeared as resplendent
nUpurams (ankle ornaments). Such was your viswarUpam, where the sky hung at the level of
your ankles. Isn't it a miracle that you of such gigantic form shrank Yourself to a form that fitted
in the narrow space of a dEhaLi because of your affection for Your bhakthAs?
COMMENTS
Here, Swami DEsikan is still awe struck over the adhbhutham that happened at the tiny dEhaLi
at ThirukkOvalUr. The thought of the Lord, who expanded in all eight directions to pervade the
slOkam 10 
sadagopan.org
45
universe shrinking now to a tiny form to squeeze Him, fills the mind of Swami Desikan and he
once again reflects on that viswa rUpam of the Lord as Trivikraman. He concludes that it is the
bhaktha vaatsalyam of the Viswa rUpi that made Him take the tiny from to enter the crowded
dEhaLi to be near His dear ones.
In his dasAvathAra sthOthram, Swami Desikan has saluted the gigantic strides of Lord
Trivikraman as "Traivikrama: vikrama: na avathu". Swami's mind starts with the Lord's
thirumudi (crown) and ends at the sacred feet. He sees around those feet the sky (canopy with
bejeweled stars) serving as the silambhus (nUPurams). Swami visualizes that limitless form of
the Lord as TrivikramA transforming itself to a tiny form to fit the proportions of the dEhaLI to
be close to his parama bhakthAs.

O Lord of Gopa Puri! When You took on the role of prathama Asramam (Celibate) that is
required to seek bhikshA (alms), You created a curtain (yavanikA) of krishNAjinam (maan thOl
or the skin of a black antelope worn by brahmachAris). You created that curtain to hide your
consort MahA Lakshmi residing forever on your chest. When You transformed into Trivikrama
rUpam and revealed Your real self , then all the witnesses of the scene were blessed to have the
darsanam of Your consort, who with Her svayam-jyOthi makes Your chest region resplendent.

MahA Lakshmi on Your vakshasthalam, then they had no doubt about your nature as

COMMENTS
Here, Swami dEsikan salutes MahA lakshmi, who is never without Him. NammAzhwAr's
paasura line, "ahalahillEn yenru AlarmEl mangai urai mArbhA" must have come to Swami's
mind. He has pointed out to us in one of his MummaNikkOvai verse that MahA Lakshmi takes
an appropriate form to accompany Her Lord in every one of His avathArams. The situation
during His avathAram as a Vaamana BrahmachAri is a ticklish one. He is a celibate and is
supposed to be unmaaried; at the same time, He could not be without Sri Devi. He solved the
problem by hiding her under the krishNAjinam (deer skin) attached to His sacred thread. As a
kapata Vaamanan, he played this trick to "assert" His "Brahmacharyam".
slOkam 11

The Lord and His consort are an inseparable pair as Swami has acknowledged in Sri Sthuthi:
“nishprathyUha praNaya gatitham Devi nithya anapAyam, “nishprathyUha praNaya gatitham Devi nithya anapAyam, “nishprathyUha praNaya gatitham Devi nithya anapAyam,
VishNusthvam cha ithi anavadhi guNa VishNusthvam cha ithi anavadhi guNam DHVANDHVAM ANYONYA LAKSHYAM “. m DHVANDHVAM ANYONYA LAKSHYAM “. m DHVANDHVAM ANYONYA LAKSHYAM “.
Here, Swami has revealed that this extraordinary couple can be understood only through each
other and are united by the immeasurable bond of love for each other and therefore are
inseparable even for a second from each other. Hence there is no way for MahA Lakshmi to be
separated from Her Lord or for the Lord to be unaccompanied by her even if He has to take on
the role as a BrahmachAri during VamanAvathAram.
Swami explains in another slOkam of Sri Sthuthi that MahA Lakshmi takes on appropriate
avathArams to accompany Her Lord and those different forms are like the waves driven by the
wind of her sankalpam arising from the ocean of bliss, which is Her Para Roopam in Sri
Vaikuntam:

offered respectfully to wash the feet of revered ones) to Your sacred feet and became blessed.
Siva perumAn received the waters used to wash your feet (GangA) on His head and became
equally blessed. Today, those who worship You as the one who appeared at the DehaLi of
ThirukkOVilUr and carry on their head the water used for Your Thirumanjanam, they gain the
combined advantages gained by Brahma Devan and Lord SivA at the same moment ."
COMMENTS
Slokas 12-16 cover the many aspects of the unimaginable beauty of Sri DehaLeesan.
Swami Desikan uses sledai or double meaning, when he uses the words ChathurAnan and
Sivan. ChathurAnan can mean either the four-faced Brahma or chathura--Ananan (one who can
speak cleverly, with chAthuryam). Sivan can mean Rudran or Auspiciousness (Sivam).
Swami says that those, who worship the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr attain instantly the blessings
that ChathurAnan and Sivan attained by offering paadhyam to the Lord's sacred feet and
receiving that paadhyam water (GangA) on His head. Swami says that the bhagyasaalis on earth
attain ChathurAnanathvam and Sivathvam together thru their worship of the DehaLeesan's
sacred feet at ThirukkOvalUr. SIMULTANEOUSLY, those puNyavAns attain the state of Siva
and ChathurAnanA as opposed to receiving such blessings thru separate acts (i.e), one washed
the Lord's sacred feet and the other received those sacred waters that emanated as AkAsa GangA
on His Jatai .
In one of his Naanmughan ThiruvandhAthi, Thirumazhisai AzhwAr describes the offer of
paadhyam by BrahmA from his kamandalu theertham and Lord Siva receiving that fast moving
slOkam 12 
sadagopan.org

torrent of GangA on His matted hair to protect the worlds from damage of its powerful descent:

kandatthAn senni mElERakkazhuvinAn
andatthAn sevadiyai aangu
Thirumazhisai visualizes BrahmA pouring water on the upward moving foot of the Lord as it
passed thru his abode, Satya Lokam, to the accompaniment of Veda Mantrams. He visualizes
next Lord Sivan blocking those torrential and free-falling waters by receiving them on His
densely matted locks of hair. AzhwAr says that both BrahmA and Lord Sivan offered thus their
worship to TrivikramaavathAran.
A great Swami Desika BhakthA, Sri D.Ramaswamy Iyengar sums up the message of this slOkam
this way: “O DehaLyadheesA! You who were once a TrivikramA of Cosmic proportions now
revel in confining yourself to a small DehaLi. Even so, on those who worship You, You confer the
boons of simultaneous ChathurAnanathvam and Sivathvam. "

O Bhaktha uparOdha saha! O Lord who put up with the tight squeeze caused by the mudal
aazhwArs! When you grew as Trivikramaa and shot up towards the brahmAndam, your sacred
feet traveled past the BrahmA's world (Sathya Lokam). There, your son, BrahmA worshipped
those holy feet with the waters from his kamandalu and performed Thirumanjanam. The
sanctified waters of that abhishEkam were borne by Lord Siva on His head like the holy garland
to purify His head. Those waters of AkAsa Ganga were then released by Lord Siva and they
flowed like the flood made up of honey (PuNyA mandhAkini makarandha dhaarA). Anyone,
who bathes in these sacred waters, reaps the benefits of dharmam, artham and kaamam. Such a
bath in the waters associated with your holy feet cleanses the minds of the bathers and blesses
them to perform SaraNAgathi at Your feet and gain mOkshAnugraham. O Lord! How
magnificent indeed is the glory of Your CharaNAravindhams?
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan visualizes the crush experienced by the Lord's lotus feet resulting in the flow of
makarandha-dhArA. In the seventh slOkam, Swami had suggested that the Lord was being
squeezed by the AzhwArs like a sugarcane bundle to yield sugar juice. It has also been pointed
out that PeNNAr flowing at ThirukkovalUr is the honey-river flowing out of the Lord's lotus
feet. PEyAzhwAr has visualized this scene of what happened at Sathya lOkam and provided the
inspiration for Swami Desikan. The paasuram section of PEyAzhwar is as follows:

O Lord who has your dear devotees as your life! You conquered the worlds back from MahA
Bali. The River Ganga that flowed from your feet and traveling through the majestic, golden
HimAlayAs became like the waving flag symbolizing your victory. Those holy waters reached
first the cosmic sphere of SimsumAra chakram and next in order to Dhruva mandalam, Chandra
mandalam, Surya Mandalam, the Meru mountain, Lord Siva"s head at Kailas on the HimAlayAs
and finally reached this earth. Thus GangA nadhi spreads the glorious victory of Yours over Bali
Chakravarthy all over your worlds.
COMMENTS
The torrential, white waters of Ganga at the upper reaches of HimalayAs is indeed like a fast
fluttering flag as it descends to the gorges and reaches to the plains. This simile of the flowing
GangA as a flag fluttering in the winds is a beautiful one. The choice of the word "natha
Jeevitha" in this verse has been pointed out as reference to the three AzhwArs, who stood before
the Lord with bent heads and prostrated before Him. He is the Natha Sathyan and melts before
anyone holding anjali mudrA. Such is His bhaktha DaakshiNyam.

O Lord DehaLeesA! The flood of sacred waters that flowed out of your own sankalpam from
your uplifted feet branched off into three divisions and reached dEva lOkham, Manushya
lOkham and the nether world. Those three streams then took on the form of the three
thiruvandhAthis associated with Poygai, BhUtham and pEy aazhwAr and finally returned to
your sacred feet. Swami suggests that they started like Ganga at His sacred feet and returned to
them.
COMMENTS
In this verse, Swami Desikan celebrates the advent of the Three ThiruvanthAdhis by the Mudhal
AzhwArs.
The triple stream of Ganga (srOthAsthrayam) is compared here to the three floods of divine
utterances that emanated from the three aazhwArs. The Lord's celebrated feet, the origin of
GangA in TrivikramAvathAram, is the goal of the parama bhakthAs assembled in the DehaLi of
ThirukkOvalUr sthOthra priyan.
The unanimity of thought and purpose of the three AzhwArs is compared to the three branches
of the same river (srOthasthrayam). The tradition is to enjoy these three prabhandhams in
unison. They have the tatthva trayam with the extraordinary beginnings, which are echoes of one
another: VayamE tahaliyA, AnbE tahaLiyA and ThirukkanDEn.
Similarly, Tattva, Hitha and PurushArtham, another triad, is connected to the AzhwArs'
Parabhakthi, Paraj~nAnam and Parama Bhakthi. Sri D.Ramaswamy Iyengaar points out this
connectivity and reminds us that these andhAthis are affectionately named “VyatthandhAthi,
slOkam 16 
sadagopan.org
56
AnbhandhAthi and ThiruvandhAthi “.
Sri D.R IyengAr also speculates that Kumaara VaradAchAr, the son of Swami Desikan might
have been inspired by this verse to consider Srimadh Rahasya Thraya Saaram of his AchAryA as
“sthOthra Trayam":
VigAhE NigamAnthArya VishNupaadha SamudhbhavAm I VigAhE NigamAnthArya VishNupaadha SamudhbhavAm I
Rahasya thraya sArAkhyam thrisrOthasamakalamashAm II Rahasya thraya sArAkhyam thrisrOthasamakalamashAm II
He salutes his father's (AchAryA’s) magnum opus as originating like the GangA with the three
branches (the three andhAthis of Mudal AzhwArs) from the sacred feet of Sriman VishNu
NaarAyaNan.
In the remaining twelve slOkAs, Swami Desikan describes the Lord lifting the three AzhwArs to
His Parama Padham and then requests the Lord to grant him a similar boon of nithya
kaimkaryam at Sri VaikuNTham.

O Lord of ThirukkOvalUr! You are always fond of sporting with your adiyArs. You joined the
three devotees of yours at the small space of a DehaLI and squeezed them. They experienced you,
saw You and eulogized with the most exquisite paasurams. You were naturally very pleased. You
wanted to confer special boons on them and decided to create a broad highway for them to travel
without congestion as in the archirAdhi maargam. It appears that the effulgence of the nails of
your uplifted foot radiated far and wide as though to serve as the broad raaja maargam for their
travel to your parama padham.
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan refers to the Lord's special blessings to the Mudal AzhwArs.
The Lord seemed to make amends for playing games on His aarAdhakAs by squeezing them
tightly at the small space of a dEhaLI. He decided to create a king's highway marked by the red
lustre of His toe-nails.

MEANING
O Lord of the DehaLI! Your daya is an
infinite ocean. It is enough if even a
small drop from that limitless ocean to
fall on the chethanA, who is sinking in
the quick sand of perishable worldly
pleasures. That pitiable state arises from
their avivEkham. When the droplet of
Your DayA falls on the ChEthanA, that
expands into the many branches of
Bhakthi and Prapatthi as UpAyams. That
drop will grow as the wild fire and burn
away the samsaric afflictions of that
chEthanA. Thus a chEthanA spoiled by
his overpowering worldly desires quells
the fierce forest-fire of SamsArA.
Swami Desikan goes out of his way to
assure that the Lord's dayA is available
not only to the mudhal AzhwArs, but
also to every one wallowing in samsArA.
The tiniest particle of His mercy splits
into the two upAyams--Bhakthi and
Prapatthi--and banishes our samsAric
afflictions.

Swami says here that the Lord should not rescue him out of His dayA for him, but to please the
Lady, who came out of the milky Ocean and married Him. Swami describes his state as one of
extremely limited movement, since he is tightly bound by the ropes of the three guNaas. He
appeals to the Lord to treat him like He would treat the parrot with which He plays and lift him
up to parama padham after freeing him from the cage of sins.
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan begs the Lord to give him a hand so that His consort will be pleased over His act
of dayA.
Swami has a clever appeal here to the Lord. Please do not do it for me, but think of the joy of
Your consort, when She witnesses Your act of kindness to me, Her son. She will be overjoyed at
your display of dayA. Please release me from the cage of sins and release me out of your own
sankalpam in a sportive mood and fill the heart of your consort with joy says Swami Desikan.

O Lord, who bore with the pressure of your true devotees at a small space! I am one, who has
accumulated unlimited sins. Just as the winds of a cyclone grows the waves of the ocean to great
heights, my bundle of sins become larger and larger as a result of the enjoyment of the worldly
pleasures. As a result, my mind is in an agitated state. Fully knowing that there is no one except
You, who could banish my fear and restore my tranquility, please come to my rescue! Taking
note of my pitiable state, please shower Your nectar of mercy on me and save me !
COMMENTS
Swami DEsikan continues to appeal fervently to be rescued from the trammels of samsArA in
this and the subsequent verses.
O Lord! I am being tossed from here to there and all over by the huge waves of the ocean of
stormy samsArA. My state is like the dire one described by NammAzhwAr before:
aavArAr thuNai yenru alai neerkkadaluL azhundhum
naavAi pOl piravi kadaluL ninru naan thuLanga naavAi pOl piravi kadaluL ninru naan thuLanga
Sri D.Ramaswami IyengAr's decription of the state of Swami Desikan is moving: “You, my Lord,
know very well that except you no one can help me; no one else can dry out the sea, whose waves
are tossing me thus. See with Your own eyes my desperate plight and come to my rescue. Pray
extend your intense dayaa, which includes Grace, Mercy, Compassion, Sympathy and such other
similar sentiments.”

O Lord of ThirukkOvalUr! My sorrowful state characterized by my bundle of sins continues.
Even the stones will melt, when they take note of my helpless state. All those who see me will
surely be moved by my sufferings. You are the all powerful SarvEsvaran. You are witnessing this
too! How can your karuNA bear with the continuation of this state of mine? Your Daya will
surely come to my rescue. When you are alert to my sufferings, how can your DayA dEvi stay
quite?
COMMENTS
This slOkam has been recognized by the students of Swami Desikan’s works to be one of the
most moving pleas by him to the Lord. He describes his sins as sadhA mayi jAyamAnam or those
which keep growing in me. Sri D.R Swami compares the avasthA of Swami Desikan to that of
NammAzhwAr, when he declares, "Poyininra j~nanamum, pollA ozhukkumazhukkudambhum".
NammAzhwAr goes on to describe his state as one that the Lord alone can comprehend and as
being impossible to describe (inninra nErmai).
Swami Desikan describes further his state as the one at which even the stones will lament on
sight (dhrushathOpi vilApayantheem). Sri D.R. Swami recalls NammAzhwAr and Kamban’s
descriptions in this context. NammAzhwAr declared:
 “MarangaLum irangum vahai MaNivaNNa! Oh! “ “MarangaLum irangum vahai MaNivaNNa! Oh! “ “MarangaLum irangum vahai MaNivaNNa! Oh! “
Kamban described the unimaginable sorrow of Bharathan over the despicable deed of his mother
and calls BharathA as “kal kaniya kanihinra thuyarAn“ (One who melts away in grief of a
magnitude that will make even stones melt).

After this overpowering statement about his state of sorrow, Swami Desikan looks up at
DehaLeesan and recognizes that the Lord is all powerful, most compassionate and fully aware of
his sufferings. He begins to wonder how the Lord's DayA can be held under control. He cries
out: "Your DayA will certainly not put up with this condition of mine". He is consoled by the
thoughts of KurEsa under similar straits that made him declare:
tvadh j~nana sakthi karuNAsu satheeshu nEha tvadh j~nana sakthi karuNAsu satheeshu nEha tvadh j~nana sakthi karuNAsu satheeshu nEha
paapam parAkramithum arhathi maamakeenAm paapam parAkramithum arhathi maamakeenAm paapam parAkramithum arhathi maamakeenAm
KurEsa says here: "My sins should not get the upper hand as long as your J~nAnam, sakthi, and
Dayaa are all in tact and safe". KurEsa nudges the Lord and reminds Him of His capabilities lest
He forgot.
Swami Desikan follows the path of AzhwArs and remembers that the sakthi alone of the Lord
without His karuNA will not be of much use in rescuing the suffering ones.
His SaraNAgatha rakshakthvam can come into full play, only when His sakthi and DayA ride in
tandem. As the supreme being, it is His duty to protect us and we have no other refuge as
reminded by AzhwAr:
KaLaivAi thunbham kaLaiyAthu ozhiyAyai kaLaikaNN maRRilEn
Your Dayaa will come to my rescue

O Lord of the DehaLI! I am one, who seeks my advancement and the lowering of the fortune for
others (Athma unnathim Para nikarsham iha vaanchan) in this world of yours. I am the most
selfish of the lot. Therefore, I have fallen into the deep waters of the ocean of a~jnAnam. It is
the tradition to throw a strong rope to the one, who has fallen into waters to lift him up. I beg
you to lift me with Your rope known as KaruNA and bring me up to the level of Your uplifted
foot. Your Thiruvadi has shot beyond the andam and when you bring me there, I would have
safely crossed samsAra mandalam and thus be blessed with Mukthi.
COMMENTS
This slOkam is a prayer by Swami Desikan to the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr to lift him up from the
ocean of nescience into which he has fallen.
Sri D.R. Iyengar points out that this slOkam deals with the passages of Utthara
KrithyAdhikAram of Sri Rahasya Thraya Saaram. There, our compassionate AchAryA warns
against the pride that comes before collapsing if gained by limited insights on Bhagavadh
Vishayam.
The one who has gained limited awareness of the greatness of Our Lord thru apprenticeship as a
novice suddenly thinks that he is superior and looks down on others and falls into "Padukuzhi"
or camouflaged pit .
Swami describes it in RTS as "SvOthkarsha paranikarshangaL aahira padukuzhi ".

Sri D.R. Iyengar cites other instances from Swami Desikan's works, such as Sankalpa
SuryOdhayam. There, the characters DambhA (Vanity) and DarpA (conceit) are presented after
the PurushA (Jeevan) gains limited victory over the inauspicious guNAs like Kaama (desire) and
KrOdhA (anger).
Swami Desikan's modesty, fairness and compassion are well known. He forgave generously
those, who offended him. He has said clearly:
“Naam periyOm allOm, nanrum theethum namakku uraippAr uLar yenru nAduvOmE”
"We do not consider ourselves great in achievements; we continually seek those, who can instruct
us on the right and wrong".
The recipe offered by Swami Desikan against "swollen with pride" is a powerful and moving
one.

O Lord who enjoyed the pressure of being squeezed by your devotees at the dEhaLi! My appetite
for increasing my sins has not abated a bit. In spite of it, I dare to appeal to you to rescue me
based on my awareness of your dayAsvarUpam. I am emboldened further to engage in this
appeal, when I see the KaruNAmayi--my Mother seated next to You. Therefore, please come to
the rescue of this one, who has limited awareness of what is good and what is not. Please
consider what is good for me and bless me with that.
COMMENTS
In the earlier slOkams, Swami had asked for one boon or the other. Now, Swami realizes that he
is of "alpa bhuddhi" and may not therefore be fully aware of what is of lasting goodness to him.
In recognition of his limits, Swami apologizes to the Lord and leaves it to the Lord to command
that which is the most appropriate (hitham) for him in the spirit of the JitanthE sthOthram
passage :
kvAham athyantha dhurbhuddhi:, kva cha aathma hitha veekshaNam I kvAham athyantha dhurbhuddhi:, kva cha aathma hitha veekshaNam I

MEANING
Who am I with my profoundly ill-informed mind? What would I know of the subjects that are
good for me? Therefore, my Lord, please command for my upliftment, whatever is appropriate
for me out of the depth of Your kindness and Sarva~jnathvam .

Swami Desikan chooses in this slOkam a word from Srimadh RaamAyaNam (aanrusamsyam).
There, Sri RamachandrA has defined for His Devi what the most superior dharmam is:
"Aanrusamsyam parO dharma:" "Aanrusamsyam parO dharma:"
Sri RamA has been saluted by our Swami as "DharmO VigrahavAn" or the embodiment of
DharmA in DasAvathAra sthOthram. This Dharma svarUpan explains that aanrusamsayam is
the greatest of DharmAs. Anrusamsyam is "the negation of wickedness or maliciousness" in
others. That arises from boundless, innate compassion for those, who commit offenses such as
KaakAsurA. Once they performed saraNAgathi, the guNam of aanrusamsyam comes into the
fore to forgive the offenders. Adhi Kavi Vaalmeeki lists this redeeming quality of Sri Raama as
SaraNAgatha Rakshakan as top most of all His auspicious guNAs as PurushOtthaman.
Swami reminds us according to Sri D.R .Iyengar the quotation by SithA piratti on Sri Rama’s
upadEsam that Anrusamsyam is the supreme dharmam.
When SithA piratti's statement comes to the fore, one can understand the fine point of Swami
Desikan seeking protection of the Lord in front of MahA Lakshmi (Lakshmi Samakshamapi
vi~jnApayAmi) .
In this slOkam, Swami admits that he may not know clearly, what is good for him (avidhitha nija
yOga kshEma:) and leaves it to the Lord to make the best choice for him in the manner suggested
by PeriyAzhwAr and Thirumangai AzhwAr earlier :
NinnaruLE purindhirEnthEn; Iniyen ThirukkurippE (PeriyAzhwAr)
unn manatthAl yen ninaindhirunthAi ? (Thirumangai)
Swami ceases therefore to pray for any specific boon and leaves the choice up to the Lord.

O Lord of ThirukkOvalUr! AchAryAs have pointed out that those, who have no other UpAyams
are eligible to choose SaraNAgathi as the UpAyam to receive MokshAnugraham. I am incapable
of practicing any other upAyam. I do not even know and am similar to an infant that does not
know what it has to do to nourish itself. You have blessed me to perform my prapatthi at your
lotus feet and have accepted it. When I reflect on this SowbhAghyam, it becomes clear to me
that it is Your DayA that has made you take pity on me, the helpless. You decided that I should
not go after hard-to-practice upAyAs and made me incapable of going after them and
experiencing hardships. Thus I acquired the fitness to perform Prapatthi. That fitness has made
me rich to possess the imperishable wealth of Moksham.
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan thanks the Lord of ThirukkOvalur for conferring on him the status of
aakinchanathvam, the state of being poor and destitute and without any means (upAyam). That
in turn showed the way to the Lord to Swami Desikan choosing SaraNAgathi, as his means for
salvation and the Lord quickly accepting his self-surrender.
Sri D.R. Iyengar swami quotes the DayA sathaka slOka passage to support this line of argument
by Swami Desikan. There Swami salutes the DayA Devi:
“ManyE MaathA Jata iva suthE VatsalA “ “ManyE MaathA Jata iva suthE VatsalA “
Here Swami says: “O Daya Devi! I think that you are fond of us in a manner and measure in
which a mother is fond of a child of hers with weak intellect”.
slOkam 25 
sadagopan.org

Swami Desikan's reverence to Akinchanyam as a great wealth to possess has been recorded in
the 47th slOkam of DEvanAyaka panchAsath (Nishkinchinathva DhaninA), where he recognizes
Akinchanathvam, as a state of wealth and as a prerequisite to succeed in one's saraNAgathi .

MEANING
O Lord! There is no limit to the glories of your katAkshams. They have the power to destroy the
MahA paapams that can not be destroyed by any other means. Once Your glances fall on a MahA
paapi, all his sins are destroyed totally. They are capable of granting any desired boons. When
those glances blend with the gentle smile on Your face, it is the most delectable experience to
have. During those occasions, the flow of Daya from You will become transparent. When those
glances fall on me and I am saved, I conclude that You blessed me by mere looks instead of
expressing yourself through Your speech .
COMMENTS
Here Swami Desikan acknowledges the side glances of the Lord of ThirukkOvalUr as the
powerful reason for the blessings that he earned.
Swami Desikan celebrates here the Lord's capacity to speak thru His eyes, just as NammAzhwAr
experienced (Thoothu sey kaNNkaL kondonru pEsi). The glory of apAngam (side glances) over
the direct look of the Lord is celebrated here for its vAthsalyam (dayA bharithai: apAngai:)
Those mercy-laden glances are sweetened by the smitha darsaneeyai: (beautiful smile /
punsirippu). The end result is limitless Joy.
Swami Desikan chose another word Prathi vaavadhuthukai: to spell out the effect of those
powerful glances. VaavadhuthukA is a lawyer. Swami suggests that the Lord's glances cleverly
argue away our sins as DayA devi does .
Sri D.R. Swamin is eloquent about the Dayaa-laden katAkshams of the Lord (dayA

bharithairApAngA:). He says: "To DesikA, DayA is an aprathaksiddha-visEshaNam of the Lord's
eyes and their glances".
Innumerable indeed are the references in DesikA's works to the two of them (dayA and
KatAkshams) together.....
1. GOpAla Vimsathi: anukampAsaritham bhujairapAngai: (lotus floating in the stream of
DayA)
2. Hayagreva Sthuthi: DayAtarangAnucharA: KatAkshA:
3. DayA sathakam: sakeem thE SrinivAsasya dhrushtim (49th slOkam)
4. DayA sathakam: tadh veekshaNai : sprusa DayE tava kELi padmai : (98 th slOkam)
5. DEvanAyaka PanchAsath: adhivEla dayOttharangam vilOchanam
If AzhwArs lost themselves in the beauty of the Lord's eyes, Desika has surrendered himself to
the grace of His KatAkshA. He says: vaacham vinA vadasi (you speak without words thru your
eyes). He saluted them elsewhere as "anAma vAkhya Garbhai:" glances pregnant with meaning
(saabhiprAyam).
Swami acknowledges in Sri DehaLeesa sthuthi that the Lord's faultless (anaga apAngams)
glances have given him the
anugraham without words.
That prasAdham is identified
by Sri D.R .Swami as the
acceptance of Swami Desikan
as the servant of the Lord.
The katAkshAs of the Lord
are the integrated essence of
their four attributes:
b purity,
b generosity (oudhAryam),
b beauty and
b grace.
Such a rich and powerful glance of the Lord has led to the anugraham of Swami Desikan at
ThirukkOvalUr.

MEANING
The three azhwArs were blessed to see the Lord in the dehaLi as a result of His squeezing them
there. That divyAnubhavam led to the advent of the three great andhAthis. They celebrated the
Lord’s svarUpam, thirumEni and kalyANa guNAs. This Lord wears the Sudarsanam and
Paanchajanyam on His hands and sportively destroys the mahA paapams of those who worship
Him. This He has taken as a vow.
May this magnificent Lord protect this world and its beings from any inauspiciousness!
COMMENTS
This slokam is a celebration of the anugraham of Sri DehaLeesan for those, who have received
Pancha samskAram. The first slOkam of this sthuthi is a prayer for Swami's personal protection
by the Lord. This slokam is a prayer for the protection of the entire world.
The Lord's dOhaLee (sankalpam) is to protect this world. Swami reminds Him of that vow. May
the Lord of DehaLee (DehaLeesa:) protect this world (Visvam avyAth ) !

MEANING
This sthuthi on the Lord of DEhaLee was composed by
VenkatEsa kavi, who has seen the banks of VedA.
There is not a word in this sthuthi, which is false in
meaning. The errors will come only when we sing
about ordinary mortals. Where is the chance for a false
note to be struck, when one sings about the
SarvEsvaran? We have a great attachment to worldly
goods and pleasures. We are misers, when it comes to
parting with our wealth. Therefore; we get stuck in
this desert land. This sthOthram is able to bless all
such people to overcome their miseries and receive all
they desire from the lofty Trivikraman of Gopapuri
celebrated thru these slOkAs.
COMMENTS
Swami Desikan points out that we are wandering
aimlessly in the desert of SamsArA and undergoing all
kinds of sufferings. We long for the blessings to end
these unbearable sufferings. Swami Desikan states
that the recitation of this sthOthram on the supreme
Lord of Gopapuram will grant them the boons to

overcome their sufferings.
Sri D.R. Swamin states that the power of this sthOthram arises from the powerful combination of
three factors:
1. Prabhandha VailakshaNyam arising from the purity and truth of all the varNAs
(aksharAs and letters) used in this sthuthi
2. Vakthru vailakshaNyam relating to the qualifications of the poet and
3. Vishaya LakshaNyam relating to the glory His subject.
All go together to enhance the sanctity of this sthOthram.
The divya desam is also connected with the three mudhal aazhwArs, who did a great service:
“poruL mihuttha maRai viLanga bhuviyOr uyya “poruL mihuttha maRai viLanga bhuviyOr uyya “poruL mihuttha maRai viLanga bhuviyOr uyya - - - - vandhu udhittha “. vandhu udhittha “. vandhu udhittha “.
The three AzhwArs as aadhi bhakthAs of the Lord described the real nature and attributes of the
Lord in easy to understand Tamil paasurams, which are the essence of the difficult-to-understand
Vedic rks. All of these go together to enhance the power and greatness of DehaLeesa sthuthi .
I offer my profound salutations to Sri VedAntha Desika for blessing me to write about this
extraordinary sthuthi on Sri DEhaLeesan .
