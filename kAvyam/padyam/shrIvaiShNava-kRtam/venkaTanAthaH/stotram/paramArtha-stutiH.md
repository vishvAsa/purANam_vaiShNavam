The valor of Lord Raamachandran is matchless. In DaNdakAraNyam, He destroyed 14,000 asurAs single handedly. He pulverized RaavaNA's army and finally RaavaNan Himself in a great battle. In AaraNya kANdam, our Lord's parAkramam is saluted as He destroyed Kharan, DhUshaNan, Thrisiras and the Moola Bhalam. Through His heroic acts, He destroyed the asurAs and made the lives of the Sages of DhaNdakAraNyam comfortable and free from fear. Swamy Desikan has saluted these valourous deeds in SrI Raghuveera Gadhyam's AaraNya and Yuddha KhANdams following the foot steps of Aadhi Kavi, Sage VaalmIki. Swamy Desikan's summation of the Lord's valor is housed in three salutations of SrI Raghuveera Gadhyam: AsahAya Soora! AnapAya Saahasa! Raagava Simha! In ParamArTa Sthuthi, Swamy Desikan continues celebrating the valor of the Lord of AyOdhyA and points out that He is the PaarijAtha tree at the banks of JatAyu PushkariNi (Grudhra Saras): 

SrImadh-grudhra-saras-theera PaarijAtham upAsmahE yathra Thungai: athungaisccha pranathai: gruhayathE Phalam 

At Thirupputtkkuzhi, the destroyer of RaavaNA and his clan gives His darsanam as Vijaya Raaghavn and is ready to grant all the boons that bhakthAs seek of Him just like a PaarijAtha tree in IndhrA's garden. 
7 On the banks of the JatAyu PushkariNi with its nourishing water is a mighty tree with sweet fruits. There the lowly (athungai :) and the mighty (thungai :) worship the Lord, perform SaraNAgathi and are treated equally with respect to the Phalans without consideration of their Jaathi-Kulam -GuNam and material possessions. That is indeed a miracle brought about by the PaarijAtha Tree (SrI Vijaya Raaghavan) of Thirupputtkuzhi. Swamy says that he meditates on that PaarijAtha tree (Srimathgrudhra-saras-theera paarijAtham upAsmahE). Both the lowly and the lofty prostrate before this Grudhra Saras theera PaarijAtham and becomes kruthArTaas.

After composing the first slOkam in anushtup metre, Swamy Desikan sets the rest of the 9 slOkams of SrI ParamArTa Sthuthi in lilting Oupacchandasikam meter.

Oh the Lord of Thirupputkkuzhi, who is celebrated for your valor in battles! Oh Vijaya RaaghavA! Our AchAryAs do not house anyone in their heart lotuses except “Bless me to Compose on You!” 9 you. They focus on you and you alone and shine as ParamaikAnthis (Thvadhanya Sarva-bhAvai :). They have trained me to be deeply immersed in the ocean of your anntha kalyANa guNams (Gurubhi: ThvadhIyE GuNa Sindhou krutha samplava: asmi) and adiyEn desires deeply to eulogize you (vanhdhi bhAvam icchan aham asmi). adiyEn has positioned myself to be the chief object of Your anugraham (Vandhi bhAvam icchan aham, tE yEkam anugraha aaspadham asmi). Swamy Desikan reminds the Lord of the Upadesams of his AchAryans about ananya bhakthi (avyapachAra Bhakthi) to the Lord to become qualified as a ParamaikAnthi. Then, Swamy Desikan states that he wants to go beyond the meditation about the Lord and engage in composing a Sthuthi about the Lord of Thirupputtkuzhi. He hints that his efforts to compose a sthuthi won’t bear fruit unless he is so blessed by the Grudhra-saras-theera PaarijAtham. Therefore, Swamy Desikan prays to the Lord to bless him to create a sthuthi on Him.

Swamy Desikan points out about two things here: (1) The entire assembly of ChEthnam and achEthanam adorn the Lord's ThirumEni as dhivya aabharanams and Dhivya aayudhams/weapons (BhuvanAsraya BhooshaNa-asthra vargam ThvadhIyam Vapu :). (2) SrI DEvi and BhU Devi and other consorts of His can not take their eyes off from such a beautiful ThirumEni. They do not close their eye lids for fear of missing even a fraction of second's enjoyment of His dhivya soundharyam (MahIshINAm animEsha darsaneeyam ThvadhIyam Vapu:). Swamy begs the Lord to grant him the boon as Grudhra-saras-thera PaarijAtham to make His manas become totally immersed in His beauty and anantha kalyANa guNams so that he can succeed in composing a Sthuthi befitting Him.

Oh Vijaya RaaghavA! PraNavam is made up of three Letters: A+U+M (akAra-ukAramakArams). The first letter is “A” (akAram denoting your Sarva Rakshakathvam “akAra – ukAra – makArams…..”(protecting one and all that perform SaraNAgathi to you). Swamy says: “Abhirakshithum PraNavE agratha: sTitham ThvAm”. Swamy goes on to point out where else He sat in front (agratha: sTithaam). He sat in front portion (the charioteer's seat) of the car (raTam) of Arjunan and performed GIthOpadesam) (PaarTa RaTE cha agratha: sTithAm ThvAm). Those who possess unimpeachable aathma guNams reflect on this important tatthvam and meditate on the meaning of PraNavam to banish their desire, anger et al. They recognize that you did not need to take weapons against the evil KouravAs. You won the victory over them by merely sitting in the front seat of the raTam. These superior souls comprehend your parAkramam to destroy your and Your BhagavathA's enemies by your sheer presence and eulogize you hence as asAdhAraNa RaNa Punghavan (Aahavapungavam kaTayanthi).

Swamy Desikan now shifts his attention to another aspect of SrI Vijaya Raaghavan: His performance of the SaraNAgathi Yaj~nam with His dharma pathni, SrI DEvi (SrI Maragathavali ThAyAr) under the shade of VijayakOti VimAnam at JatAyu KshEthram to protect PrapannAs:

Oh Vijaya RaaghavA! Your ThirunAmam, “RaNa Pungavan” has two meanings: (1) The greatest One in battles and (2) The greatest One in performing Yaj~nams. You perform a Yaagam with Your dharma PathnI, SrI Maragathavalli, who is never ever separated from You. In that Yaagam, Your kalyANa guNams like karuNai serve as the Rthviks (officiating priests). The name of Your Yaagam is “SaraNAgatha Rakshanam” (SrayathAm avanam aadhyam ahInam). That sanctimonious yaagam cannot be done by anyone other than you (Sa dharma cha Thvadh ananya sEvanIya:). AhInam is a Soma Yaagam that takes many days to perform. Swamy Desikan hints that this “SaraNAgatha Vrathi” continues to do this Yaagam of SaraNAgatha RakshaNam without interruption while accompanied by His PirAtti.

Oh Lord Vijaya RaaghavA! Oh the most celebrated (foremost) among Warriors (RaNa Pungava)! Those buddhisAlis (SudhiyA:) who recognize their unfitness to stand up to the rigors of practising Bhakthi yOgam feel importunate (krupaNA:)and perform SaraNAgathi at Your holy feet fully knowing that You are the ocean of Mercy and that You will protect them. They are clearly aware of Your KaruNai as Your primary help (KaruNA SahAyam) and perform SaraNAgathi as prapannAs (ThvAM SaraNam PrapannA :). 

They do not get distracted by any tatthvam except your anantha kalyANa guNams and SaraNAgatha rakshaNa Vratham (ananya BhAvA :) and perform prapatthi unto you.

Oh Lord of Thirupputtkkuzhi! Foremost among Your Vrathams is that of protecting those who perform SaraNAgathi at Your Thiruvadi. You are the SaraNAgatha RakshaNa DhIkshithan.

People of the world know very well your command to SugrIvan at Sehtukkarai (TE udhIritham bhuvanE vidhitham): Be it VibhIshaNan or RaavaNan himself bring them to Me. I will grant them abhayam. When you are known all over the world for this Vratham, adiyEn alone should not be abandoned by you in spite of my paapams. That won’t be consistent with your role as Sarva-lOka SaraNYan.

This delectable (RamaNIya) eulogy named ParamArTa sthuthi arose from the VenkatEsa Kavi of blemish free mind. This happened as a result of the grace of Thirupputtkkuzhi VijayarAgava PerumAn. The PrapannAs, who have performed SaraNAgati at the Thiruvadi of the Lord, get cleansed from the dhOshams such as Jealousy and intolerance. May Those PrapannAs free of dhOshams recite this sthuthi daily with sraddhA and gain the anugraham of SrI Maragathavalli SamEtha Sri Vijaya Raaghavan!
