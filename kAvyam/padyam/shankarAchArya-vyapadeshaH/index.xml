      <description>&lt;p&gt;॥ श्रीः  ॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;||विष्णुपादादिकेशान्तस्तोत्रम्||&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;English&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adi Sankaracharya, also reverentially called as Sankarabhagavatpada, has composed this exquisite hymn in praise of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu, with his bow Saarnga slinging over the shoulder holds in his four hands Panchajanya the conch, Sudarsana the disc, Nandaka the sword, and Koumodaki, the mace. He  has as his vehicle Garuda, the chief of the feathered race and as his seat Ananta, the chief of snakes. He has as his consorts  Sridevi and Bhudevi. After praying to Vishnu’s weapons, his vehicle, his seat and his consorts Sri Sankara prays to each of the parts of Vishnu’s divine form starting from his feet [paadaadi] and ending in the hair[keSaanta] on his head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
