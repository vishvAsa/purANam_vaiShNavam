  <h2 id="śaunaka-said"><em>Śaunaka said</em>:</h2>
<p>1-3. Now I desire to hear, O you who were actually instructed by Veda Vyāsa, of the nature of Viṣṇu. O you who have no pride, O you who favour the world, tell me properly as to how (i. e. by doing what) a sinful and very miserable woman would be fortunate. By (doing) what would she be dear to her husband, would she be beautiful, and nectar to (his) eyes? O you, rich in penance, tell me by which (means) wealth is produced.</p>
<h2 id="sūta-said"><em>Sūta said</em>:</h2>
<p>4. O brāhmaṇa, if (you think) this is a meritorious account, difficult to be had, (then) listen. I shall tell it to you briefly and properly.</p>
<p>5-13. In the yuga called Dvāpara, there was a king by name Bhadraśravas. He was a resident of the Saurāṣṭra country and had mastered the Vedas and the Vedāṅgas. He had a wife by name Suratacandrikā. From her the king got seven attractive sons. Then a beautiful and truthful daughter, Śyāmābālā by name was born. She delighted her father. Once Śyāmābālā went joyfully with her friends to the ground under a nīpa tree, very difficult to be met with, in the golden sands to play with attractive gems (to be) concealed (and then to be discovered). In the meanwhile, O brāhmaṇa, Lakṣmī, rescuing people from the worldly existence and giving (i.e. teaching) them the right course and having taken the form of an old brāhmaṇa lady, herself came (there); and O brāhmaṇa, thinking in her mind (i.e. to herself), ‘Barring the house of the king, the ruler of all the people, to the house of which mean people should I go now?’ she went to the king’s abode which had golden walls and which was adorned with banners. Then having crossed the main gate, she said to the door-keeper: “O you of auspicious characteristics who are appointed at the door, leave it (and report to the queen). I am quickly going and seeing queen Suratacandrikā”.</p>
<p>14. Hearing those words of her, uttered like the note of a cuckoo, (the doorkeeper) holding a golden staff in her hand, was extremely delighted.</p>
<h2 id="the-doorkeeper-said"><em>The doorkeeper said</em>:</h2>
<p>15. O old lady, what is your name? Who is your husband? How have you come (here)? What is your business in seeing (i.e. with) the queen? For what reason (do you want to see her)? What (is your intention), O brāhmaṇa lady? I have curiosi ty to hear it.</p>
<h2 id="the-old-lady-said"><em>The old lady said</em>:</h2>
<p>16-18a. Listen, O you (queen’s) employee, O you who hold a jewelled staff (i.e. you who are the doorkeeper) of the great king’s wife, since you have curiosity for (i.e. to know) the reason for my arrival, I am (that) well-known (goddess) named Kamalā, and the lord of the worlds is known as the lord of my life. (My) city is Dvāravatī by name. O employee, the lord of my life lives in that (city). O you having a jewelled staff in your hand, listen with curiosity. I have come from there. Now, to you, I shall tell the reason for my arrival.</p>
<p>18b-26. Formerly (i.e. in a former existence), your queen, born in a vaiśya family, was unhappy. One day, O employee, that unhappy lady quarrelled with her husband, and then tormented by her husband, she, weeping repeatedly, immediately went out of the house. Hearing her weeping, I approached her. I asked her all (her) account, and was properly told. Then I taught her the excellent vow. On my having taught the vow to her, she gladly practised the vow. O you doorkeeper, due to its propitiousness she became happy. Once she, born in a vaiśya family, died with her husband. Then lord Dharmarāja, who brings about the destruction of all, sent his fearful servants to bring the two (to his abode). The fierce messengers came (there) by Yama’s order. They, with iron hammers in their hands exerted to go to Yama’s abode.</p>
<p>27-31. In the meanwhile, those messengers of Lakṣmī, who were Viṣṇu’s devotees, and who had held conches, discs and maces, came (there) to take them (to her abode). Seeing them like that, Yama’s messengers fled (away). (Then) the magnanimous, self-radiant messengers of Lakṣmī cut off the nooses and having put them in a chariot to which royal swans were yoked, they all suddenly went along the aerial path to Lakṣmī’s city. For so many thousands of kalpas the two lived in Lakṣmī’s city, as many times the excellent vow was practised by the vaiśya lady. To enjoy the remaining religious merit, the two are now born in a royal family. O you doorkeeper, the two, proud of the royal glory, have forgotten the vow. Therefore, to advise her and you also about the vow I have come (here).</p>
<h2 id="the-doorkeeper-said-1"><em>The doorkeeper said</em>:</h2>
<p>32-33a. O old lady, in what manner is the vow practised? Practised in which month is the vow the best? Which is the deity that is worshipped? O mother, tell properly this to me who am asking you.</p>
<h2 id="kamalā-ie-lakṣmī-said"><em>Kamalā (i.e. Lakṣmī) said</em>:</h2>
<p>33b-43a. O employee (i.e. O doorkeeper), when the month of Kārtika has passed and the month of Mārgaśīrṣa has arrived, in that month, on a day called Thursday, in the morning, a woman surrounded by those who practise the vow, should worship Lakṣmī along with Nārāyaṇa. O you employee, she should propitiate Lakṣmī with sweets (mixed) with sweetened milk, and (articles of) food mixed with candied sugar, and then should pray like this: “O Kamalā (i.e. Lakṣmī), you who are worshipped by the worlds and you who are dear to Viṣṇu; as you are unshakingly (devoted) to Kṛṣṇa (i.e.Viṣṇu), in the same way remain (firmly) in me. O goddess Lakṣmī, you who rule (everything), O sinless one, give me shelter.” Assuring Lakṣmī with many presents, she should please her. She should worship the goddess with great festivity by reciting sacred texts. O employee, then giving the remains of the articles of food to the deity, to the best brāhmaṇa, she should (distribute it among) herself, her husband, sons and other servants. O beautiful lady, listen to the speciality of the second Thursday: She should propitiate Lakṣmī with auspicious fried articles of wheat baked in earthen pots and variegated powders. She should devoutly (worship) Lakṣmī. On the third (Thursday) she should offer present of boiled rice mixed with candied sugar. On the fourth (Thursday) she should carefully and joyfully worship goddess Lakṣmī with excellent śyāmāka and śāli (rice), O you having a jewelled staff in your hand. Then to please goddess Lakṣmī, she should please brāhmaṇas with (i.e. by giving them) money, cloth, ornaments, various articles of food and fruits.</p>
<h2 id="the-doorkeeper-said-2"><em>The doorkeeper said</em>:</h2>
<p>43b-47a. O old lady, stay here only; informing the queen (of your arrival) I shall take you (to her). O best one, do not be angry.</p>
<p>Saying so, that beautiful lady went to the queen. O brāhmaṇa, that doorkeeper, having put her joined palms on her head told all that Lakṣmī had said from the beginning to the end to queen Suratacandrikā. Having heard the words of the doorkeeper queen Suratacandrikā went near the brāhmaṇa lady, and the beautiful lady proudly spoke to her.</p>
<h2 id="the-queen-said"><em>The</em> <em>queen said</em>:</h2>
<p>47b-48a. O old brāhmaṇa lady, to advise what have you come here? Tell it to me quickly, as you please and giving up fear.</p>
<h2 id="the-brāhmaṇa-lady-said"><em>The brāhmaṇa lady said</em>:</h2>
<p>48b-50a. Seeing your immorality I desire to go quickly. O wicked one, what shall I tell you, since today, on the day of (i.e. sacred to) Lakṣmī, O you cāṇḍālā, you are not observing that vow very difficult to have? I have seen that. Now, O proud one, who will (live) in your house?</p>
<p>50b-52. Hearing these words of the brāhmaṇa lady, she (i.e. the queen) with her eyes red with anger struck the old brāhmaṇa lady. Then that old Kamalā (i.e. Lakṣmī) ran away crying. Then that girl Śyāmā, having penance as her wealth, who was playing, came near that brāhmaṇa lady on hearing her weeping.</p>
<h2 id="śyāmābālā-said"><em>Śyāmābālā said</em>:</h2>
<p>53-61. O old lady, tell me who caused you pain like this.</p>
<p>O best of brāhmaṇas, having heard her words, Kamalā, with her voice faltering due to grief, told her the entire account. Śyāmābālā, having heard from her that vow extremely difficult to have, practised it, as told in the sacred texts, with faith and devotion. When the first three days (i.e. Thursdays) were over, and the fourth (Thursday) arrived, her marriage rite was accomplished by the grace of Lakṣmī. The son named Mālādhara, of king Śrīsiddheśvara, having royal lustre, took her and went home. O brāhmaṇa, listen to the wonder (that took place) when she had gone. O brāhmaṇa, it was not known who had taken away the very many rich articles that were there in the house of the queen. She sat without wealth, without ideas and without food and clothes; and to ask (her daughter) for something, she sent her husband with someone to her daughter’s house. O brāhmaṇa, after some time he went with difficulty to the village of that Mālādhara, and reached the bank of a lake. Her maids had come there to take water from that (lake). Seeing him who was most unhappy, they, sympathising with him, said (to him).</p>
<h2 id="the-maids-said"><em>The maids said</em>:</h2>
<p>62. Tell us all that—who you who have lost flesh and blood, whose body and hair are rough, are; wherefrom you have come.</p>
<h2 id="the-poor-man-said"><em>The poor man said</em>:</h2>
<p>63-67. I am Śyāmābālā’s father. I have come from Saurāṣṭra city. O maids, tell this to Śyāmābālā.</p>
<p>Hearing those words of (i.e. uttered by) him, they who were full of curiosity, laughed after looking at one another’s face, and went to their city; and O brāhmaṇa, they told the entire account to Śyāmābālā. Hearing their words, she sent her servants. The beautiful lady gave her father flowers, oil, divine garments, sandal, betel-leaf and a horse. All the servants also went (to him) and having made him well-dressed, took him to Śyāmābālā’s house, resembling a palace.</p>
<p>68-71. Then Śyāmābālā also carefully fed her father who was most unhappy, with food of śāli (i.e. boiled rice) with ghee. When four days had passed, she gave him money concealed in a vessel, and sent him (back), O you whose wealth is your penance. Then after entering his house, he found that the money that was there in the vessel (had turned into) a heap of charcoals, and being extremely unhappy he wept. He who had come (back) to his (own) house, went out of it to go to his daughter’s house. She also went to the bank of that lake.</p>
<p>72-80. The chaste lady (i.e. Śyāmābālā) honoured her who was dearer to her than her own life, in the same way through affection for her mother. At this time Śyāmābālā thought of making her mother observe (the vow of) the excellent day of Lakṣmī. Her mother, having incurred the wrath of Lakṣmī, experienced poverty, and secretly ate what was left over by young ones of animals. Three days sacred to Lakṣmī passed, and on the fourth one she (i.e. Śyāmābālā) firmly made her observe (that vow). That queen Suratacandrikā came (back) to her city. She saw her house divine like that (i.e. as before) by the grace of Lakṣmī. O best of brāhmaṇas, Śyāmābālā on some occasion again went to the house of her mother with a desire to see her glory. Seeing Śyāmābālā from a distance, she became angry; and saying, “I shall not see her face”, she remained hidden. Going into the interior of the house, and taking salt (from there), she (i.e. Śyāmābālā) quietly came to her house resorted to by Lakṣmī. The king, her lord, asked the chaste lady whose husband was her god: “O dear one, tell me what you have brought.”</p>
<h2 id="the-wife-said"><em>The wife</em> <em>said</em>:</h2>
<p>81-84. I have brought the essence of the kingdom; I shall show it to you at (the time of) the meal.</p>
<p>Saying so she cooked food without salt and gave food etc. to king Mālādhara. Then king Mālādhara eating the seasoned article without salt, became sad. Then she gave him (the salt) the essence of the kingdom. O brāhmaṇa, then the king’s mind was pleased and he took his meal. And (repeatedly) saying, ‘(You are) blessed, (you are) blessed,’ he praised the woman. One who does not observe this vow with great respect would become poor and luckless in existence after existence.</p>
<p>85-86. He who would listen to this with devotion, or would recite it attentively, would be freed from all sins, and would obtain (i.e. go to) Lakṣmī’s world. There is no doubt that for her who observes this vow without listening to its story, the fruit of the vow is lost.</p>
