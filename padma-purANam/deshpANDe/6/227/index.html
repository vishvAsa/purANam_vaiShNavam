  <h2 id="śaṅkara-said"><em>Śaṅkara said</em>:</h2>
<p>1-6. Rāma enjoyed with Sītā royal pleasures as desired while protecting directions on all sides for a thousand years. All inmates of the harem, so also the citizens, censured Sītā who had stayed in the demon’s house. Rāma who warded off his enemies, through fear of public scandal, and exhibiting human behaviour, abandoned the princess (Sītā) who was pregnant, in the assembly of sages in Vālmīki’s holy hermitage in a large forest on the bank of Gaṅgā. Dependent upon her husband she stayed in the sage’s house. Taken care of by the sage Vālmīki, she was honoured by sages’ wives. There only she gave birth to twin sons named Kuśa and Lava. Educated and trained by the sage they grew there only.</p>
<p>7-13a. Rāma too, along with his brothers, protected the earth. He, the king, endowed with virtues like restraint, and free from all enjoyments, always worshipping Viṣṇu having no beginning or end, and highly devoted to celibacy, ruled over the earth. Śatrughna, the righteous descendant of Raghu, having killed Lavaṇa, ruled, along with his two sons, over Mathura created by gods. Bharata, having killed gandharvas on both the sides of Sindhu, installed his two very mighty sons in that country. The very powerful Lakṣmaṇa, having killed the Madras in the western Madra country, consecrated his two brave sons, and again going back to Ayodhyā, touched Rāma’s feet. (Rāma,) the descendant of Kakutstha brought back to life the son of a brāhmaṇa that had met death, and then killed a śūdra ascetic.</p>
<p>13b-17. Then Rāma, the killer of his enemy’s heroes performed a horse-sacrifice in the Naimiṣa (forest) in the assembly of people on the bank of Gautamī. Rāghava, knowing the highest truth, fashioned a golden (image of) Jānakī, and with that the very mighty one performed many sacrifices. The lord performed various sacrifices, complete with presents, like myriads of horse-sacrifices, Vājapeya sacrifices, Agniṣṭoma, Viśvajit, Gomedha and Śatakratu. In the meanwhile, Vālmīki of a very great (i.e. severe) penance (to his credit) brought Sītā there, and said these words to Rāma:</p>
<h2 id="vālmīki-said"><em>Vālmīki said</em>:</h2>
<p>18. O you of a good vow, you do not deserve to abandon (i.e. please do not abandon) sinless Sītā. This chaste one is free from passion and is like light to the sun. O descendant of Kakutstha, she is identical with you. O sinless one, why did you abandon her?</p>
<h2 id="rāma-said"><em>Rāma said</em>:</h2>
<p>19-22. O brāhmaṇa, from your words I understand that Sītā is sinless. The chaste lady was former]y kidnapped by Rāvaṇa in the secluded Daṇḍaka (forest). Having killed him in battle, and having properly taken Sītā who was purified and who came out of Agni’s mouth, I came to Ayodhyā (again). There was a great public scandal among the citizens. Being afraid of it I abandoned her of a good conduct, near you. Therefore, for satisfying the people, Sītā who is highly devoted to me, must convince the kings and great sages (of her innocence).</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>23-24. Thus addressed the chaste Sītā put forward a proof amazing the people in the assembly of sages and kings. Showing those people her sole devotion to Rāma, the chaste Sītā, with the palms of her hands folded, said in the assembly of all (people):</p>
<h2 id="sītā-said"><em>Sītā said</em>:</h2>
<p>25-26. Since I have not thought of anyone except Rāma, may goddess Earth give me a cavity. Since I spoke the truth that I do not know anyone else but Rāma, Dharaṇī (i.e. the Earth) would at once come to her daughter Vaidehī.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-1"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>27-32. Then the lord of birds, the hero, knowing the mother (had come) from below the earth, held a seat full of jewels. Then goddess Dharaṇī, holding Sītā with both her hands, greeted her with a welcome, and seated her on the seat. Seeing her seated on the seat, the hosts of gods in heaven profusely and continuously scattered a shower of flowers on divine Sītā. She too, the ancient one, being honoured by divine damsels mounted on Garuḍa, and went to heaven by that path. On her front the goddess of the world was surrounded by hosts of maids. She reached the highest ancient abode, accessible to the meditating saints. Seeing her entering the lower world, all men shouted loudly: “Well (done), well (done), This is Sītā.”</p>
<p>33-36. Rāma, overcome by grief, took both his sons and along with sages and best kings entered Sāketa. Then after a long time, (Rāma’s) mothers who had fulfilled their vows, died and went to the heaven of their husband (i.e. to the heaven where Daśaratha had gone). Rāma who had fulfilled his vows righteously, ruled over the kingdom for ten thousand and ten hundred years. Sometime the god of death came to Rama’s abode in the guise of an ascetic and spoke (these) words:</p>
<h2 id="death-kāla-said"><em>Death (Kāla) said</em>:</h2>
<p>37-38. O Rāma, Rāma, O you of large arms, I am sent by the Creator. O best of Raghus, O very intelligent one, listen to what I say. We shall carry on a conversation (lit. wordy duel). He who enters in between (i.e. disturbs us) will merit death.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-2"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>39. Promising him with the words “All right” the lotuseyed Rāma placed Lakṣmaṇa at the door. Then Death spoke (these) words: Yama (Death) spoke to Rāma, Daśaratha’s son:</p>
<h2 id="kāla-death-said"><em>Kāla (Death) said</em>:</h2>
<p>40-42. O Rāma, listen to what led to my arrival. You descended on the mortal world, saying, after having killed the two best demons: “I would live in the mortal world for ten thousand and ten hundred years.” Thus (also) told by the hosts of gods (you have stayed for that much period). Now the time for you to go (back) to heaven has come. O sinless one, let the gods today have the lord in you.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-3"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>43. To the great sage Rāma said, “Let it be so”. In the meanwhile the great ascetic Durvāsas came to the gate of the royal palace and spoke (these) words to Lakṣmaṇa:</p>
<h2 id="durvāsas-said"><em>Durvāsas said</em>:</h2>
<p>44. O prince, O descendant of Kakutstha, go quickly and report to Rāma (about the arrival of) me.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-4"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>45. To him Lakṣmaṇa said: “O brāhmaṇa, (Rāma has ordered that) no person should be allowed near (him).” Then the best sage overcome by anger said:</p>
<h2 id="durvāsas-said-1"><em>Durvāsas said</em>:</h2>
<p>46a. I shall pronounce a curse if you do not present me to Rāma, the descendant of Kakutstha.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-5"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>46b-53. Due to the fear of the curse (Lakṣmaṇa) reported to Rāma (the arrival of) the sage. There only Death causing fear to all beings vanished. The king worshipped sage Durvāsas that had come (there). That best Raghu, Lakṣmaṇa, knowing that promise of his elder brother, gave up his human form in the water of Sarayū. Giving up the human form he entered his own body. He having a thousand hoods, and having a lustre of a crore of moons, having divine flowers and garments, smeared with divine sandal, surrounded by thousands of serpent-damsels, well-adorned, having got into a divine aeroplane, went to the abode of Viṣṇu. The best Raghu Kākutstha (i.e. Rāma) knowing Lakṣmaṇa’s going to heaven, also desired to go to heaven. Then Rāma, having consecrated his sons Kuśa and Lava, having divided wealth along with chariots, elephants and horses gave it to them. The best of Raghus installed righteously on his kingdom (i.e. throne) Kuśa at Kuśavatī and Lava at Śarasvatī.</p>
<p>54-58. Knowing the intention of Rāma who had realised his soul all the very powerful monkeys and demons came there. (They were) Bibhīṣaṇa, Sugrīva, Jāmbavat, (Māruti) the Wind’s son, Nīla, Nala, Suṣeṇa, and Guha, the lord of the Niṣādas. Śatrughna also consecrated his brave sons as kings, and all of them came to Ayodhyā protected by Rama. Having saluted the noble one, with their palms joined they said to him:</p>
<h2 id="the-monkeys-and-others-said"><em>The monkeys and others said</em>:</h2>
<p>O best of the Raghus, having come to know that you are ready to go to heaven, we have come (here) to follow you. O lord, O Rāma, we cannot live without you (even) for a moment. Therefore, O large-eyed one, with you we shall go to the abode of gods.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-6"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>59. Thus addressed by them the descendant of Kakutstha said: “All right.” Then the very lustrous one said to Bibhīṣaṇa, the lord of demons:</p>
<h2 id="rāma-said-1"><em>Rāma said</em>:</h2>
<p>60. Rule over your kingdom righteously. Do not falsify your promise. Being well pleased enjoy as long as the moon, the sun and the earth remain. Then at the (proper) time come to my place.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-7"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>61-62. Speaking like this the lotus-eyed Rāma affectionately gave to him his ancient (image of) Viṣṇu, gentle and lying (on Śeṣa) and the family deity of the Ikṣvākus.To Hanūmat Rama. the killer of his enemies, said:</p>
<h2 id="rāma-said-2"><em>Rāma said</em>:</h2>
<p>63. O lord of monkeys, as long as my stories go on (being narrated) on the earth, remain on the earth. At the (proper) time. O you of a good vow, go to me..</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-8"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>64a. Speaking like this to him, Rāma said to Jāmbavat:</p>
<h2 id="rāma-said-3"><em>Rāma said</em>:</h2>
<p>64b-65. When Dvāpara (age) will come, I shall again be born on the earth in the family of Yadus for destroying the burden of the earth. O best of bears, I shall (then) fight with you.</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-9"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>66-72. The very powerful Rāma, the descendant of Kakutstha, having thus spoken to him, said to all the bears and monkeys (these words): “(Please) go.” Ministers, traders, Bharata, the son of Kaikayī, determined to follow Rāma, came (there). Then the celibate, wearing white garments, went to the Supreme Spirit. Holding kuśas in his hands the restrained one went to the Supreme Spirit. To Rāma’s right side was Ramā (i.e. Lakṣmī) with a lotus in her hand. Similarly to the side other than the right (i.e. to the left side) was goddess Dharaṇī (i.e. the earth). O Pārvatī, in the same way Vedas with the Vedāṅgas, Purāṇas with Itihāsas, Oṃkāra, Vaṣaṭkāra, so also Sāvitrī purifying the world, followed Rāma. Missiles, weapons like bows etc., all having male bodies followed Rāma. Bharata and Śatrughna, so also all citizens with their sons, wives and attendants went after Rāma.</p>
<p>73-78. Ministers, hosts of attendants, servants, traders, so also monkeys, bears along with Sugrīva and with their sons, wives went after the very intelligent descendant of Kakutstha. Beasts and birds, so also all immobile and mobile objects went after the noble one. So also the best men who saw the descendant of Kakutstha going to heaven. They who thus followed Rāma, did not return. Then having gone over three yojanas he saw Sarayū on the western side. With his followers he entered Sarayū of auspicious water. Then Brahmā, the grandsire, surrounded by hosts of all gods, and along with sages praised the best among Raghus with (suitable) words. He said to Rāma who had entered the water of the Sarayū (river):</p>
<h2 id="brahmā-said"><em>Brahmā said</em>:</h2>
<p>79-81. O Viṣṇu, come, prosperity to you. O you who honour (others), you have luckily come (here). With your brothers, lustrous like gods, enter your own body of Viṣṇu, which is very bright, divine and ancient. O god, you are the refuge of the world; only few do not take cognizance of you who are inconceivable, noble, immutable, and comprising everything. O you of great lustre, enter that body which you desire (to enter).</p>
<h2 id="maheśvara-said-10"><em>Maheśvara said</em>:</h2>
<p>82-91. When he was full of the sun’s rays, and when showers of flowers were dropped on him, he abandoned the human form and entered his own body. Both the noble Śatrughna and Bharata, endowed with divine lustre, were with him with the conch and the disc, his portions. He, the four-armed one, who had a conch, a disc, a mace, and the Śārṅga (bow) in his hands, who was possessed of divine ornaments, who had (his body) smeared with divine sandal, who had worn divine yellow garments, whose eyes were like lotus-leaves, who was a youth, whose-body was handsome, who was bright with delicate parts, whose hair was very glossy, dark and curly, who had auspicious marks, who was dark like fresh dūrvā-sprouts, whose face resembled the full moon, got along with the two goddesses into an aeroplane, and he, the lord, of a great lustre, praised by all gods, sat on the divine throne at the root of the desire-yielding tree. Those bears, monkeys and men, just on touching the water of Sarayū, happily cast their life. Due to Rama’s grace all they were handsome and had divine forms. They had worn divine flowers and garments; they had divine, auspicious lustre. There were innumerable men. Śrī Rāma, having lotus-like eyes, surrounded by all, worshipped by hosts of gods and siddhas, praised by all gods, got into the aeroplane.</p>
<p>92-95. The lord came to his own eternal, divine, imperishable place. O you of a beautiful appearance, one who would recite the (full) account of Rāma, or would listen to a verse or half a verse or would devoutly remember it, would, being free from sins committed knowingly or unknowingly during crores of existences, reach, along with his sons and wife, without any effort, Viṣṇu’s world, to be reached (only) through abstract meditation. O goddess, I have narrated to you this great account of Rāma. Due to the narration (of the account) of Rāma, I am blessed along with you, O goddess. O you of an excellent face, what else do you desire to know? I shall narrate all that.</p>
