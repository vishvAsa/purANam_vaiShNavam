The highest position is not had by means of a formula not sacred to Viṣṇu. If the former couple of sacred names (i.e. the one mentioned above) is imparted by one who is a non-Vaiṣṇava, then one should again receive it from a follower of Viṣṇu. Even if a man has studied a thousand branches (of the holy texts), even if he was initiated into all (kinds of) sacrifices, even if he is born in a good family, he should not be a preceptor if he is not a follower of Viṣṇu. That follower of Viṣṇu who properly imparts the two sacred names, should be known as the preceptor, tearing off the bond of the mundane existence. A brāhmaṇa should, after resorting to a preceptor, live (with him) for a year. The preceptor, knowing his behaviour, should impart him the formula.">

  <h2 id="śaṅkara-said"><em>Śaṅkara said</em>:</h2>
<p>1-5. At (the time of) a nyāsa or worship, one should resort to Viṣṇu’s formula (mantra). The highest position is not had by means of a formula not sacred to Viṣṇu. If the former couple of sacred names (i.e. the one mentioned above) is imparted by one who is a non-Vaiṣṇava, then one should again receive it from a follower of Viṣṇu. Even if a man has studied a thousand branches (of the holy texts), even if he was initiated into all (kinds of) sacrifices, even if he is born in a good family, he should not be a preceptor if he is not a follower of Viṣṇu. That follower of Viṣṇu who properly imparts the two sacred names, should be known as the preceptor, tearing off the bond of the mundane existence. A brāhmaṇa should, after resorting to a preceptor, live (with him) for a year. The preceptor, knowing his behaviour, should impart him the formula.</p>
<p>6-9. Having first done the sacraments as burning his body (i.e. putting sectarian marks on it), he should then utter the formula, after burning, putting the sectarian mark and giving a name (to him). Then he should teach his disciple of a pure heart. The rite of burning with (i.e. putting marks like) the (heated) disc (etc.) is called tapa (or burning). The sectarian mark is said to be vertical and the name (accepted by) the Vaiṣṇava sect is pronounced. Then in accordance with the rule (about the mantra) the teacher should teach the formula to the disciple. (He should teach him) nyāsa, the eight-syllabled or any other formula sacred to Viṣṇu. O you of an auspicious face, here nyāsa is of a high value to the followers of Viṣṇu.</p>
<p>10-12. Therefore, for them nyāsa is said to be superior. A brāhmaṇa highly devoted to nyāsa is said to be the best. There is no greater mantra than a nyāsa. I am telling you the truth. Nyāsa and the couple of mantras are synonyms for devotion. Learn it from me. After having instruction in the two, he should practise all rites. He who is not entitled to both does not deserve to perform all rites.</p>
<p>13-16. Therefore, the best brāhmaṇa, having studied the two, should study the eight-syllabled formula properly. The formula is said to be eight-syllabled due to the inclusion of (the syllable) Om. The wise say that that is a sacred formula which naturally has Om at its beginning. Except at the beginning of all formulas Om is not naturally there. One should use it before (i.e. at the beginning of) all formulas. O you of an auspicious face, the sacred syllable Om is Brahman. It is the chief of all formulas. One should use it at the commencement of all formulas.</p>
<p>17-21. At the root-formula Om is naturally settled. The first (syllable) is Om, having one letter. Then is (the word) <em>namaḥ</em> having two letters. Then in proper order are the five letters Nārāyaṇāya. Thus the formula, accomplishing all objects, should be known to be eight-syllabled. It removes all sorrows; it is glorious; it contains all formulas; it is auspicious. Its seer is Nārāyaṇa, and (he) himself, the lord of Śrī, is its deity. Its metre is the divine Gāyatrī and origin is Om. The power of the formula is goddess Śrī who is never-failing. The first foot is said to be the letter <em>Om</em>; the second to be <em>Namaḥ</em>, and the third to be Nārāyaṇāya. Thus the three feet are told.</p>
<p>22-26. The letters <em>a</em>, <em>u</em>, and <em>m</em> form the syllable <em>Om</em>, which is Brahman’s word, and is of the nature of the three Vedas. Viṣṇu is expressed by the letter a, Śrī by the letter <em>u</em>; the letter <em>m</em> is the servant of these two, and is said to be the twenty-fifth (letter). It is said by the wise that <em>a</em> expresses Viṣṇu’s form. The sages say that <em>u</em> expresses the form of the goddess Śrī. The letter <em>m</em> expresses the soul, the puruṣa, the twenty-fifth (principle of the Sāṃkhyas). The elements are expressed by the class of letters beginning with <em>ka</em>; and the senses are denoted by the class of letters beginning with <em>ca</em>. The class of letters beginning with <em>ṭa</em> and that beginning with <em>ta</em> denote knowledge, so also the letters like <em>dha</em> (indicate the same). The mind is expressed by the letter <em>pa</em> only; and ego by the letter <em>pha</em>.</p>
<p>27-30. Mahat (i.e. Intellect) and Prakṛti (Primordial Matter) (the principles enunciated in the Sāṃkhya System) are (respectively) expressed by the letters <em>ba</em> and <em>bha</em>. The soul is said to be the letter <em>ma</em> and is said to be the twenty-fifth (principle). It is different from the body, the senses, the mind, the vital breath; and has no other means. He is the remnant of the lord, is denoted by <em>ma</em> and is sentient. Some say that <em>ma</em> indicates just the emphasis. According to them the principle of Śrī is expressed by the letter <em>va</em> (<em>ma</em>?) only. As the sun’s lustre does not go away from him, so Lakṣmī does not go away from him. Viṣṇu, the ocean of auspicious qualities, is expressed by the letter <em>ā</em>.</p>
<p>31-36. The lord of Śrī is the remnant of all souls, is the seed (i.e. source) of the world, and the highest person. He is the author and the sustainer of the world, the lord, and people’s kin. (Lakṣmī) always controls the worlds, does not go away from Viṣṇu. She is mother of the entire world and Viṣṇu’s charming wife. Here (i.e. in the mantra) the letter <em>u</em> expresses Śrī, who is the support of the world. The wise say that the letter <em>ma</em> expresses the soul, the servant of the two (i.e. Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī). He is the support of knowledge, has knowledge as his quality, is sentient, and is beyond Prakṛti. He is not insentient; he is without any modification; is uniform in nature and has (no other form than) his own form. He is subtle, eternal, pervading, of the nature of intellect and joy, is of the nature of ego, immutable, the soul, of different forms, and eternal. He cannot be burnt, cannot be cut off, cannot be made wet, cannot be dried, and is indestructible; he is (thus) endowed with such qualities and is an effect of the highest (soul).</p>
<p>37-42. The letter <em>ma</em> expresses the individual soul, always dependent. He is the servant of Viṣṇu only and of none else. Thus is determined his servitude to be mediocre. O sinless one, the meaning of <em>Om</em> should be known like this. I have explained it (to you). O auspicious one, the exposition of <em>Om</em> (is done) by means of the remnant of the meaning, the formula(?). In this world, he who is the servant of another, does not get freedom. Therefore, with (the help of) the mind one should turn away Mahat and Ahaṃkāra (i.e. Intellect and Ego). That act which is done by the knowledge of one’s means, is also prohibited. The letter <em>ma</em> is (i.e. stands for) ego, and the letter <em>na</em> prohibits it. Therefore, with his mind only he gets freedom from the ego. Every accomplishment is due to the mind. Otherwise he would perish. Whatever is with the mind is said to be the ego.</p>
<p>43-46. One having egotism has absolutely no happiness. He whose mind is deluded by egotism sinks in the blinding darkness. Therefore, his freedom through mind is not prohibited. He is dependent upon the lord and lives under his influence. Therefore, the sentient is not the author of the means. The mobile and the immobile exist due to the will of the highest lord. Therefore, he would completely give up the application of his own power. Due to the lord’s power there is nothing that is not obtained by him.</p>
<p>47-53. Having placed the burden (i.e. the responsibility) on that lord of Lakṣmī, he should do acts of (i.e. sacred to) him only. The highest soul, Viṣṇu, is the master. I always belong to him. His mind should be employed according to the desire of that lord only. Thus it is noble when egotism and sense of mineness are abandoned by the mind. In the mundane existence the sense of mineness is the root of the bondage due to the deeds. Therefore, a wise man should avoid Mahat (Intellect) and Ahaṃkāra (ego) with (the help of) the mind. (Now) O you auspicious Girijā, I shall explain (to you) the word <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. <em>Nārā</em> is the assemblage of the souls. This Puruṣa (Nārāyaṇa) is their refuge. And they are his abode; therefore he is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. The entire world—the sentient and insentient objects—is heard, is seen. He, who always remains after pervading it, is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. The groups of all men are said to be <em>Nārā</em>. He is their refuge and support. Therefore, he is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. The wise know the principles produced from <em>Nara</em> (i.e. the Supreme Spirit) as <em>nārā</em>.</p>
<p>54-59. They alone are his abode. Therefore, he is called Nārāyaṇa, by whom the world, after devouring it even at the end of the kalpa, is supported, and by whom it is again created. Therefore he is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. The entire world consisting of the mobile and the immobile is called <em>Nāra</em>. To it he is connected; therefore he is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. The <em>Nāra</em>—the host of men—is his abode or refuge. Therefore, he is always called <em>Nārāyaṇa</em> by the sages; from him spring the worlds, as the massive foam in the ocean. Since they again merge into him, therefore, he is said to be <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. He is (residing) at the eternal position, is eternal, and is always free and alone enjoys; he is the lord of the entire world. Therefore, he is called <em>Nārāyaṇa</em>. <em>Nārāyaṇa</em> is the highest Brahman. <em>Nārāyaṇa</em> is the highest principle.</p>
<p>60-64. <em>Nārāyaṇa</em> has remained after pervading whatever is seen or heard within and without this world. Hari, Nārāyaṇa, Acyuta is the Supreme soul with the sins destroyed. He resides within all beings. He is divine, always (all) alone, and is eternal. He is the seer and is what is to be seen. He is the listener and is what is listened to also. He is the one that touches and is also what is touched. He meditates and is what is meditated upon. He is the speaker and what is spoken. He is the knower and what is known. He is the sentient and insentient world. All that is said to be Hari, the lord of Śrī, Nārāyaṇa. He, the Supreme Being, has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet. Having pervaded all the worlds he stands above them by (the measure of) ten fingers.</p>
<p>65-69. All that was and will be is Nārāyaṇa Hari. And he is the lord of immortality and the Virāṭ; the Supreme Being (grows beyond) by the means of food. He alone is the Supreme Being, Viṣṇu, Vāsudeva, Acyuta, Hari, Hiraṇmāya, and the lord; he is immortal, eternal, auspicious (Śiva). He is the master of the entire world, is the lord of all people, and the master. He is Hiraṇyagarbha, the Sun, is Ananta (the endless) and the great god. The word <em>Bhagavat</em>, so also the word <em>Puruṣa</em> and the word <em>Nirupādhi</em> stand for Vāsudeva, the soul of all. The god, the lord Viṣṇu, the highest soul, the friend of the world, the only ruler of the movable and the immovable is the greatest refuge of the ascetics.</p>
<p>70-73. That one who is naturally merged into the sound uttered at the beginning of the Veda and who is settled in the Vedānta (i.e. the Upaniṣads), who is the greatest, is the great god. That one, viz. Viṣṇu, who is (indicated by) the letter a, the one who is Nārāyaṇa Hari, is the eternal Supreme Being, the highest soul, the great lord. Sages use the word <em>Īśvara</em> (i.e. the lord) also for him in whom wonderful glory exists. Unconditional lordship exists in Viṣṇu. The ancient words of Veda have described him as the soul, the lord. Therefore, in Vāsudeva the great lordship exists.</p>
<p>74-88. Due to his splendour he is <em>Tripād</em> (literally, having three feet). He is the lord of sport. He, the soul of all, has two kinds of grandeurs and glory. He who is the lord of Śrī, Bhū and Nīlā is called the lord. Therefore, mastery over all exists in Vāsudeva. He is the lord of sacrifice, is the sacrifice, the enjoyer of sacrifice, the performer of sacrifice, the lord, the enjoyer of sacrifice, the Puruṣa (i.e. the deity) of sacrifice. He alone is the highest lord. He is the lord of sacrifice. He is the enjoyer of the oblations made to gods and all offerings to the dead ancestors. He is immutable. He, Hari, is the lord here. All goblins and demons go away from his vicinity. He, Viṣṇu, who became Virāṭ and Hari, is himself the highest lord, who pleases the three worlds. With him as the complete oblation gods performed a sacrifice. Those who have a double row of teeth are born from that sacrifice. From that sacrifice with all the oblations sprang <em>ṛks</em>, <em>sāmans</em>. From it sprang horses, cows, men etc. The entire world consisting of the mobile and the immobile sprang from the body of the Supreme Being consisting of everything. The castes were his face, arms, thighs and feet in due order. From his feet the earth came up and the heaven from his head. From his mind the moon was produced, and the sun from his eye. Fire with a thousand eyes (sprang) from his mouth, and the ever-moving wind from his breath. From his navel came up Brahmā, the sky, the movable and immovable world. Since the entire world came up from the eternal Viṣṇu, therefore, Viṣṇu full of all, is called Nārāyaṇa. Hari, having thus created the world again devours it, as a spider does the web produced from its saliva. Since, having curbed Brahmā, Indra, Rudra, Yama and Varuṇa, he subdues them, therefore, he is called Hari. This ancient Supreme Being having put the world in his belly, sleeps in the coating of (his) Māyā, which has become an ocean. (In the beginning) here this Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, Acyuta was alone.</p>
<p>89-93. Brahmā, Rudra, gods, great sages, this heaven, this earth, the moon, the sun, the stars, the world, the (cosmic) egg covered by Mahat (were) not there. O auspicious one, since the entire world was held by that Hari (in his belly) and was again created at the time of creation, therefore he is said to be Nārāyaṇa. O Pārvatī, service to him is described in the formula by the dative case. This entire world, beginning with Brahmā, is his slave. Knowing the meaning to be like this one should then use the formula. O you of an excellent face, without knowing the meaning of the formula, one would not get success, so also enjoyment, devotion and salvation.</p>
