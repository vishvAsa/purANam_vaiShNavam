  <h2 id="śesa-said"><em>Śesa said</em>:</h2>
<p>1-7. Looking for king Rāma’s horse the great king’s soldiers endowed with great power (or army) came (there). (They said:) “Where is the horse? Who has taken him? How is it that he is not seen? Who, a very dull one, will go to Yama’s city after having (i.e. because of his having) taken the horse?” While the soldiers of Raghu were searching the course of the horse, the great king surrounded by a large army came (there). He asked all his servants: “Now where is my horse? How is it that the horse, adorned with the golden note is not seen?” Hearing these words of (i.e. uttered by) him, the servants who were following the horse, said: “The horse having the mind’s speed has been snatched away by someone into the forest. Therefore, even though we know the path well, the horse is not noticed. Therefore, O lord, an effort should be made now to get (back) the horse.” Hearing their words, Śatrughna, the killer of his enemies, and having a fascinating form, asked Sumati:</p>
<h2 id="śatrughna-said"><em>Śatrughna said</em>:</h2>
<p>8. Which king stays here? How did he secure the horse? How much is the power (or army) of the king, who has today taken away my horse?</p>
<h2 id="sumati-said"><em>Sumati said</em>:</h2>
<p>9-12. O king, this is Devapura fashioned by the lord himself. It is like the Kailāsa (mountain) inaccessible (even) to hosts of the army, well joined together. In it rules the very brave and valourous king Vīramaṇi, protected by Śiva, and he is ruling justly. He, Śiva who is the destroyer of the whole universe, (but) who always lets loose (his) partiality for his devotee, is won over (by the king) by means of his devotion. So if the horse is taken, there will be a great war. Let the good ones, being careful, protect the army.</p>
<p>13-16. Hearing this, that Śatrughna, the very glorious one, and the crest-jewel of all kings, waited (i.e. got ready to fight) after arranging the army. When he having consultations with his good minister (Sumati), waited comfortably, the divine sage (Nārada), eager (to see) the battle, came there. Having seen the sage, the abode of austerities, that had arrived there, Śatrughna got up (from his seat) and seating him on a seat, offered him a respectful offering. He, skilled in speaking, pleasing Nārada the best sage, with words, said to him pleased with the welcome (offered to him):</p>
<h2 id="śatrughna-said-1"><em>Śatrughna said</em>:</h2>
<p>17-1 9. O highly intelligent brāhmaṇa, tell me where my horse is. My servants, experienced in their duty, cannot trace his course. Tell (me the name of) that insolent kṣatriya who has taken (away) my horse. O you abode of penance, how will the horse be got (back by us)?</p>
<p>Hearing these words of Śatrughna, Nārada, sounding the lute and repeatedly singing Rāma’s account, said:</p>
<h2 id="nārada-said"><em>Nārada</em> <em>said</em>:</h2>
<p>20-24. O king, this is Devapura. Vīramaṇi is the great king there. His son, who was in the forest, has seized your best horse. Today you will wage a very fierce battle (against him). Here (i.e. in this battle) soldiers having might and valour will fall. Therefore, O very powerful one, you should remain here with great effort. Make an array to which access is difficult for the enemy’s soldiers. O king, in it you will have victory over the best king with difficulty. Who would defeat Rāma even on the entire earth?</p>
<p>Speaking like this, the brāhmaṇa disappeared, and remained in the sky watching the very fierce battle like the one between gods and demons.</p>
<h2 id="śeṣa-said"><em>Śeṣa said</em>:</h2>
<p>25-26. Then king Vīramaṇi, the crest-jewel of all brave men, asked his general, very eminent and brave among the enemies, to proclaim loudly by beating the war-drum; and told him with deep sounding words:</p>
<h2 id="vīramaṇi-said"><em>Vīramaṇi said</em>:</h2>
<p>27-31. O general, give the order (with the beating) of the war-drum in my beautiful city. Hearing it, let my well-equipped (heroes) march against Śatrughna.</p>
<p>Hearing the words of Vīramaṇi, the general at that time made the proclamation with the war-drum making a great sound. In every house and on the road the sound of the war-drum was heard: “Let all the heroes present in the capital march (against) Śatrughna. Those who looking upon themselves as brave disobey the order of the king, even though they may be sons or brothers, should be killed by the king’s order. Let the heroes listen to the sound (which is produced) when the war-drum is beaten. Having heard it, they should, without delay, perform their duty.”</p>
<h2 id="śeṣa-said-1"><em>Śeṣa said</em>:</h2>
<p>32-34. The best heroes, having heard the sound of the war-drum, with their bodies decorated with golden armours and with the interior of their hearts delighted by the festival of fight, went to the best king. Some, having put on beautiful helmets on their heads, and very charming due to the armours, and (thus) crores of them well adorned, went (to the king). The furious ones, as a result of the king’s message, went (to the king), in chariots to which two horses looking beautiful due to gems and gold were yoked.</p>
<p>35-45. All of them obeying the command of the king went riding very charming horses to the king’s abode. Rukmāṅgada also, who was well adorned with a distinguished golden armour and a helmet, got into his chariot having mind’s speed. His younger brother Śubhāṅgada, having put on his body an excellent armour full of (i.e. decked with) big gems, went to (participate in) the festival of fight. The king’s brother Vīrasiṃha, proficient in the use of all weapons and missiles went there by the king’s order, for that was a royal order. The king’s sister’s son also who was known as Balamitra, equipped with an armour and a sword, went to the king’s palace. His great general Ripuvāra, making ready the army with its four constituents, reported to the king. Then king Vīramaṇi got into the best chariot full of all weapons and missiles and high due to having high wheels made of gems. Then in the ocean of the heroes the sound of conches, as if well impelling the cowardly warriors to fight, was heard. Kettle-drums sounded by auspicious musicians were beaten on all sides. The troops of him who proceeded to fight, stood there. All (the soldiers) had averted the evil by recitation of hymns; all were adorned with all ornaments. All fully equipped with missiles and weapons went to the battlefield. The mountains and caves were filled with the sounds of kettle-drums and conches. Is it that their sound went to call those who stayed in heaven?</p>
<p>46-48. When that din took place, the great king Vīramaṇi, full of enthusiasm to fight, went to the battlefield. When, after arriving at the battlefield full of chariots and foot-soldiers, he remained there, his army went there like the ocean to wash away the (enemy’s) men from that place. Having seen that army full of warriors fighting from chariots, proficient in (the use of) weapons, and making a great noise, the king (i.e. Śatrughna) said to Sumati:</p>
<h2 id="śatrughna-said-2"><em>Śatrughna said</em>:</h2>
<p>49-50. The powerful Vīramaṇi who had seized our horse, has again come with a great army having four divisions. How should the battle be fought? Who, fierce with might, will fight? Show all those heroes to me, and (show me also) how the desired victory would be had.</p>
<h2 id="sumati-said-1"><em>Sumati said</em>:</h2>
<p>51-54. O lord, that great king, endowed with devotion to Śiva and surrounded by a huge army, has come to fight. Now, let the hero Puṣkala knowing the use of great missiles fight. Let other warriors like Nīlaratna, proficient in fighting (fight). O innocent one, you should fight with Śiva or with the king. He, of a great power and valour, should be conquered in a single combat. In this way, O king, you will be victorious. O very intelligent lord, later you should do what you like.</p>
<h2 id="śeṣa-said-2"><em>Śeṣa said</em>:</h2>
<p>55-57. Hearing these words Śatrughna, the killer of the heroes of his enemy, having determined to fight, ordered his good warriors: “All the kings with their armies proficient in (the use of) weapons, should quickly exert themselves in such a way that I get victory.” Hearing it, those (kings) proficient in fighting, full of great energy, went with their soldiers to fight (against the enemy in order to obtain) victory for the descendant of Raghu.</p>
