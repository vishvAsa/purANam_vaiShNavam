The History of Tirupati by the late Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar, published by the TirumalaTirupati Devasthanams Committee, dealt with the setting in which the sacred Temple of Sri Venkateswara existed under the administration of Hindu, Muslim and British rulers. Such mention as was possible was made, therein, of the various costly endowments and gifts to the Temple. In the present work, the author deals, in addition, with the religious, social and economic aspects of the Temple, the evolu tion of the norm of worship and its effect on the worshippers. The author traces the changes that have occurred in the norm of worship pari passu with the development of the metaphysical and philosophical ideas of the Upanishads as expounded by Sri Ramanuja. He also traces how the Tamil Prabandhams came to find a place in the ritual, even though worship in all Vaishnavite temples were exclusively governed by the appropriate Agamas. In separate chapters, he deals with how food-offerings came into existence as part of ritual, how endowments for the purpose were made, abused and attempted to be set right; the structural development from a one-room Koyil-Alwar to a huge Temple. the form of the Murti and the authorities therefor; and, when and how other idols were installed there. The temples of Sri Govindaraja and Sri V HISTORY OF TIRUPATI Ramaswami and other shrines at Tirupati have been presented to the reader in detail together with the manner and reasons for their affiliation with the main Temple of Sri Venkateswara. A separate chapter is devoted to a retrospect of the Temple administration from ancient times setting out lucidly and cogently the manner in which the Temple was managed originally by the Srikaryakarta appointed by the Pallava Kings; then by the Sabhaiyar constituted by the village assembly of Tiruchanur during the period of the later Pallava and Chola Kings; thereafter, by the Sthanattar appointed by the Yadavarayas; and how after the Yadavarayas, the Sthanattar divided themselves into two units, one for the secular and the other for the religious administration of the Temple until it passed into the hands of the Nawab of Arcot. The author has devoted four separate chapters to the development and zenith of the Temple, the increase of food offerings and festivals and consolidation of the religious community during the Vijayanagar reign i.e., from the time of Saluva Narasimha to Sadasivaraya and the Aravidu Kings. Separate chapters have also been devoted for the Agamas and the Alwars and Acharyas. The author’s presentation of the several forgotten portions of the Agamas is original and will dispel the general impression that temple worship is merely pantheistic. The work is very original and the author’s deep study, of not only the inscriptions but also of the vi INTRODUCTION various sacred texts has resulted in giving a rational explanation of the various, and even minute, details of worship and endowment, the interconnections of which have been forgotten or rendered oblivious through the dim vista of distant centuries. I trust. this will be the first in the line of such thought-provoking works in respect of religious institutions and hope that managements of other such institutions will have all their historic records collected and presented by competent persons to the worshippers. The author is eminently fitted to have undertaken this work and he has done it in a way worthy of the great traditions of his family and of his personality. It is his life mission and he has placed the world under great gratitude. At this age that he should have attempted this task and finished so well speaks volumes of his sincerity and devotion to this task. MADRAS, 2-2-1953 } (Sd.) K. VENKATASWAMI NAIDU PREFACE. At an age past seventy, while I was compiling a table of latitudes and longitudes for various places in India, the Will of God slowly instilled into me the idea of writing this book on the famous temple of Tirupati or Tiruvengadam. While I was attempting to find out from ancient inscriptions the chronological methods of recording the dates and the changes in such methods from time to time, I referred to the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam Inscriptions published in six volumes. Going through the first of the volumes, the polished language and the deep piety in which some of them were couched evoked my interest in the higher aspect of the subject matter of the same. Particularly, the imprecation in Inscription No. 8 in Vol. I. caught my imagination. The devout Princess Samavai, in making endowments to the Silver Murti of Bhoga Srinivasa installed by her in 966 A.D., says Both the feet of those who protect this Dharman shall for ever be adornments to my head&#34; and appeals to Sri Vaishnavas in particular to protect the charity. This is very inspiring relief to the other inscriptions relating to later foundations of charity in referring to which the donors invoked curses on those who disturb them saying “Those who disturb this charity shall be incurring the sin of having slaughtered a hundred cows in Kasi.” The inspiration produced by the love of mankind, the piety and humility of no less than a Princess of the time can only be felt. Such was the height of culture of our mothers and fathers in ancient India much of which has been lost but which, I dare say, could still be revived. Thus inspired, in my quest I could not find any work dealing with the structural, religious, ritualistic, economic, administrative and social developments of the temple. I have, therefore, in my humble way traced in this book how from probably an open wooden structure as might be inferred from Kulasekhara Alwar’s songs, the temple has developed by stages of a single-room stone structure which was thereafter reinforced by a wall outside into its present size and magnificence, how Samavai installed the silver Murti ix HISTORY OF TIRUPATI of Bhoga Srinivasa with the resultant increase of worshippers; how the Vaikhanasa Agamic form of worship yielded itself to the present form from the time of Ramanuja; how social equality was put into practice and achieved to a great extent by the adoption of Nammalwar’s Tiruvoimoli, during religious gatherings and festivals, inculcating the Bhakti form of worship; how the taxation policy of the state was framed from time to time with a view to developing the temple and the cult it stood for with particular reference to the taxes that existed; how food offerings were introduced tackling successfully socio-economic problems; how endowments were conceived, founded and administered by various classes of people at various stages of development with various objects; how the administration passed by stages from state control to popular control, from the Madaptyadar appointed by the King to the Sabhaiyar or committee chosen by the King and later to the Sthanattar chosen by persons interested in the institution and the shape things took up to the present day through the Muslim and British rule. In order to set forth the structural and ritualistic significance of the temple, I had to study the Agamas in their original as there is no work dealing with the subject in any of the popular languages. I have endeavoured to present in English, with as much detail as possible, the significance of the Agamic forms in a separate chapter. Likewise, I have devoted separate chapters for the Alwars and Acharyas and their influence on the Temple and on the spread of Srivaishnavism. In separate chapters, I have dealt with the historical connection of the various rulers of the land with this Temple. I am grateful to the Lord who enabled me to complete a work which, from its nature and volume, would have been too formidable to attempt at any age, with decaying health and an eye-sight which has almost failed. In writing this work, the one thing I tangibly felt is that, if He wills nothing is impossible. He gave me the steadfastness, energy, eye-sight and the willing and affectionate co-operation of eminent men and good friends who never felt tired to give me suggestions and some of whom sat for hours with me doing tiresome work. I shall be failing in my duty if I do not specially XPREFACE thank Dr. B. S. Baliga, the Curator, and Sri M. C. Subramanya Iyer, the Assistant Curator, Madras Record Office, for the advice and suggestions they gave me from the time I began this work. I have also to thank the Hon’ble Justice Sri P. V. Rajamannar, the Hon’ble Justice P. Rajagopalan and Sri V. K. Narasimhan of The Hindu for reading through the first draft of the book and giving me encouraging advice. I feel highly grateful to Sri C. Rajagopalachariar, the Chief Minister of Madras, and Sri K. Venkataswami Naidu Garu, the Minister for Endowments, to the former for the Foreword and the latter for the Introduction to this book. The Members of the T. T. Devasthanam Committee with Sri Venkataswami Naidu Garu as the President have encouraged me by taking it as a Devasthanam publication. The present Board of Trustees and their Chairman, Sri V. S. Thyagaraja Mudaliar, have evinced keen interest in getting the work completed. Sri C. Anna Rao Garu, the very energetic and talented Executive Officer of the Devasthanams, has been continuously taking deep interest in the publication without which it could not have been completed so early. My thanks are also due to Sri Parthasarathy Bhattacharya for reading through the chapter on Temples and Agamas and giving useful suggestions. Sti D. T. Tatacharya, M.O.L., has not only been going through the proofs carefully and giving valuable advice but also has been seeing to my properly interpreting the Siddhantha aspect of temple worship. Sri T. R. Narasimhan, B.A the Superintendent of the T.T.D. Press has been largely responsible for having the work executed in the Press and for getting the blocks of the drawings and pictures carefully prepared. Sri P. Chenchuramiah, the Devasthanam Draftsman, prepared the important drawings and the tracings for making the blocks. My sincere thanks are due to them. Lastly, I have to say that no thanks can adequately express my deep debt to Sri M. Narasimhachariar, Assistant Public Prosecutor, Chittoor, for sparing continuously a portion of his valuable time for correcting my manuscripts, giving instructive suggestions and, in short, for dealing with this work as his own. 12-1-‘53.

Geography, Topography and Topology. TIRUMALA has always been known by its ancient name Vengadam (Tiruvengadam); and the Hill on which the Temple stands was known as the Vengadam Hills. Tirupati owes its importance to having been, from the date of its founding, a necessary adjunct to Tirumala. Sri Ramanuja is said to have done this about the beginning of the twelfth century A.D. But the precise date cannot now be ascertained directly with any degree of accuracy. There was obviously a very petty village with a small shrine of Sri Parthasarathy Swami even before Sri Ramanuja’s advent. There is, however, neither inscriptional evidence nor tradition about this. Tiruchanur, known in ancient days as Tiruchchokinur and Tiruchchukanur, is more ancient than Tirupati, although it cannot claim the same antiquity as Vengadam. Chandragiri is another place about 7 miles West of Tirupati and about 5 miles South of the Hill; and the road from Chandragiri affords a second access to the Tirumala Temple. A glance at the map usually attached to the 1 M. &amp; S.M. Railway guide will show that a Metre gauge chord line from Katpadi junction to Renigunta junction and thence to the Gudur junction connects Tirupati with the Broad gauge S.W., N.W. and N.E. lines of that railway system, all converging towards Madras. To follow the modern practice of locating places, we may state that Tirumala is in Lat. Tirupati is in Lat. 13° 41’ N Long. 79°-21’ E. 13°-38’ N Long. 79°-25’ E. Long. 79°-27’ E. Long. 79°-19’ E.

The History of Tirupati by the late Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar, published by the TirumalaTirupati Devasthanams Committee, dealt with the setting in which the sacred Temple of Sri Venkateswara existed under the administration of Hindu, Muslim and British rulers. Such mention as was possible was made, therein, of the various costly endowments and gifts to the Temple. In the present work, the author deals, in addition, with the religious, social and economic aspects of the Temple, the evolu tion of the norm of worship and its effect on the worshippers. The author traces the changes that have occurred in the norm of worship pari passu with the development of the metaphysical and philosophical ideas of the Upanishads as expounded by Sri Ramanuja. He also traces how the Tamil Prabandhams came to find a place in the ritual, even though worship in all Vaishnavite temples were exclusively governed by the appropriate Agamas. In separate chapters, he deals with how food-offerings came into existence as part of ritual, how endowments for the purpose were made, abused and attempted to be set right; the structural development from a one-room Koyil-Alwar to a huge Temple. the form of the Murti and the authorities therefor; and, when and how other idols were installed there. The temples of Sri Govindaraja and Sri V HISTORY OF TIRUPATI Ramaswami and other shrines at Tirupati have been presented to the reader in detail together with the manner and reasons for their affiliation with the main Temple of Sri Venkateswara. A separate chapter is devoted to a retrospect of the Temple administration from ancient times setting out lucidly and cogently the manner in which the Temple was managed originally by the Srikaryakarta appointed by the Pallava Kings; then by the Sabhaiyar constituted by the village assembly of Tiruchanur during the period of the later Pallava and Chola Kings; thereafter, by the Sthanattar appointed by the Yadavarayas; and how after the Yadavarayas, the Sthanattar divided themselves into two units, one for the secular and the other for the religious administration of the Temple until it passed into the hands of the Nawab of Arcot. The author has devoted four separate chapters to the development and zenith of the Temple, the increase of food offerings and festivals and consolidation of the religious community during the Vijayanagar reign i.e., from the time of Saluva Narasimha to Sadasivaraya and the Aravidu Kings. Separate chapters have also been devoted for the Agamas and the Alwars and Acharyas. The author’s presentation of the several forgotten portions of the Agamas is original and will dispel the general impression that temple worship is merely pantheistic. The work is very original and the author’s deep study, of not only the inscriptions but also of the vi INTRODUCTION various sacred texts has resulted in giving a rational explanation of the various, and even minute, details of worship and endowment, the interconnections of which have been forgotten or rendered oblivious through the dim vista of distant centuries. I trust. this will be the first in the line of such thought-provoking works in respect of religious institutions and hope that managements of other such institutions will have all their historic records collected and presented by competent persons to the worshippers. The author is eminently fitted to have undertaken this work and he has done it in a way worthy of the great traditions of his family and of his personality. It is his life mission and he has placed the world under great gratitude. At this age that he should have attempted this task and finished so well speaks volumes of his sincerity and devotion to this task. MADRAS, 2-2-1953 } (Sd.) K. VENKATASWAMI NAIDU PREFACE. At an age past seventy, while I was compiling a table of latitudes and longitudes for various places in India, the Will of God slowly instilled into me the idea of writing this book on the famous temple of Tirupati or Tiruvengadam. While I was attempting to find out from ancient inscriptions the chronological methods of recording the dates and the changes in such methods from time to time, I referred to the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam Inscriptions published in six volumes. Going through the first of the volumes, the polished language and the deep piety in which some of them were couched evoked my interest in the higher aspect of the subject matter of the same. Particularly, the imprecation in Inscription No. 8 in Vol. I. caught my imagination. The devout Princess Samavai, in making endowments to the Silver Murti of Bhoga Srinivasa installed by her in 966 A.D., says Both the feet of those who protect this Dharman shall for ever be adornments to my head&#34; and appeals to Sri Vaishnavas in particular to protect the charity. This is very inspiring relief to the other inscriptions relating to later foundations of charity in referring to which the donors invoked curses on those who disturb them saying “Those who disturb this charity shall be incurring the sin of having slaughtered a hundred cows in Kasi.” The inspiration produced by the love of mankind, the piety and humility of no less than a Princess of the time can only be felt. Such was the height of culture of our mothers and fathers in ancient India much of which has been lost but which, I dare say, could still be revived. Thus inspired, in my quest I could not find any work dealing with the structural, religious, ritualistic, economic, administrative and social developments of the temple. I have, therefore, in my humble way traced in this book how from probably an open wooden structure as might be inferred from Kulasekhara Alwar’s songs, the temple has developed by stages of a single-room stone structure which was thereafter reinforced by a wall outside into its present size and magnificence, how Samavai installed the silver Murti ix HISTORY OF TIRUPATI of Bhoga Srinivasa with the resultant increase of worshippers; how the Vaikhanasa Agamic form of worship yielded itself to the present form from the time of Ramanuja; how social equality was put into practice and achieved to a great extent by the adoption of Nammalwar’s Tiruvoimoli, during religious gatherings and festivals, inculcating the Bhakti form of worship; how the taxation policy of the state was framed from time to time with a view to developing the temple and the cult it stood for with particular reference to the taxes that existed; how food offerings were introduced tackling successfully socio-economic problems; how endowments were conceived, founded and administered by various classes of people at various stages of development with various objects; how the administration passed by stages from state control to popular control, from the Madaptyadar appointed by the King to the Sabhaiyar or committee chosen by the King and later to the Sthanattar chosen by persons interested in the institution and the shape things took up to the present day through the Muslim and British rule. In order to set forth the structural and ritualistic significance of the temple, I had to study the Agamas in their original as there is no work dealing with the subject in any of the popular languages. I have endeavoured to present in English, with as much detail as possible, the significance of the Agamic forms in a separate chapter. Likewise, I have devoted separate chapters for the Alwars and Acharyas and their influence on the Temple and on the spread of Srivaishnavism. In separate chapters, I have dealt with the historical connection of the various rulers of the land with this Temple. I am grateful to the Lord who enabled me to complete a work which, from its nature and volume, would have been too formidable to attempt at any age, with decaying health and an eye-sight which has almost failed. In writing this work, the one thing I tangibly felt is that, if He wills nothing is impossible. He gave me the steadfastness, energy, eye-sight and the willing and affectionate co-operation of eminent men and good friends who never felt tired to give me suggestions and some of whom sat for hours with me doing tiresome work. I shall be failing in my duty if I do not specially XPREFACE thank Dr. B. S. Baliga, the Curator, and Sri M. C. Subramanya Iyer, the Assistant Curator, Madras Record Office, for the advice and suggestions they gave me from the time I began this work. I have also to thank the Hon’ble Justice Sri P. V. Rajamannar, the Hon’ble Justice P. Rajagopalan and Sri V. K. Narasimhan of The Hindu for reading through the first draft of the book and giving me encouraging advice. I feel highly grateful to Sri C. Rajagopalachariar, the Chief Minister of Madras, and Sri K. Venkataswami Naidu Garu, the Minister for Endowments, to the former for the Foreword and the latter for the Introduction to this book. The Members of the T. T. Devasthanam Committee with Sri Venkataswami Naidu Garu as the President have encouraged me by taking it as a Devasthanam publication. The present Board of Trustees and their Chairman, Sri V. S. Thyagaraja Mudaliar, have evinced keen interest in getting the work completed. Sri C. Anna Rao Garu, the very energetic and talented Executive Officer of the Devasthanams, has been continuously taking deep interest in the publication without which it could not have been completed so early. My thanks are also due to Sri Parthasarathy Bhattacharya for reading through the chapter on Temples and Agamas and giving useful suggestions. Sti D. T. Tatacharya, M.O.L., has not only been going through the proofs carefully and giving valuable advice but also has been seeing to my properly interpreting the Siddhantha aspect of temple worship. Sri T. R. Narasimhan, B.A the Superintendent of the T.T.D. Press has been largely responsible for having the work executed in the Press and for getting the blocks of the drawings and pictures carefully prepared. Sri P. Chenchuramiah, the Devasthanam Draftsman, prepared the important drawings and the tracings for making the blocks. My sincere thanks are due to them. Lastly, I have to say that no thanks can adequately express my deep debt to Sri M. Narasimhachariar, Assistant Public Prosecutor, Chittoor, for sparing continuously a portion of his valuable time for correcting my manuscripts, giving instructive suggestions and, in short, for dealing with this work as his own. 12-1-‘53.

Geography, Topography and Topology. TIRUMALA has always been known by its ancient name Vengadam (Tiruvengadam); and the Hill on which the Temple stands was known as the Vengadam Hills. Tirupati owes its importance to having been, from the date of its founding, a necessary adjunct to Tirumala. Sri Ramanuja is said to have done this about the beginning of the twelfth century A.D. But the precise date cannot now be ascertained directly with any degree of accuracy. There was obviously a very petty village with a small shrine of Sri Parthasarathy Swami even before Sri Ramanuja’s advent. There is, however, neither inscriptional evidence nor tradition about this. Tiruchanur, known in ancient days as Tiruchchokinur and Tiruchchukanur, is more ancient than Tirupati, although it cannot claim the same antiquity as Vengadam. Chandragiri is another place about 7 miles West of Tirupati and about 5 miles South of the Hill; and the road from Chandragiri affords a second access to the Tirumala Temple. A glance at the map usually attached to the 1 M. &amp; S.M. Railway guide will show that a Metre gauge chord line from Katpadi junction to Renigunta junction and thence to the Gudur junction connects Tirupati with the Broad gauge S.W., N.W. and N.E. lines of that railway system, all converging towards Madras. To follow the modern practice of locating places, we may state that Tirumala is in Lat. Tirupati is in Lat. 13° 41’ N Long. 79°-21’ E. 13°-38’ N Long. 79°-25’ E. Long. 79°-27’ E. Long. 79°-19’ E.

The History of Tirupati by the late Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar, published by the TirumalaTirupati Devasthanams Committee, dealt with the setting in which the sacred Temple of Sri Venkateswara existed under the administration of Hindu, Muslim and British rulers. Such mention as was possible was made, therein, of the various costly endowments and gifts to the Temple. In the present work, the author deals, in addition, with the religious, social and economic aspects of the Temple, the evolu tion of the norm of worship and its effect on the worshippers. The author traces the changes that have occurred in the norm of worship pari passu with the development of the metaphysical and philosophical ideas of the Upanishads as expounded by Sri Ramanuja. He also traces how the Tamil Prabandhams came to find a place in the ritual, even though worship in all Vaishnavite temples were exclusively governed by the appropriate Agamas. In separate chapters, he deals with how food-offerings came into existence as part of ritual, how endowments for the purpose were made, abused and attempted to be set right; the structural development from a one-room Koyil-Alwar to a huge Temple. the form of the Murti and the authorities therefor; and, when and how other idols were installed there. The temples of Sri Govindaraja and Sri V HISTORY OF TIRUPATI Ramaswami and other shrines at Tirupati have been presented to the reader in detail together with the manner and reasons for their affiliation with the main Temple of Sri Venkateswara.

The author has devoted four separate chapters to the development and zenith of the Temple, the increase of food offerings and festivals and consolidation of the religious community during the Vijayanagar reign i.e., from the time of Saluva Narasimha to Sadasivaraya and the Aravidu Kings. Separate chapters have also been devoted for the Agamas and the Alwars and Acharyas.

At an age past seventy, while I was compiling a table of latitudes and longitudes for various places in India, the Will of God slowly instilled into me the idea of writing this book on the famous temple of Tirupati or Tiruvengadam. While I was attempting to find out from ancient inscriptions the chronological methods of recording the dates and the changes in such methods from time to time, I referred to the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam Inscriptions published in six volumes. Going through the first of the volumes, the polished language and the deep piety in which some of them were couched evoked my interest in the higher aspect of the subject matter of the same. Particularly, the imprecation in Inscription No. 8 in Vol. I. caught my imagination. The devout Princess Samavai, in making endowments to the Silver Murti of Bhoga Srinivasa installed by her in 966 A.D., says Both the feet of those who protect this Dharman shall for ever be adornments to my head&#34; and appeals to Sri Vaishnavas in particular to protect the charity. This is very inspiring relief to the other inscriptions relating to later foundations of charity in referring to which the donors invoked curses on those who disturb them saying “Those who disturb this charity shall be incurring the sin of having slaughtered a hundred cows in Kasi.” The inspiration produced by the love of mankind, the piety and humility of no less than a Princess of the time can only be felt. Such was the height of culture of our mothers and fathers in ancient India much of which has been lost but which, I dare say, could still be revived. Thus inspired, in my quest I could not find any work dealing with the structural, religious, ritualistic, economic, administrative and social developments of the temple. I have, therefore, in my humble way traced in this book how from probably an open wooden structure as might be inferred from Kulasekhara Alwar’s songs, the temple has developed by stages of a single-room stone structure which was thereafter reinforced by a wall outside into its present size and magnificence, how Samavai installed the silver Murti ix HISTORY OF TIRUPATI of Bhoga Srinivasa with the resultant increase of worshippers; how the Vaikhanasa Agamic form of worship yielded itself to the present form from the time of Ramanuja; how social equality was put into practice and achieved to a great extent by the adoption of Nammalwar’s Tiruvoimoli, during religious gatherings and festivals, inculcating the Bhakti form of worship; how the taxation policy of the state was framed from time to time with a view to developing the temple and the cult it stood for with particular reference to the taxes that existed; how food offerings were introduced tackling successfully socio-economic problems; how endowments were conceived, founded and administered by various classes of people at various stages of development with various objects; how the administration passed by stages from state control to popular control, from the Madaptyadar appointed by the King to the Sabhaiyar or committee chosen by the King and later to the Sthanattar chosen by persons interested in the institution and the shape things took up to the present day through the Muslim and British rule. In order to set forth the structural and ritualistic significance of the temple, I had to study the Agamas in their original as there is no work dealing with the subject in any of the popular languages. I have endeavoured to present in English, with as much detail as possible, the significance of the Agamic forms in a separate chapter. Likewise, I have devoted separate chapters for the Alwars and Acharyas and their influence on the Temple and on the spread of Srivaishnavism. In separate chapters, I have dealt with the historical connection of the various rulers of the land with this Temple. I am grateful to the Lord who enabled me to complete a work which, from its nature and volume, would have been too formidable to attempt at any age, with decaying health and an eye-sight which has almost failed. In writing this work, the one thing I tangibly felt is that, if He wills nothing is impossible. He gave me the steadfastness, energy, eye-sight and the willing and affectionate co-operation of eminent men and good friends who never felt tired to give me suggestions and some of whom sat for hours with me doing tiresome work. I shall be failing in my duty if I do not specially XPREFACE thank Dr. B. S. Baliga, the Curator, and Sri M. C. Subramanya Iyer, the Assistant Curator, Madras Record Office, for the advice and suggestions they gave me from the time I began this work. I have also to thank the Hon’ble Justice Sri P. V. Rajamannar, the Hon’ble Justice P. Rajagopalan and Sri V. K. Narasimhan of The Hindu for reading through the first draft of the book and giving me encouraging advice. I feel highly grateful to Sri C. Rajagopalachariar, the Chief Minister of Madras, and Sri K. Venkataswami Naidu Garu, the Minister for Endowments, to the former for the Foreword and the latter for the Introduction to this book. The Members of the T. T. Devasthanam Committee with Sri Venkataswami Naidu Garu as the President have encouraged me by taking it as a Devasthanam publication. The present Board of Trustees and their Chairman, Sri V. S. Thyagaraja Mudaliar, have evinced keen interest in getting the work completed. Sri C. Anna Rao Garu, the very energetic and talented Executive Officer of the Devasthanams, has been continuously taking deep interest in the publication without which it could not have been completed so early. My thanks are also due to Sri Parthasarathy Bhattacharya for reading through the chapter on Temples and Agamas and giving useful suggestions. Sti D. T. Tatacharya, M.O.L., has not only been going through the proofs carefully and giving valuable advice but also has been seeing to my properly interpreting the Siddhantha aspect of temple worship. Sri T. R. Narasimhan, B.A the Superintendent of the T.T.D. Press has been largely responsible for having the work executed in the Press and for getting the blocks of the drawings and pictures carefully prepared. Sri P. Chenchuramiah, the Devasthanam Draftsman, prepared the important drawings and the tracings for making the blocks. My sincere thanks are due to them. Lastly, I have to say that no thanks can adequately express my deep debt to Sri M. Narasimhachariar, Assistant Public Prosecutor, Chittoor, for sparing continuously a portion of his valuable time for correcting my manuscripts, giving instructive suggestions and, in short, for dealing with this work as his own. 12-1-‘53.

Geography, Topography and Topology. TIRUMALA has always been known by its ancient name Vengadam (Tiruvengadam); and the Hill on which the Temple stands was known as the Vengadam Hills. Tirupati owes its importance to having been, from the date of its founding, a necessary adjunct to Tirumala. Sri Ramanuja is said to have done this about the beginning of the twelfth century A.D. But the precise date cannot now be ascertained directly with any degree of accuracy. There was obviously a very petty village with a small shrine of Sri Parthasarathy Swami even before Sri Ramanuja’s advent. There is, however, neither inscriptional evidence nor tradition about this. Tiruchanur, known in ancient days as Tiruchchokinur and Tiruchchukanur, is more ancient than Tirupati, although it cannot claim the same antiquity as Vengadam. Chandragiri is another place about 7 miles West of Tirupati and about 5 miles South of the Hill; and the road from Chandragiri affords a second access to the Tirumala Temple. A glance at the map usually attached to the 1 M. &amp; S.M. Railway guide will show that a Metre gauge chord line from Katpadi junction to Renigunta junction and thence to the Gudur junction connects Tirupati with the Broad gauge S.W., N.W. and N.E. lines of that railway system, all converging towards Madras. To follow the modern practice of locating places, we may state that Tirumala is in Lat. Tirupati is in Lat. 13° 41’ N Long. 79°-21’ E. 13°-38’ N Long. 79°-25’ E. Long. 79°-27’ E. Long. 79°-19’ E. Tiruchchukanur in Lat. 13-36’ Chandragiri is in Lat. 13°-35’">

FOREWORD
From time immemorial, Tirumala, the Holy Abode of Lord Venkateswara has been venerated as one of the most hallowed places The Vedas, ancient Tamil works of the Sangam period, the pasurams of Alwars and the sankirtanas of Tallapaka poets proclaim that the Lord of Seven Hills is the most blissful Archa form of Sriman Narayana Many great dynasties of the South, especially the Pallavas, the Cholas, the Pandyas, and the Vijayanagar emperors liberally patronised the Tirumala temple and the inscriptions found on the walls in the temples at Tirumala and Tirupati give more or less a vivid picture of the Temple and its administration from ninth century to eighteenth century
Sn 1 KT Viraraghavacharya&rsquo;s History of Tirupati&rsquo; which was first published in 1953 deals with the history of the temple, its layout and general administration After closely studying the available source materials like the inscriptions, ancient records and literary works, late Sn Viraraghavacharya has meticulously brought out a comprehenseve account of the temples of Tirumala and Tirupati The author who was basically an engineer by profession combines his scientific spirit of enquiry with his traditional theistic approach to present a lucid and fairly accurate History of Tirumala Temple
It is also our endeavour to bring out many more books on sanatana dharma, agamas, temple art and architecture, scriptural texts, besides illustrated books for our young readers Much emphasis is also laid on reprinting some of the popular publications which were not available for several years

INTRODUCTION.
The History of Tirupati by the late Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar, published by the TirumalaTirupati Devasthanams Committee, dealt with the setting in which the sacred Temple of Sri Venkateswara existed under the administration of Hindu, Muslim and British rulers. Such mention as was possible was made, therein, of the various costly endowments and gifts to the Temple. In the present work, the author deals, in addition, with the religious, social and economic aspects of the Temple, the evolu tion of the norm of worship and its effect on the worshippers.
The author traces the changes that have occurred in the norm of worship pari passu with the development of the metaphysical and philosophical ideas of the Upanishads as expounded by Sri Ramanuja. He also traces how the Tamil Prabandhams came to find a place in the ritual, even though worship in all Vaishnavite temples were exclusively governed by the appropriate Agamas. In separate chapters, he deals with how food-offerings came into existence as part of ritual, how endowments for the purpose were made, abused and attempted to be set right; the structural development from a one-room Koyil-Alwar to a huge Temple. the form of the Murti and the authorities therefor; and, when and how other idols were installed there. The temples of Sri Govindaraja and Sri

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Ramaswami and other shrines at Tirupati have been presented to the reader in detail together with the manner and reasons for their affiliation with the main Temple of Sri Venkateswara.
A separate chapter is devoted to a retrospect of the Temple administration from ancient times setting out lucidly and cogently the manner in which the Temple was managed originally by the Srikaryakarta appointed by the Pallava Kings; then by the Sabhaiyar constituted by the village assembly of Tiruchanur during the period of the later Pallava and Chola Kings; thereafter, by the Sthanattar appointed by the Yadavarayas; and how after the Yadavarayas, the Sthanattar divided themselves into two units, one for the secular and the other for the religious administration of the Temple until it passed into the hands of the Nawab of Arcot.
The author has devoted four separate chapters to the development and zenith of the Temple, the increase of food offerings and festivals and consolidation of the religious community during the Vijayanagar reign i.e., from the time of Saluva Narasimha to Sadasivaraya and the Aravidu Kings.
Separate chapters have also been devoted for the Agamas and the Alwars and Acharyas. The author&rsquo;s presentation of the several forgotten portions of the Agamas is original and will dispel the general impression that temple worship is merely pantheistic.
The work is very original and the author&rsquo;s deep study, of not only the inscriptions but also of the
vi
INTRODUCTION
various sacred texts has resulted in giving a rational explanation of the various, and even minute, details of worship and endowment, the interconnections of which have been forgotten or rendered oblivious through the dim vista of distant centuries. I trust. this will be the first in the line of such thought-provoking works in respect of religious institutions and hope that managements of other such institutions will have all their historic records collected and presented by competent persons to the worshippers.
The author is eminently fitted to have undertaken this work and he has done it in a way worthy of the great traditions of his family and of his personality. It is his life mission and he has placed the world under great gratitude. At this age that he should have attempted this task and finished so well speaks volumes of his sincerity and devotion to this task.

PREFACE.
At an age past seventy, while I was compiling a table of latitudes and longitudes for various places in India, the Will of God slowly instilled into me the idea of writing this book on the famous temple of Tirupati or Tiruvengadam. While I was attempting to find out from ancient inscriptions the chronological methods of recording the dates and the changes in such methods from time to time, I referred to the Tirumalai-Tirupati Devasthanam Inscriptions published in six volumes. Going through the first of the volumes, the polished language and the deep piety in which some of them were couched evoked my interest in the higher aspect of the subject matter of the same. Particularly, the imprecation in Inscription No. 8 in Vol. I. caught my imagination. The devout Princess Samavai, in making endowments to the Silver Murti of Bhoga Srinivasa installed by her in 966 A.D., says Both the feet of those who protect this Dharman shall for ever be adornments to my head&quot; and appeals to Sri Vaishnavas in particular to protect the charity. This is very inspiring relief to the other inscriptions relating to later foundations of charity in referring to which the donors invoked curses on those who disturb them saying &ldquo;Those who disturb this charity shall be incurring the sin of having slaughtered a hundred cows in Kasi.&rdquo; The inspiration produced by the love of mankind, the piety and humility of no less than a Princess of the time can only be felt. Such was the height of culture of our mothers and fathers in ancient India much of which has been lost but which, I dare say, could still be revived.
Thus inspired, in my quest I could not find any work dealing with the structural, religious, ritualistic, economic, administrative and social developments of the temple. I have, therefore, in my humble way traced in this book how from probably an open wooden structure as might be inferred from Kulasekhara Alwar&rsquo;s songs, the temple has developed by stages of a single-room stone structure which was thereafter reinforced by a wall outside into its present size and magnificence, how Samavai installed the silver Murti
ix
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of Bhoga Srinivasa with the resultant increase of worshippers; how the Vaikhanasa Agamic form of worship yielded itself to the present form from the time of Ramanuja; how social equality was put into practice and achieved to a great extent by the adoption of Nammalwar&rsquo;s Tiruvoimoli, during religious gatherings and festivals, inculcating the Bhakti form of worship; how the taxation policy of the state was framed from time to time with a view to developing the temple and the cult it stood for with particular reference to the taxes that existed; how food offerings were introduced tackling successfully socio-economic problems; how endowments were conceived, founded and administered by various classes of people at various stages of development with various objects; how the administration passed by stages from state control to popular control, from the Madaptyadar appointed by the King to the Sabhaiyar or committee chosen by the King and later to the Sthanattar chosen by persons interested in the institution and the shape things took up to the present day through the Muslim and British rule.
In order to set forth the structural and ritualistic significance of the temple, I had to study the Agamas in their original as there is no work dealing with the subject in any of the popular languages. I have endeavoured to present in English, with as much detail as possible, the significance of the Agamic forms in a separate chapter. Likewise, I have devoted separate chapters for the Alwars and Acharyas and their influence on the Temple and on the spread of Srivaishnavism. In separate chapters, I have dealt with the historical connection of the various rulers of the land with this Temple.
I am grateful to the Lord who enabled me to complete a work which, from its nature and volume, would have been too formidable to attempt at any age, with decaying health and an eye-sight which has almost failed. In writing this work, the one thing I tangibly felt is that, if He wills nothing is impossible. He gave me the steadfastness, energy, eye-sight and the willing and affectionate co-operation of eminent men and good friends who never felt tired to give me suggestions and some of whom sat for hours with me doing tiresome work. I shall be failing in my duty if I do not specially

thank Dr. B. S. Baliga, the Curator, and Sri M. C. Subramanya Iyer, the Assistant Curator, Madras Record Office, for the advice and suggestions they gave me from the time I began this work. I have also to thank the Hon&rsquo;ble Justice Sri P. V. Rajamannar, the Hon&rsquo;ble Justice P. Rajagopalan and Sri V. K. Narasimhan of The Hindu for reading through the first draft of the book and giving me encouraging advice. I feel highly grateful to Sri C. Rajagopalachariar, the Chief Minister of Madras, and Sri K. Venkataswami Naidu Garu, the Minister for Endowments, to the former for the Foreword and the latter for the Introduction to this book. The Members of the T. T. Devasthanam Committee with Sri Venkataswami Naidu Garu as the President have encouraged me by taking it as a Devasthanam publication. The present Board of Trustees and their Chairman, Sri V. S. Thyagaraja Mudaliar, have evinced keen interest in getting the work completed. Sri C. Anna Rao Garu, the very energetic and talented Executive Officer of the Devasthanams, has been continuously taking deep interest in the publication without which it could not have been completed so early. My thanks are also due to Sri Parthasarathy Bhattacharya for reading through the chapter on Temples and Agamas and giving useful suggestions. Sti D. T. Tatacharya, M.O.L., has not only been going through the proofs carefully and giving valuable advice but also has been seeing to my properly interpreting the Siddhantha aspect of temple worship. Sri T. R. Narasimhan, B.A the Superintendent of the T.T.D. Press has been largely responsible for having the work executed in the Press and for getting the blocks of the drawings and pictures carefully prepared. Sri P. Chenchuramiah, the Devasthanam Draftsman, prepared the important drawings and the tracings for making the blocks. My sincere thanks are due to them. Lastly, I have to say that no thanks can adequately express my deep debt to Sri M. Narasimhachariar, Assistant Public Prosecutor, Chittoor, for sparing continuously a portion of his valuable time for correcting my manuscripts, giving instructive suggestions and, in short, for dealing with this work as his own.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
(The Tirumala, Tirupati Temples)
CHAPTER I
TIRUMALA, TIRUPATI AND TIRUCHANUR.
Geography, Topography and Topology.
TIRUMALA has always been known by its ancient name Vengadam (Tiruvengadam); and the Hill on which the Temple stands was known as the Vengadam Hills. Tirupati owes its importance to having been, from the date of its founding, a necessary adjunct to Tirumala. Sri Ramanuja is said to have done this about the beginning of the twelfth century A.D. But the precise date cannot now be ascertained directly with any degree of accuracy. There was obviously a very petty village with a small shrine of Sri Parthasarathy Swami even before Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s advent. There is, however, neither inscriptional evidence nor tradition about this. Tiruchanur, known in ancient days as Tiruchchokinur and Tiruchchukanur, is more ancient than Tirupati, although it cannot claim the same antiquity as Vengadam. Chandragiri is another place about 7 miles West of Tirupati and about 5 miles South of the Hill; and the road from Chandragiri affords a second access to the Tirumala Temple.
A glance at the map usually attached to the 1 M. &amp; S.M. Railway guide will show that a Metre gauge chord line from Katpadi junction to Renigunta junction and thence to the Gudur junction connects Tirupati with the Broad gauge S.W., N.W. and N.E. lines of that railway system, all converging towards Madras. To follow the modern practice of locating places, we may state that

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Tirupati is served by a railway station which is located at almost the south-east end of the town. Tiruchanur has a railway station about two miles away from the village. Chandragiri Railway Station is practically between the Tirumala Hill and the village of Chandragiri. To reach Tirupati pilgrims have to change from the Broad gauge to the metre gauge at Katpadi, Renigunta or Gudur.1
The traditional ascent to the Hill has been from Tirupati, crossing a series of seven hills or ridges by a pathway paved mostly with rough sandstone boulders, although in later years cut-stone steps were introduced where steep ascents and descents have to be negotiated. Even this ascent has now become antiquated owing to the construction of a metalled motor road within the past ten years. While the ascent by foot along the old route would take 2 to 3 hours, the travel in a motor vehicle does not take more than an hour. The Government of Madras 2 are now running daily a regular bus service for pilgrims from Madras to Tirupati and back. The old route is still being used by people who are too poor to pay the motor fare or who have taken a vow to ascend on foot. The foot path route is provided with electric lighting.
The old route entails more physical exertion and subjects pilgrims who are unable to walk the entire distance to the vexatious behaviour of the dholiwallahs who are engaged to carry them. But it has the distinct advantage that the pilgrim has ample opportunity to admire the beautiful landscape presented to his view from various points during the ascent. &ldquo;The remarkable and highly picturesque scenery is due to the great mural scarps into which the massive quartzite beds have been worn. The quartzites are generally very massive and semivitreous in texture and occur in thick beds, which often show but little lamination. The prevalent colours of the quartzites are pale greys and drabs,</li>
<li>Now there are direct express trains from Madras, Vijayawada, Hyderabad, and Puri.

all weathering to shades of buff or pale orange. The principal lines of scarp face the south. In places we find bare walls standing vertically.&rdquo; After the steep and arduous ascent of the first hill, the pilgrim approaches the big tower (Gopuram) known as the Gali Gopuram-which however came into existence only in 1628 as the gift of Matla Anantaraya. If from here the pilgrim turns back facing south, he sees laid out before him a fine landscape with the railway line and the river Swarnamukhi traversing the plains, with a number of tanks dotted all over the road, winding its way through, and the towers of the temples in Tirupati and Tiruchanur raising their heads above the houses. To his left is the huge mass of quartzite blocks rising vertically.
Walking further along, he has an easy ascent with here and there level country to break the monotony. On either side there is rich vegetation. At the Avachāri Kōna (or Ammayār Kāneru) he meets with a sharp descent into a ravine followed by a difficult ascent on the other side known as the KNEE BREAKER ** hill. This ravine is one of the loveliest sights and the pilgrim rarely fails to halt for 15 to 30 minutes to enjoy the scenery and to refresh himself. Nearing the top of this ascent there is a small mantapam and shrine of Sri Ramanuja called Bhashyakar Sannadhi, which has a tradition connected with it. The tradition is that it was at this mantapam that Sri Ramanuja daily studied under his uncle Tirumala Nambi the various esoteric meanings of the Ramayana. It was also at this place that Sri Ramanuja was received by his uncle Tirumala Nambi with all Temple honours when he visited Tirumala after he was given the distinctive titles of Emberumānār, etc There are a number of mantapams all along the route. There is also a deep step well, the Muggu Bāvi. A little further to the left and away from the track is a structure called the Ghanta Mantapam, where tradition tells us there used to hang a bell which would be struck as soon as Naivedyam for Tiruvengaḍamudayan was performed each noon. It was only after the hearing of this gong at Chandragiri that Sri Ranganatha Yadavaraya took his day&rsquo;s meal. Close to the Avachari Kōna there is the clephant path from the Chandragiri side for elephants to go to Tirumala.</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Within the last half a century many coffee hotels have sprung up along this ancient path to Tirumala The disadvantage is that the pilgrim has to pass endless rows of professional beggars all along the route Some fan you for a pie some sing your praise for a like amount There are men exposing to view their ugly sores some real and but many more faked There are fakırs resting their Here are beggars of all
body on pikes fixed into a plank of wood types and all ages If one has the patience one may make an interesting study of common ways in which the human mind works and the depths to which poverty can sink a human being Just before the Brahmotsavam, a regular caravan of these men gather on the hills The poor house feeding has been an additional attraction
The pilgrim who goes in a motor vehicle misses not only much of the beautiful natural scenery but also this study of human nature and its ways The old route is all exhilarating while the new motor route is all excitement, excitement caused by the too many hairpin bends and sharp curves At every turn one&rsquo;s attention is vetted on ones safety and stability rather than on the scenery even if

Long before Thupati had its birth, Tiruchchukanur(the modern Tiruchanur) was a village of importance during the centuries of Pallava and Chola rule It had a village council of Sabha, which managed the affairs of the Tirumala Temple also It is about 2 miles south of Tirupati and on the banks of the Swarnamukhi River The numerous spring channels excavated from tim to time along its bed served to keep up wet cultivation in this area It was practically the last point, on the old highway (Vadakkuvali), connecting the Tamil country of Tondamandalam with the region to the north of the Hills known as the land of the Vadugars But circumstances made it imperative that Tirupati should be made more important by artificial means,such as making it obligatory for anyone having any dealings with the Tuumala Temple to keep a house in Tirupati
Chandragiri is the next village to demand notice it came into existence, at any rate into notice, from the time of Saluva</li>

GEOGRAPHY-THE TIRUMALA HILL
Mangi Deva, the great grandfather of Saluva Narasimha and one of the Generals who served under the command of VirakumāraKempanna during the campaign launched to shatter the Sultanate of Madura This was in the second quarter of the fourteenth century It grew into a big town with its fortifications and Mahals as the fortified town of the Saluvas and the Vijayanagar Kings It has since shrunk in size and importance Where extensive mansions once stood there are green fields to-day The old fortifications, the moat and the Mahals are today only relics of their ancient glory The Railway station is about a mile to the north of the village The stories connected with the place will be referred to later
From the point of view of the Temple, it is the Tirumala Hill that should receive our attention in a larger measure The temple and the small village surrounding it are so situated that there are four recognised pathways leading thereto We have already referred to those from Tirupati and Chandragiri There is a third from Balupalli on the east (Mamandur Hill Road) from near the Mamandur Railway station The fourth is from Nagapatla side on the west There are other footpaths also such as the one from Karakamb idi, which played their part in the 18th century and the forest path connecting Talakōna on the extreme west of the Hill to the Tirumala Hill These can best be seen by a reference to the annexed map of the Hill
The Hill is but a part of the mountain range designated as the Eastern Ghats It may be taken to start from the Anamalais in the extreme south of the Madras state and to traverse the Coimbatore District, the eastern frontier of Mysore territory, through the Salem and the present North Arcot Districts, before entering the Chittoor District at Palamaner It takes a direction somewhat east of North upto the Talakona Water Falls, where there is a deflection towards the east till it reaches Tirumala To the east of Tirumala it ends in a gap through which the M &amp; S M Railway Broad gauge (NW) is laid The length of this bit of the Eastern Ghats may be taken to be about 12 miles between Talakona and Tirumala, as the crow flies The actual forest path along the
5HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
crest of the Hill may be about 20 miles. This portion seems to have been considered very holy from time immemorial. As evidence of this we see even today that the Kōna (water course) commencing from the Talakōna Falls on the extreme west is called the Papavinasam Kona. The water course on the eastern end is also called the Papavinasam Kona. This bit of the Hill, in spite of indiscriminate felling, is thickly wooded and contains valuable red saunders wood and other varieties used for building purposes. There are said to be rare herbs of medicinal value all over the hill and particularly in the ravines. The highest peak of the hill on the Talakōna side is 3,583 ft. above Mean Sea level. Nārāyanagiri Peak which is south-west of the Tirumala Temple is 3,622 ft. high.
The Talakona Falls and the Vagu seem to be the natural result of the wrench which the Hill was subjected to by the sharp turn from north to east. The level of the hill on the north is about 3,583 ft, east and south about 3,800 ft. The waterfall itself is at 2,650 ft. with a drop of 80 ft. The level country to the west of the hill, through which the Ry. line from Pākāla to Dharmavaram passes, is about 1,800 to 2,000 ft. above sea level. The hill has a sharp slope towards the plains. There is a Siddheswara temple on the plains and close to the hill on the west. This waterfall, being the first one on the hill, is known as the Talakōna Falls.
Intimately associated with the Temple of Tiruvengadamudayān are two kōnas on the Hill. One is called the Pāpavināsam (obviously the eastern one) and the other the Avachari vanka. The former drains the part of the Hill which may be said to be to the north of the Temple and the latter the part to the south, rather south-east, of it. Both are important on account of the many sacred Tirthams thereon.
THE PAPAVINASAM VANKA:-This Vanka has many rivulets as its feeders, draining the northern and the southern slopes. The annexed map will make this clear. Even otherwise the latitude, longitude and the height above M.S.L. shown hereunder will give an intelligent understanding of the course of the Vanka and the places where the sacred waters (Tīrthams) are met with. Many of these are rarely visited by the ordinary pilgrim.

The Hill here slopes from 3200 ft. to 2000 ft.
The most noteworthy ones are Tumburu Kōna, Ākāsa Ganga and Papavināsam.
Tumburukona is a very interesting water-fall in the east, more easily approached from Mamandur Railway Station. &ldquo;Here is a canyon into which the water precipitates itself and then flows along a smooth granite bed, with some extraordinarily deep circular pools at intervals, full of fish. The vegetation near the mouth of the entrance to the canyon is very dense and the scenery charming.&rdquo; The tradition is that many Rishis used to live there. It is now a favourite haunt for tigers and other wild beasts. At one spot there is a cave which is supposed to lead to a secret passage to the temple. But what is more worthy of notice is the tradition that when the idol of Sri Ranganatha was finally conveyed to Tirumala to avoid desecration by the iconoclastic Muslims during their invasion of the South in the early part of the 14th century, the idol is said to have been dropped down a deep ravine along</li>

with the bearer and to have been worshipped there for some time. There is said to be a small mantapam in the middle of the watercourse which may have been the place referred to in the tradition.
The Papanasam is a waterfall and pool about 3 miles from the temple. A bath there is supposed to cleanse one of all sins. The ensuring water is supposed to get discoloured in proportion to the intensity of the sins committed. Tradition has it that Sriman Tirumala Nambi used to fetch water from this place for the daily Tirumanjanam and worship of the God, until one day God tested the intensity of his devotion by appearing as a hunter and asking for some water to quench his thirst. When it was refused, he thrust an arrow and drank off all the water. The unsuspecting Tirumala Nambi found the pot empty when he reached the temple. But he found that the God had also received his Abhishekam. When next he went to fetch water the hunter told the old gentleman that there was an equally pure water source much nearer and shot an arrow which touched the spot, whence the Akasaganga began to flow. Since then water is said to be brought from this nearer source. Tradition connects both Akasa Ganga and Papavin sam. So pilgrims go invariably to bathe in both these places.
The Papavināsam Venka crosses the M. &amp; S. M. Railway line at about a mile south of Balupalli and 3 miles north of Mamandur Railway Station.
AVACHARI VANKA: This Vanka, at any rate, the southern confluence, takes its source from near the place where the old footpath and also the present motor road to Tirumala cross it. It runs practically eastwards and crosses the M &amp; S. M. Rly line (Broad gauge) after traversing Karakambadipalayam. It receives the waters from the Gogarbham and the Vaikuntha Tirtham and the north and from the Sesha Tirtham and Sitamma on the south.

These are the principal sacred waters on the Hill It will be observed from the map that as in the case of Talakōna Falls, even here the waterfalls have been ca ised by the contortions to which the Hill has been subjected by the twist towards NE on the Venkatagiri side The Tirthams are more numerous at the eastern end of the Hill But at both the west and the east ends the sacred waters go under the name &ldquo;Papavināsam&rdquo; This lends support to the traditional meaning attached to the term Vengadam as applied to this portion of the Hill, viz, that it burns away all sins (Papam) There are many legends which the puranas have concocted for the edification of the pious and credulous pilgrim
66
Before we take leave of the sacred Tirthams, we may as well notice a parallel in the case of the Ahobilam Hill Temple The hill there by some sudden twist sheared into two branches at a place very near to what is now known as JWALA NRISIMHAM As in the case of the Papavināsam canyon in Tirumala, there is a grand canyon there also whence the mountain 1ivulet known as &ldquo;Bhavanǎsanı&rsquo; emerges, whose source it is extremely difficult to approach The hill on either side has a deep vertical cut of several hundred feet depth The scenery is one of great beauty with ferns hanging in wreaths of long length On one side of this cliff there is a narrow foot path leading up to the small shrine called Jwala Nrisimham (already referred to) and there is a very cool trough of water close by Ascending to the top we have what is called Ukku Sthambham&rdquo; (Iron Pillar) set up by some unknown hand, which some women and men also perambulate to beget children It is considered a very sacred region There may be many more places like these all along the Eastern Ghats wherever the hill has been at some remote time in the past subjected to violent convulsions.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Tirumala Hill has had several other names given to it. These are Sesha Saila (or Seshachalam), Garudachala, Venkatadri, Nārāyanādri, Vrishabādri, Vrishādri, and Anjanādri. Each of these names is associated with some fable or other which in these days of enlightened views on religion need not be dwelt on at length. Some of these will however be referred to while dealing with old traditions relating to the sanctity of the Hill. In the inscriptions the hill is referred to only as Vengadam of Tiruvengadam down to the 15th century A.D.
Topography of the Tirumalai Temple.
The earliest notion of the topography of the place where the Mula Murti or Dhruva Beram was found standing (for He was not installed by any human hand), was that He was on the summit of the Hill or Ucchi. This has to be inferred from the words used in Silapadhikaram:-
64
வேங்கடமென்னும் ஓங்குயர் மலையத் துச்சிமீமிசை&rsquo;
It must have been due to this notion that He was also named Uchchiyilninrän&quot; (He who stands on the summit). The rice measure for food offerings was also for several centuries known as the &ldquo;Uchchiyilninrān-kāl&rdquo; (the Kal or kalam of Uchchiyil Ninran). This notion appears to have persisted, or was adopted as the legacy of tradition? till about the middle of the 13th Century A.D. Owing to a better knowledge of the topography of the hills surrounding the temple, the realisation that the temple was actually on a much lower level than its surroundings became more general in later days. For we find in the middle of the 14th century that the processional deity had been styled &ldquo;Malai kuniya Ninran &quot; standing where the hill bowed low and the grain measure was also renamed Malai Kuniya Ninrän-Kal. We have no means of knowing whether the capacity of the new measure was any different from that of the old. The Hill Temple measure was however always different from that used in the Tirupati Temple which was once called Arumolidevan and subsequently Chalukya Nārāyanan-käl. Although the term &ldquo;Malaikuniya Ninran &quot;
10
TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
appears in the inscriptions only from 1354 A.D. we have every reason to believe that the real low level of the temple floor was known at least two centuries earlier. This assertion is made from the fact that one of Periya Nambi&rsquo;s disciples had the surname &ldquo;Malai Kuniya Ninran&rdquo; which must have then been one of the appellatories of the God in Tirumala. Periya Nambi himself was one of Sri Alavandar&rsquo;s disciples and his birth is taken to be in 937 A D. Malaıkuniya Ninran&rsquo;s birth would have been some time in 980-90. It is not unlikely that he took part in the construction of the skeleton temple, when it must have been felt that the level was lower than the surroundings and that effective drainage arrangements were necessary. That may account for the surname he got
To the north of the Temple the hills rise to 3426 ft. where there is a trigonometrical station. A little further near the Jabali Tirtham the levei is 3177 ft., to the east the hills rise from about 2250 to 2750 ft, to the south to 2920 ft and in the south west the Nārāyanagiri rises to 3620 ft. These figures will give an idea of the hollow in which the temple is situated No wonder that the place has been malarial For water supply the small village around the temple depends on the pond called Alvar Tīrtham, which receives its supply from the surrounding country and the subsoil springs A tank called &lsquo;Murtinayakan Cheruvu&rsquo; on the hill to the north-west has so porous a bed that it retains very little water. The construction of a reservoir by damming up a part of the Papavinasam Kōna and conveying water therefrom by conduits has now been undertaken.
The drainage of this low lying village of Tirumala (the Temple in particular) is an urgent problem, not less than that of fresh water supply
11
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
TOPOLOGY.
This short account of the topography will be incomplete without its complement topology. It is therefore being dealt with in brief. As a matter of fact, topology has been in no small measure responsible for the immunity which this temple enjoyed, while almost all the others in South India were desecrated by the merciless hand of the Muslim invader. So long as the fate of the country depended on the rivalry and mutual jealousy of the Hindu rulers, there was no question of the interests of the temple being affected adversely, whoever became the ruler. We shall see from the inscriptions that each successful invader contributed his own share to the prosperity of the temple. The manner in which the topography of the country and the Hills made invasions by men of alien religious faith affect the fortunes of this temple will have to be briefly reviewed here. The success in this direction was also in no small measure attributable to the sagacity and ready wit of the people of Tirupati and those in the direct management of the temple. The quickness with which they comprehended the psychology of the alien invaders and the readiness with which they dangled before them a recurring revenue from the temple made the invaders realise that it was better not to cut the udder that yields an unfailing supply of milk.
It is worth repeating here that the Eastern Ghats enter the Kangundi Zamindari in the south-west of the district, and passing northwards gradually bend towards the east as far as the Tirupati Hills. Here the range is broken by a long valley which passes northwards into the Cuddapah district by the villages of Karakambādi and Mamandür. The M. &amp; S. M. Railway (N.W. line) passes through this gap. East of the Mamandur valley, the Ghats once more rise, and follow a north-easterly course until they enter the Nellore district from the Kalahasti Zamindari. This range of the hills separates the Balaghat or Mysore plateau from the Payan Ghat or the low country.
Numerous passes lead from the lowlands to those above the ghats. The three more important ones are the Kallur, the Mogili and the Saiyana Gunta passes. The Karakambadi pass on the
12
TOPOLOGY
eastern end is the fourth which assumed historical importance in the 18th century. There is also the Nagapatla ghat road leading to Bhākarapet which has some importance. All these can be seen on the annexed map of the Hills. These passes afforded facilities for invaders. The fortunes of the temple were not affected adversely until the Damalcheruvu Pass and the Karakambidi Pass gave opportunities for the invaders to gain access to Chandragiri and Tirupati.
The Kallur pass in the Chandragiri Taluk runs along the Dāmalcheruvu valley and through Kallurpalayam to the Piler Taluk. The Trunk road from Madras to Cuddapah runs along this route.
The Mogili Pass is in the Chittoor Taluk and through it passes the road from Madras to Bangalore. The rise of the ghat is gradual. The Saiyanagunta Pass leads from Gudiyattam to Palamaner, where it joins the road from Mogili. The ascent is steep. The old route to Bangalore via Nayakkaneri Ghat on the western borders of Gudiyattam taluk is too steep.
Malik Kafur&rsquo;s invasion of Southern India in 1310 A.D., although it carried fire and sword as far as south Rameswaram, did not in the least affect the Tirumala Hills and the surrounding country. Nor did the changing fortunes of the Chōlas, Pandyas, the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar Kings make any difference to the prosperity of Tirumala. Things however took a disastrous turn after the overthrow of the Vijayanagar Kingdom in the battle of Talikota in 1565 A. D. As the result of a treaty between Shah Jehan (the Emperor of Delhi) and the Bijapur Sultan, Vellore passed into the hands of Bijapur and Chandragiri was acquired by Golkonda in 1636 A.D. The next adventurer to these parts was Sivaji, who as the result of an arrangement with the Sultan of Golkonda, made an expedition into the Carnatic to recover from his brother Venkāji the possession he got from their late father Shahji. He entered the Carnatic by the Kallur Pass in 1676 A.D. and captured Vellore, Arni and even Gingee. But he had to retrace his steps on an urgent call from his ally, the Golkonda Sultan. Sivaji proclaimed himself king in 1674 A.D. In 1684
13
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
A.D., we find an envoy of his turning up in Tirumala as a devotee, and offering not cash, but a gold kanthi for an endowment. Sivaji died soon after and Gingee was also retaken by Aurangazib&rsquo;s General, Zulfikar Khan in 1694 A.D.
Passing over the intervening period of history, we find Raghoji Bhonsle advancing in 1740 to the head of the Ghats and ready to descend along the Kallur Pass. Dost Ali opposed him at a spot in Damalcheruvu where the hills close in and an embankment across was got repaired for effecting the defence. Raghoji defeated the Muslim and slew his son. Raghoji is said to have retired from the Carnatic with a crore of rupees, representing one year&rsquo;s revenue. We know that Raghoji endowed Srinivasa with some very costly jewels which are still in existence. The turmoil in the Carnatic had as one of its results the assignment of the revenues of the Tirumala Temple to the British Government in Madras. In 1753 an audacious adventurer by name Muhammad Kamal marched to Tirupati from Nellore (where he was engaged in pillaging and plundering) and the British got alarmed at the prospect of their losing the revenues from Tirupati. He was, however, captured and executed after a fight on the plains of Tirupati. Muhammad Kamal must have come by the Karakambadi Pass.
In 1757 the Maharatta General, Balavant Rao crossed the plateau of Mysore, and camped at Kadapanattam, at the head of the Kallapulla ghat in Palamaner Taluk. He did not however turn his army against Tirupati, but scoured Vaniyambadi, Ambur and Vellore. In the same year a party of Mahāratta horsemen under the command of Gopal Rao came down the Kallur Pass to Damalcheruvu and demanded of the British two lakhs of rupees as compensation on some grounds. When this was refused he is stated to have diverted his attention to Tirumala to plunder the Temple. This however is hard to believe. He might have paid his obeisance and made some presents also. What was more likely is that the British who had called for his help would not reimburse him for his waiting when they found his help unnecessary. He would naturally have gone up to the Sthanattar, narrated the perfidy and secured from their hands, willingly perhaps, one year&rsquo;s revenue which was due to the British. Subsequently when the
14

revenue was demanded they might have told the British that Gopal Rao plundered the temple. The true history of this temple can be written only after a careful study of the old records.
In August 1757 one Nazibulla visited the fort of Salava and threatened to take away the offerings made by pilgrims during the next Brahmotsavam. As the revenues of Tirupati were assigned to the British, they sent a detachment of the army to Tirupati to make sure of their revenue. But Nazibulla turned back as many pilgrims as he can, after perhaps divesting them of their belongings. In 1758 another brother of the Nabob, Abdul Wahab, made another bid for the wealth of the Temple. But the English were careful enough to foil this attempt. He however took possession of the fort of Chandragiri and waited for an opportunity. Bussy on his way back from Hyderabad halted at Tirupati and wrested from the lessee of the temple the year&rsquo;s revenue, while Nazibulla from Neilore and Abdul Wahab from Chandragiri helped him in this (October 1758).
The Maharatta Chieftain Gopal Rao who had been called back urgently by Balaji Rao left behind his Captain Narayana Sastri, who stayed at Karakambadi. In July 1759 with the help of the Palegar, he ascended the Tirumala Hill and reoccupied the temple. The English sent 300 sepoys and 15 Europeans. But it was found that only about 80 sepoys belonged to the castes which are permitted to ascend the hills. These went up and &ldquo;there was hard fighting before the temple and many lost their lives on both sides.&rdquo; A second reinforcement was sent. But even this contained mostly men who cannot ascend the hill so the English Commander Major Calliand attacked Karakambādi village instead and consigned it to the flames. Narayana Sastri had to retreat. The renter of the temple was reinstated by the English. The renter during these years under the Nawab of Arcot, the French and the English successively was one Dorai Srinivasachari who considered it a sacred duty to outbid muslim competitors with the main object of preventing a muslim from having an opportunity to ascend the Hill.
15HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
When the Second Mysore War broke out in 1779, and Hyder drew a belt of destruction from Pulicat in the North to Pondicherry in the south and another belt of about a dozen miles radius round Vellore, sacked and burnt everything inside these limits (Hyder Kalabham). Colonel Bailie was asked to hasten from Guntur via Kalahasti and Tirupati. The Colonel considered this route dangerous and went by a route nearer to the coast. Thus Tirupati and Tirumala were saved from fire and sword.
After the battle of Sholinghur in 1781 and prior to the seige of Vellore in 1780-81, Hyder was in person at the Kallur Ghat to intercept supplies of grain going to the English at Vellore and was helped by the Zamindars of Kalahasti and Karvetnagar in this. The Poligars also were in league with him. So Tirumala and Tirupati were left undisturbed. Muhammad Ali&rsquo;s brother handed over Chandragiri to Hyder. During the whole of 1781, although Sir Eyre Coote was within easy marching distance of Chandragiri he never did so. It was in the possession of Abdul Wahab. Coote does not appear to have been aware of its importance. In 1782 Hyder redeemed the fort of Chandragiri and sent Abdul Wahab as prisoner to Seringapatam. Hyder died at Narasingarayanpet near Chittoor, where his tomb remains to this day. It is indeed strange that he never allowed his men to ascend the Tirumala Hill or to plunder the temple.
In 1791 Lord Cornwallis (Governor General) himself took command of the army in the Third Mysore War against Tippoo and feigning to ascend the Mysore plateau by the Nayakaneri Ghat, diverted his march at the last moment and passed through the Mogili Ghat.
On 31st July 1801, the whole of the Carnatic passed into the hands of the English. But the poligars of the Chittoor District continued to give trouble. These were driven into the jungle, but they continued to harass and plunder pilgrims going to Tirupati. The roads leading to Tirupati had to be regularly patrolled by a body of sepoys. Even martial law had to be proclaimed against the insurgent poligars.

The Tirumala temple passed into the hands of the English for direct management in 1801. The Moyne Japta of that period will show to what meagre rations the daily food offerings to Sri Venkatesa had been reduced at the time.
All these incidents are mentioned in a sketchy manner to show that the sanctity of the Temple and the Vengadam Hill was fully respected by the Muslims and the English alike in spite of the fact that the topography of the Hills was such that military operations were carried on time after time within a few hours&rsquo; march of the temple and right at the foot of the Hill itself. This topology of Vengadam looks like a fairy tale and adds considerably to the topolatry of everything connected with the Hill and the Temple. History tells us more than all the fables depicted in the numerous Puranas. What impression of sanctity this unique immunity from desecration would have created in the whole of South India, and even in the Deccan South of the Vindhyas, can best be imagined.
There is, however, another side to this picture which we cannot afford to ignore. The traditional sanctity of the Hill and the Deity thereon had perforce to be preserved by payment of an annual subsidy of about two lakhs of rupees every year. The old system of management of the temple seems to have gone out of use and a renter was appointed by the Nawab of Arcot to collect the revenues of the temple. The last we hear of the existence of Sthanattär was in an inscription dated 19th March 1684 in Telugu language and script, when Raja Sri Sivaraja Ramachandra Yadamātara Dabirsa and Timmanayyangar made an endowment by payment of a gold kanthi and not cash. From another inscription dated 15-6-1638 we find that Sri Rangaraja Maharaya (with all the old Prasastis of the Vijayanagar Kings) was considered the ruling sovereign. These inscriptions are in Telugu which is the language of the country. We also find from the history of South India that as the result of a treaty between Shah Jahan and the Sultan of Bijapur in 1636, Bijapur and Golkonda became more independent and that by the year 1656 Vellore passed into the hands of Bijapur, while Golkonda secured Chandragiri. In the inscription
2
17
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
dated 16-3-1684 the Sthanattar do not mention any one as the ruler of the country, which only means that they did not choose to recognise the Sultan of Golkonda.
When Asaf Jah set himself up as the Nizam of Hyderabad effectively in 1724, Daud Khan was appointed by him as Nawab of the Carnatic. The Tirumala temple would in consequence have come under his sway. It must have been from about this date (1724 A.D.) that an arrangement was made by which the Tirumala Temple had to pay every year two lakhs of rupees to the Nawab as subsidy. There was no molestation of the temple as a result. We find mention of this source of revenue when in 1753 Muhammad Kamal marched to Tirupati to plunder the temple and the British had to send a detachment to ward off the attack, since the revenues of the temple were assigned to the English under some arrangement between them and the Nawab.
How was this amount to be made up every year? The renter had to devise a scheme for realising the amount and earn some more for his services. A levy was made on pilgrims who resorted to the temple. Before bathing in the waters of the Alvar Tirtham and the Swami Pushkarani, every pilgrim had, according to custom to recite certain verses in Sanskrit which a Brahmin purohit would do. This right to dictate the mantrams was leased out and the lessee levied a fee per head. So also when according to custom a pilgrim wanted to have his head shaved in Tirumala. When camphor had to be lighted a fee of one rupee was levied. For attending Archana a fee of seven rupees and so on for every item of worship. When an ornament or cloth was presented to the deity for perpetual wear, an amount equal to the value of the article had to be paid. This is called Vartana. When a food offering was made by a pilgrim, an amount equal in value to the offering had to be deposited in addition to the cost of the food offering. Through all the centuries down to about &lsquo;1750, we hear in the inscriptions no other sacred waters on the Hills excepting Akasaganga and Pāpavināsam. Several new ones were made sacred and legends extolling the sanctity of each had to be manufactured.

Near the Gögarbham Tirtham there is a round stone known as &ldquo;Kshetra Pāla &quot; about which there is no mention in any of the inscriptions. It was made a place of great sanctity for settling. disputes. Oath was administered at this place before lighted camphor to swear to truth and a fee (heavy enough) had to be paid to the temple to be allowed to do this. An iniquitous system for which there is neither traditional, sastraic nor moral sanction, was sedulously cultivated, which benefited the renter, the Nawab and perhaps a few of the temple functionaries. When in 1801 the temple passed entirely into the hands of the Court of Directors in England, this system was continued in its entirety. The renter system was abolished and direct management stepped in. The system which the English inherited from the Nawabs is told in full in an article published in the Asutic journal for 1831 which is given as an appendix. The Gazetteer published in 1847 (Pharoah &amp; Co., Madras) states: &ldquo;The Brahmins maintain that the Hindu Princes allowed the revennues from this source to be entirely expended on the spot in religious ceremonies and that the Mussalmans first appropriated the produce to their own use. During the early wars between the English and the French nations in India, this source of revenue was one of the first fruits of British conquest.&rdquo; How much revenue the English Government derived from 1804 to 1843 when in the latter year they had reluctantly to pass on the administration to a still more hungry Mahant, we have never been told. When the Mahants were cleared out and the T. T. Devasthanams Committee stepped in, the iniquitous system was continued as before, nay the rates were revised to bring in more revenue. The concomitant evils of subordinates influencing pilgrims in all manner still continues. Is it not time that this enforced levy of fees for worshipping God is removed and voluntary contributions are made the rule? There will then be less of corruption and more freedom of worship for the penniless man and the multi millionaire alike. We may scan the published inscriptions from end to end and fail to find even a scrap of evidence, direct or inferential, to show that at any time before the temple passed into the hands of Muslims there was any levy of fees for offering worship in the manner a pilgrim desired to do.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The instructions issued by Lord Clive in 1800 A.D. to the Nawab of Arcot in connection with the arrangements to be made for affording conveniences to Rajah Raghottama Rao, one of the principal ministers of H. H. the Nawab Nizam-ul-Doulah Asafjah Bahadur of Hyderabad, during his pilgrimage to Tirumala are worth repeating in this connection. They will clearly show that pilgrims were subjected to compulsory levies and were harassed. Raja Sri Mysore Tirumal Rao was deputed on behalf of the British Government to perform the duties of hospitality as if Lord Clive himself was present. The temple was then under the full control of the Nawab of Arcot.
&ldquo;(1) All offerings of dresses or jewels which may be made by the said Raja to the Deity must be preserved in the wardrobe of the Pagoda dedicated to Balaji; and no person must prevent the Deity from being arrayed and decorated with the said dresses and jewels.
(2) You must not appropriate any part of the offerings which may be made by the Raja to the Deity.
(3) The said Raja must not experience any kind of molestation or interruption in his devotional visits or in the festival ceremonies in compliment to the Deity.
(4) You must select and allot a commodious and suitable habitation for the said Raja and his followers.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is likewise ordered that you do not demand any duty or custom either from the Raja or any of his followers but consider them totally exempted from the same and treat them with utmost politeness.&rdquo; Lord Clive agreed with the Nawab of Arcot that he would himself bear the customs duties etc.
After his pilgrimage Raja Raghottam wrote on 29-9-1800 to Lord Clive thanking him for all the kindness shown and added &ldquo;Raja Sri Tirumal Rao will communicate with you on the subject of pilgrims, and if you should be so good as to arrange the business, it would be beneficial to the Sarkar and the pilgrims.&rdquo; This extract delicately gives us a picture of the difficulties which pilgrims had to undergo in offering worship. All the factors which contributed to the growth of such difficulties still exist.

The Sanctity of the Vengadam Hills
and the antiquity of Tiruvengadamudayan.
the last chapter, it was discussed how the sanctity of the Vengadam Hills and of the Deity presiding was preserved by those charged with that task during the period of the Muslim incursions and thereafter. We have now to enquire how and when this sanctity came into existence. Many are the legends connected with this and not one of these has any historical basis. We have known the well tried and familiar method which our ancient Rishis pursued in making the aspirant realise the &ldquo;Absolute Truth or Brahman.&rdquo; It consisted in a graded process of &lsquo;Neti&rsquo; or elimination of what it is not. We have similarly to examine the legends to realise that they do not present the truth. Then something more appealing to the intellect and the heart has to be sought for.
Sanctity of the Hill-Legends.
Legends dealing with the sanctity of the Hill are distinct from those which deal with the sojourn of Vishnu from Srivaikuṇṭam (His heavenly abode) to this Hill. We will first refer to those relating to this Hill.
(1) It appears that in the last Krita Yuga, there lived on the Hill a Rakshasa by name Vrishabhäsura who did great penance near the Tumburu Kōna waters on the Hill. When Sri Vishnu appeared to him and wanted to know his desires, he said that he did not care to receive any boon from Hari, but that he wished to have a direct fight to see who was more powerful. In the end, the Asura had to be killed only by making use of the &ldquo;Sudarsana Chakram.&rdquo; Since then, the Hill came to be known as Vrishabhāchalam. Brahmänḍapurānam is said to be the authority for this.
21
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
(2) In the Tretayuga, there lived a lady by name Anjanādevi in the country round Pampa Saras (in the present Hampi of the Bellary District). Being childless, she did great penance on this Hill and the God of winds, Vayu appeared to her and blessed her with a child who was Hanuman or Anjaneya. So the Hill got the name Anjanachalam or Anjanädri.
(3) In the Dwapara Yuga, when Sri Vishnu was with Sri Lakshmi and not-at-home to any one, the wind-God Vayu tried to enter the room which Sesha (Adi Sesha, the serpent who is His constant attendant) was guarding. The Wind-God was prevented from entering. This resulted in a commotion and Sri Vishnu himself was not able to settle the quarrel. They wanted to test who was the more powerful. Adi Sesha wound himself round Mount Meru and covered the mountain with his thousand-headed hood. Vayu began to blow fiercely with the result that the inhabitants of the three worlds felt considerably distressed. So they approached Adi Sesha and represented to him that the immediate reaction of their power test was disastrous to all others. To mitigate this, they requested Adi Sesha, as the more amiable of the two, to just lift one of his thousand heads for a second. He did this and lo! a portion of Mount Meru was blown away. And that bit alighted on the earth as our Tirumala Hill. So it came to be known as &ldquo;Seshachalam&rdquo; since then. If this were true, the legends of the Krita and Treta yugas would be chronologically impossible.
(4) In the Kali yuga, our own age, there lived in Kalahasti, a very pious and learned Brahmin by name Purandara Sōmayāji, who after doing penance was blessed with a son, named Madhava who although as learned as the father, was lustful. He took a fancy for a chandala woman who was addicted to all conceivable vices and was to boot a whore. This Madhava gave up all rules of caste and lived with her happily for twelve years on the banks of the Krishna. When she died, he became, crazy, roamed about and followed a party of kings who were on their pilgrimage to Tirumala. When he went up the Hill and stood along with the others in front of the temple (or God, we are not sure), a horrible stench arose from his body and all the Devas came there to find
22
TOPOLOGY
out why. All of a sudden, there shot up a fire enveloping his body and his sins were all burnt away. So the Hill came to be known as Venkatachalam (the Hill which burns away all sins). But great Sanskrit scholars have not even to this day been able to derive this meaning etymologically for the word Venkata. It was prophesied or blessed that this Madhava would be reborn as the illegitimate son of a Chola King and would rule over Tondai Mandalam. Vamana Purana seems to be responsible for this story.
To make all these legends improbabilities, there is another legend which says that Sri Venkateswara made this Hill his habitation on a day 28 Mahayugas before the present one of which Kali is the last Yuga. One Maha Yugam(according to the Purānās) is equivalent to 43,20,000 Mänava years and 28 such Maha Yugas have passed since Sri Vishnu came over to Tirumala, i.e., 7,77,60,000 Mänava years.
This is said to be mentioned in the Varaha, Vāmana, Bhavishyottara, Brahma, Brahmanda and Padma Purānas.
Legend as to why Sri Vishnu came over here.
It appears that Bhrigu Maharshi who wanted to see how each of the Trimurtis was performing His duties, came over, after testing Brahma and Siva, to Sri Vishnu. He found the Lord in a posture of repose sporting with his consort. The Rishi could not bear the sight of the Deity, whose duty it was to protect His creation by keeping constant watch, sporting with his consort. So he gave a kick on His chest and that part of the chest happened to be the portion which was Sri Lakshmi&rsquo;s resort. Sri Vishnu enquired of His Bhakta whether on account of the kick, the Rishi&rsquo;s feet had received any injury or pain. Lakshmi got infuriated with her Lord for not punishing the Rishi for his misdemeanour, but trying to pacify him. So She left Sri Vishnu, who in turn left Sri Vaikuntam and came over to Tirumala as the best spot on earth where He could spend his time. One day He chanced to sight a fair lady sitting on, or born of the flower Lotus, (Padmam, f) and wished to marry her. She was the foster-daughter of the pettyruler of Narayanavanam, Akasa Raja (in Puttur Taluk of this District). Being penniless, he had to borrow a large sum of money
23
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
for marriage expenses and dowry, form Kubera, the God of Wealth. He has been to this day repaying it in annual instalments to the rulers of the land till the British Government left the management of the Temple in the hands of the Mahants of Tirupati.
Then there is the story that the first Temple of Sri Venkateswara was built by one Tondaiman Chakravarthi who was the ruler of this part of the country in the early years of the Kali Yuga. The surmise of historical research workers is that the first Chola King of Tanjore, Karikala, had an extra-marital connection with a Naga Princess; and the offspring was one Aḍondai, who founded Tondaimandalam and was known as Tonḍaiman Chakravarthi. Before he built the temple, the Deity was covered over by an ant-hill and cows used to go to the top of the ant-hill and automatically empty the milk from the udder. It was only when this phenomenon was noticed that the ant-hill was opened out and the discovery made. So according to this story of the Brahmanda Purāṇa, Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan&rsquo;s existence was discovered only in Chola Karikala&rsquo;s time, somewhere about the first century A.D. As against this, there is the statement in the North Arcot District Gazettee (1894) that there was a record preserved in the temple of the benefactions of various Kings of the past. The earliest entry showed that the second (inner) enclosure wall (Prakaram) was built by Parikshit Maharajah, and the outer enclosure wall (outer prakara) by his son Janamējaya. Vikramarka Maharaja made several improvements six centuries later. But according to the other legend the temple itself is said to have been built later on by Tondaiman Chakravarthi, son of Karikala.
There is also another book of fables called Venkatachala Mahatmyam, which came into being on palm leaves in 1491 A.D., and the author of which was one Pasindi Venkaṭatturaivar (a Brahmin Brahmachari doing service in the temple). It was allowed to be read in the temple with arulappadu (divine permission). Later it used to be read off and on at the request of donors. But after the middle of the 16th century, it seems to have gone out of use. We have nothing to show what really were the stories of fables included in that compilation. It is common knowledge how the readings in the Puranas used to get corrupted from time to
24
TOPOLOGY
time and from place to place. To the writer&rsquo;s knowledge, an important palm-leaf work dealing with Yatidharmam (the rules of Sanyasam), kept in the Fort St. George about 60 years ago was tampered with by some eminent pandits. There is a common saying applicable to all Puranic stories which runs thus in Tamil &ldquo;Indappoy Kandattilumillai&rdquo; (u)&ldquo;This lie is not even in Skanda Puranam.&rdquo;
Taking up the thread where we left off saying that the Mahants stepped into the shoes of the East India Company as the lawful heirs of Kubera to collect dues from the God of Tiruvengadam, we find further developments in the legend. The Mahants were not the rulers of the land. Also the God stood only as the debtor discharging his debts in instalments. There must be more substantial ground to stand upon. The legend was coined that Sri Venkateswara played at dice with a great bhakta by name Hattiram Bhāvāji, who is presumed to have come to the Hill some time about 1500 A.D. Sri Venkateswara was pleased to lose the game every time. He first placed the temple itself as bet and lost. Lastly being at a loss to find anything else, He played His own Self as bet and losing the game became the servant of Sri Hattiram Bhāvāji. That was adduced as the reason why in 1843, the East India Company had to hand over the God, the Temple and all that it contained to one of Hattiramji&rsquo;s disciples, Sevadasji. So the position of creditor and debtor was changed to one of master and servant. God has always been the most obedient servant of His Bhaktas. This fable was started probably in the first edition of the Venkatachala Mahatmyam in print. To make this fable go about the country, several editions were prepared, Sanskrit text in Telugu script (1884), Sanskrit Text and Devanagari script (1887), Telugu Text (1896), Devanagari Script published in Bombay (1904), lastly Devanagari Script Sanskrit Text and Hindi Translation (1930). The last one contained pictures, the front page one being Sri Venkateswara playing at dice with Hattiram Bhāvāji. To this last edition and its illustrations, an eminent Sanskrit scholar lent his name.
Regarding the unreliability of palm leaf and other works claiming antiquity and therefore truth, there are two which come
25HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
to our notice. One is mentioned in the North Arcot Gazetteer (P. 325),&rdquo; an old palm leaf book in the possession of one of the village-officers of Chandragiri &quot; which stated that the Chandragiri Fort was originally built by one Immadi Narasinga Yadavarāyulu, one of the Kings of Nārāyanavanam in this district (999 A.D.). He (Immaḍi Narasinga) &ldquo;proceeded to Tirupati in order to visit the God and after accomplishing his object set about building palaces on the hills parallel to Seshachalaparvatam in sight of which he always wished to dwell.&rdquo; Mr. Cox, the compiler of the Gazatteer then goes on to say that the ruins of the buildings upon the Adḍakonda Hill including a small fort are still in existence. Then Mr. Cox recites a story that a kite carried off the Rajas red turban mistaking it for a piece of flesh and dropped it on the Chandragiri Hill. Finding this to be a very good spot and a good omen, he built a fort and founded the city. correct according to the inscriptions in Sriranganatha Yadavaraya who after the troublous period of Muslim invasion of the South by Malik Kafur and Muhammad Tughlak, finally wanted to rest his war-weary frame in Tirumala and built a palace thereon about the year 1359 A.D. But the founding of Chandragiri and the first building of the Fort has been recognized as the act of Saluva Narasinga Dēva Uḍaiyar and not Immaḍi Narasinga Rayalu of Narayanavanam. Saluva&rsquo;s grand-father, Mangideva, may have shifted his capital from Kalyanapuram to Nārāyanavanam sometime about 1370 A. D. Saluva Narasinga Deva only built the fort circa 1450 A.D.
Part of the story is Tirumala. It was
The palm leaf goes on to say that ten of the Yadavarāyas ruled for 314 years after Immaḍi Narasinga and then the Vijayanagar dynasty took their place. The story told is that one Venkatapati Naidu who was left to guard the gate surrendered to Krishna Devarayalu, on a demand made by him through a messenger. So it was in (999 plus 314) 1313 A.D. that Krishnadevaraya should have occupied the Chandragiri Fort, whereas according to history, he ascended the Vijayanagar throne only in 1509 A.D. In a further portion of the story Venkatapatideva Maharayar is stated to have died in Chandragiri on the new moon day of Bhadrapada in the year Nandana. This must be equivalent to 1592 A.D. in which year must have commenced his reign.

The other book of some facts and more fables and untruths is the Itihasa Mala on which Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar based some reliance, but soon found that it defied facts and historical dates. This book relates mainly to the activities of Sri Ramanuja. Palm leaf books have been more successfully tampered with than would be possible with printed books.
The criticism levelled against legends does not however give an answer to the enquiry how and when the Hill came to be considered sacred. Silappadhikram (756 A. D. according to Dr. Swamikannu) does not tell us that the Hill was sacred, nor does it say when the God manifested himself there. It was only the Alwars that have sung the glory of the Hili and the God. The Hill has been considered in still later periods as the body of Adisesha and therefore called Seshachalam. The earliest of the Alwars may have lived not earlier than the 5th or 6th century A.D. As will be pointed out later, when faced with the spread of Buddhism and Jainism, they were put to the necessity of postulating a God and a religion which was neither rank Saivism nor rank Vaishnavism. Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan was thus represented as the only True God who combines in Himself all the Murtis, rather the Para-Vasu deva of the Pancharatnas and the Adi Murti of the Vaikhānasas. Who then can fix the date of his Birth? The Hill came to be depicted as Adi Sesha who is ever attendant on Him. Being so sacred many of the Alwars, according to later tradition, abstained from ascending the Hill. to worship Him and Sri Ramanujā has been credited with having ascended the Hill on his knees may be all a fable. None of the Alwars has stated that the Hill represents the body of Adi Sesha. The later day tradition seems to have been coined to explain the omission of the image of Sesha in Sanctum. We find Nammalwar&rsquo;s shrine at the Alwär Tirtham where the pilgrim takes his purificatory bath,and Periyalwar shrine is stationed at the place where the pilgrim commences his ascent of the Hill. These seem to have been started with a mystic or esoteric significance. The sanctity however consists entirely in the Murti being a Deity acceptable to all sects although the worship has always been according to the Vaikhanasa Agama,
27
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
bereft of some of its offensive sectarian aspects,1 and not the Pancharatra which Ramanuja followed and which he introduced in almost all the other Vishnu temples in South India. So even the Vaikhanasas felt satisfied Neither Sri Alavandar, nor Sri Ramanuja did instal any of the Vaishnavite Alwars or Acharyas inside the Tirumala Temple It was only to Sri Ramanuja that a shrine was allotted by common consent No further innovation was ever attempted Therein lies the superior sanctity of the Hill and its temple over all the other and older temples in South India
The reason assigned for this manifestation of Archavataram (form for idol worship) in the daily rituals is that He is Mayavı.2 His ways are inscrutable.
He left His Vaikuntam and came down to settle on the bank of the Swami Pushkarını, on this Hill. Nothing more is said.
The above sloka (verse) forms a part of the daily ritual called mantrapushpam. Seeing that the latter contains a verse wishing prosperity to Sri Nammalvar also, it may reasonably be presumed that the slokas were composed when the present form of worship was formulated soon after the installation of the silver Muiti now known as Bhoga Srinivasa in 966 A.D But it might reasonably be asked whether the bare statement contained in it, that the Supreme Being left Vaikuntam and took his abode in Tirumala without any reason being assigned can be accepted as truth when there are different stories in the Puranas implicitly believed by the public which assign different reasons for His manifestation here. The earliest reliable historical records are the devotional songs of the Alwars and the description given in the Silappadhikāram, and all these are in Tamil. Among these it is only Nammālvār</p>

who speaks of the sanctity of the Tiruvengadam Hill and explains the reason for the Supreme Being Paran (u) transferring His abode from the Heavens to this Hill. His mystic vision made him affirm that his statement (which obviously was also the current belief) embodies the Truth (wow). The etymological meaning of the word Vengadam (Coburn, and the fruits of past acts) is burning away the effect of all past Karmas. This Hill, he affirms, possesses that great virtue. So God selected this spot for His stay on earth. His decision to reside in Vengadam is according to Sri Nammālvār for the sole purpose of affording facilities to earthly beings to worship Him in the same manner as and along with the Heavenly Beings headed by Brahma who are said to be doing here daily what they have been doing in Vaikuntam. Here in Vengaḍam, after His sojourn to the place, the same Heavenly Beings share with us on equal terms the privilege of doing all manner of service which his bhaktas desire to do. Nammāļvār assigns a naïve reason for the sojourn of the Supreme Being by citing two typical instances. When dumb cattle who live to serve human beings with their milk were threatened with destruction by the fury of pelting rain and biting cold He as Sri Krishna lifted up a hill and held it over them to afford shelter. Again when one of the most highly evolved of human beings, Maha Bali, who was ideally just, truthful and charitable was very nearly losing his soul by his failure to conquer the self although he had conqueerd the worlds, the Lord out of his overflowing Love came unsolicited to save him by showing him that all his conquests and achievements fell far short of the small gift he was asked to make to the Lord. We in this Kali age stand between these two extreme instances. We are gifted with certain limited powers and with a desire to serve Him in the same manner as we are told that the Heavenly Beings (out) do in Heaven. As we cannot go there and serve Him with this material body the Supreme Being has for our special benefit come over to Vengadam saying good-bye to Heaven. Vengadam is Heaven, the Kaliyuga Vaikuntam. All this is attributed to the infinite and unaccountable love of God (his Pāsam, (um). Let us therefore go to Vengadam where our Karmas will be destroyed and where we can do service to him such as

bringing water for abhishekam, flowers for worship and dhupam (incense) and deepam (light) etc.
Nammāļvār does not refer to any Puranic story to account either for the sanctity of the Hill or for the manifestation of the Supreme Being on earth. His explanation is purely devotional mysticism.
Nammalvar&rsquo;s mysticism has been largely responsible for the form of worship which has been developed in the temple ever since Bhōga Srinivasa was installed. It was after listening to the exposition made by Sri Alavandar of the ten verses (of the 3rd ten of the 3rd centum) in Tiruvoimoli that his grandson Sri TirumalaNambi just past his teens, made a solemn resolve, took his grandsire&rsquo;s blessings and repaired to Vengaḍam where he dedicated his whole life to the daily service of Lord Venkatėsvara in the manner recommended by Nammālvār in his songs. The same verses when explained by Sri Ramanuja made Sri Anandālvär repair to the Tirumala Hill to keep company with Tirumala Nambi in doing service to the Lord. (These verses are given at the end of this Chapter).
There is also a story in Chapter V of Mausala Parva of Sri Mahabharata which may be taken to have some connection or throw some light on the manifestations of the Supreme Being on earth to give a start to a new form of worship known as Archavatāra. This form of worship supercedes the older ones, viz., Para, Vyuha, Vibhava and Antaryami and has been recommended by God Himself as the one best suited for us in the Kali Yuga. Sri Krishna while departing his human body in the manner described in the Mahabharata, exhibited to Brahma and the other Devas as well as Rishis, etc. His real form with four hands, and Sri Devi seated on his right breast. Without going into details it may be stated here that Brahma and the others addressed him as the one bearing the bow, obviously referring to his avatar as Sri Rama who killed Väli with the bow and who therefore paid for that act with his life as Krishna at the hand of Jara the hunter. The Divine Spirit ascended to the Heavens piercing the Solar Orb. There the spirit appeared to Brahma and the others as a stone

image and simultaneously a voice from the Heavens proclaimed that He would appear on earth in that shape, which while appearing to be stony and lifeless would possess considerable (spiritual) power, that He would remain on earth thereafter and that Brahma and the Devas should continue their worship there. This incident happened at the end of the Dvapara Yuga. At the commencement of the Kali Yuga His manifestation in Vengaḍam seems to have taken place. The Image has Sri Devi on the right chest. It shows scars on both shoulders extending to the arm pit as if they were due to the constant wear of the bow-string and the sling of the arrow pouch. There are no other weapons, not even the Sankham and the Chakram. What is known as Brahmārādhanam (worship by Brahma) accordingly takes place every night and that Tīrtham is served to worshippers the first thing in the morning during Visvarūpa sēva.1 The Deity was also invested with the bow during the days when Silappadhikaram was written.

CHAPTER III.
How the temple became popular and famous.
AN attempt was made in the last chapter to show that neither
the so-called Puranic accounts nor other legends can be trusted to explain when and why the God of Tiruvengaḍam manifested Himself on the Hill, and why the Hill itself came to be credited with the virtue of burning away all sins. It cannot, however, be doubted that the Hill was considered sacred and the Deity thereon more so. The fact that neither the Hill nor the Deity thereon is mentioned by name in the Itihāsas, the Vishnu Purana, Sri Bhāgavatam and the Bharatam does not militate against it. It was, however, rarely resorted to by pilgrims in ancient times.
So was and still is Ahobilam, to which among the Alwārs only Sri Tirumangai Alwar seems to have paid a visit. It was so inaccessible. It came into prominence during the period of the Sangama Dynasty of the Vijayanagar Kings and after the battle of Talikota again relapsed into obscurity. The writer knew personally the conditions that prevailed there about 35 years ago. There was no regular daily worship although the Temple is said to have been consecrated according to the Pancharatra Agama by the Ahobila Mutt Jiyars. There was a Niyogi Brahmin of the Cuddapah District doing puja voluntarily although he knew nothing of the Agama form of worship. He would make 108 pradakshinams after bath with his wet clothes on; then enter the temple, trim the lamp left burning overnight, ring the bell and offer to the Deity the water, flowers and Tulasi which he brought with him. He used to cook a small quantity of rice which he would first offer to God and then partake of it himself. This was for the Tiruvilankoyil God in the plains. Five miles away on the Hill is the real Ugra Narasimhaswamy partly in a rock-cut cave. There was no daily puja for Him. Once a week on Saturday the same Niyogi gentleman would go to the Hill, do abhishekam and offer the puja in the only simple style known to him. Outside the temple, and even
35HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
inside the Gopuram, animal sacrifice used to be made by the villagers making the waters of the Bhavanāsini stream (on whose banks the temple is situated) run red with blood. In spite of all these deficiencies, Sri Vaishnavas and all other Hindus too, consider the place sacred. The Brahmotsavam is attended by tens of thousands of pilgrims.
Tiruvengaḍam might have been in similar state in the earlier stages. Except for the Alwars singing its glory, there was nothing historically great about it. Epigraphical researches disclose that some Vishnu temples existed from unknown times and more were built from time to time and endowed by the Pallava Kings. What are known as the Charudevi plates go to show that among other things land-grant was made to Narayana of Kulimahātāraka temple at Dālūru (in Nellore District). There is also the Uravapalli grant in the eleventh year of the reign of Simhavarman (486 A.D.) to God Vishnuhara in Kandukuru (Nellore District). There is the Mahendravaḍi inscription (600-630 A.D.) showing that a cave temple called Mahendra Vishnu Simha temple was cut during the reign of Mahendravarma I, probably in Mahendravaḍi. During the same period, there is the Mandagappaṭṭu inscription mentioning the erection of a temple for Brahma, Vishnu and Iswara without the use of bricks, timber, metals and mortar. An inscription of the Pallavaram cave temple is of the same period. In Kanchipuram so many temples were built during Mahendravarma&rsquo;s and his successors&rsquo; time. During the eighth and ninth centuries A. D. also grants were made very near to Tirupati for the Siva and Vishnu temples as may be seen from inscriptions in Guḍimallam in Chittoor District, Tiruvallam (North Arcot District) and Tirumukkūḍal (Venkatesa&rsquo;s temple). These are not repeated here in extenso as we are not much concerned with the details. Among the donors are the Bana Kings (Māvali Vāna Rayas) one of whom Vijayāditya Banaraya is a donor for the Tiruchukanür Tiruvilankoyil about the closing years of the ninth century A.D. The absence of any inscription showing grant of land or relating to the construction of a temple on Tirumala cannot therefore be accounted for only by a simple statement that inscriptions were rare in those days as Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar would have
36
TEMPLE, ITS POPULARITY
us believe. It can be accounted for only by assuming that the Tirumala temple, although considered sacred, was not considered important. That must also have been the reason for having a Tiruvilankoyil in Tiruchukanür or a Venkatesa&rsquo;s Temple in Tirumukkudal in those early days.
But the necessity for a proper temple in Tirumala soon came to be realised and became an accomplished fact in the early years of the tenth century A.D.
The developments in temple worship, both Saivite and Vaishnavite, which led to this will now be considered. The period we are going to consider is anterior to the birth and growth of the philosophical sects known as the Advaita and the Visishtadvaita schools adumbrated by Sankara and Ramanuja and the Dvaita school of Madhva. The former lived, for all we know, in the first half of the ninth century A.D. and the latter, Ramanuja, in the eleventh and the first half of the twelfth century A.D. and Madhva lived much later. We have to deal with the period when Appar, Sundarar, Māņikkavāsagar and Tirugnānasambandhar were the great saints of the Siva cult and the Vaishnavite Alwars (twelve in number) stood for the new Vaishnava-cult, because we really have no means of knowing what definite form Vishnu worship took in anterior days. For one thing it does not appear to have been of the Bhakti type which the Alwars, and particularly, Nammalwär enunciated. There may have been the Vaikhanasa form of worship or some form of Pancharatra. But Pancharatra itself was presumably based on a rational and acceptable basis by Yamuna Muni or Alavandar in his Agama Pramanyam and later by Vedanta Dēsika in his Pancharatra Raksha. A glance at the Vaikhanasa Samhita will show how offensively Vaishnavite was the old type which made Brahma and Siva attendant beings waiting by the side of Vishnu, Siva in particular being placed in the Paisacha Zone. Or worship may have been of the haphazard type the writer described about Ahobilam. If we compare the description given in the Silappadhikaram about Srirangam and about Tiruvengaḍam, we have to conclude that there was regular worship in the presence of a congregation of worshippers so far as Srirangam was concerned,
37
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
whereas in the case of Tiruvengadam it would have been a mere dressing up of the form of the Deity. The words used in regard to Srirangam are &ldquo;Several worshipping with Sthotrams.&rdquo; There is no mention of a congregation of worshippers or of worship in regard to Tiruvengadam. The Sun and the Moon could well have shone on the Deity as he stood, according to the author&rsquo;s description.
The Siva cult was ruling in Kanchipuram in the fifth, sixth and seventh centuries A.D. and the competing religions were Jainism and Buddhism. Mahendravarma (600-630 A.D.) was a Jain before he was converted to Saivism by Appar (Tirunavukkarasu). During those days, according to the Chinese traveller Hieun Tsang, there were about 80 Hindu and Jain temples in and around Kanchi, and about 100 Sangharamas and 10,000 priests of the Mahayana sect. Kanchi was the birth place of Dharmapala, the well known metaphysician who was the head of the Nalanda University. This was the state of affairs when Hieun Tsang visited Kanchi in 642 A.D. In the Pandyan country also there were Buddhists but mostly given to commercial pursuits. It was also during the period of Narasimhavarma I, that Manavarma (of the Mahāvamsa of Ceylon) was in Kanchi seeking Narasimhavarma&rsquo;s help to regain the throne in Ceylon. In the Pandyan country, one Pandyan king Nedumaran was converted from Jainism to Saivism by Sambandar. This might have been about 760 A.D.
There was thus very keen rivalry, if not struggle b tween he heretical religions, Jainism and Buddhism, on the one side and the Vedic types, if we may use that term, of Hinduism represented by the Siva and the Vishnu cults on the other. The Siva cult seems to have been the stronger in the earlier stages. As regards Buddhism, Hieun Tsang himself felt despondent about its future as it was in a decaying state. So was Jainism. Mahendravarma in his Prahasana (farce) called &ldquo;Mattavilāsa&rdquo; (in Sanskrit) ridiculed the Kāpālikās, Sākhya Bhikshus and Pasupatās.</li>

38
VAISHNAVISM RIVALS SAIVISM
To comprehend fully the abuses that had crept into Buddhism Jainism and Saivism, we have to go a little more into details without unduly taxing the patience of the reader. The Mahayana Buddhism not only copied from Hinduism image worship, but had also developed all the Tantrik forms. Tāra, Vajra Yogini, Kshetrapāla were worshipped with the use of mantras, bijas and japa. The life led by the Sakhya Bikshus did not in any way maintain the good name of Buddhism. The Jains seem to have been held in no better esteem by the public. When Mahendravarma I (Pallava) and Nedumaran (Pandya) changed their faith from Jainism to Saivism it must have been a sad commentary on that religion. And Mahendra did not stop with that. He wrote the prahasana, severely ridiculing both Jainism and Buddhism. Further, both these religions were exotic in origin and no religious literature worth the name seems to have been produced in the language of the country (Tamii). Sanskrit had become a part of the recognised language and all Vedic literature, the Puranas etc., were also available in Tamil for the benefit of the common man. South India was in those days in close contact with Ceylon. Mänavarma of Ceylon had to flee from Ceylon to seek the help of Narasimha Varma to regain his throne, and was a refugee in Kanchi. The precepts of Buddhism were not being put into practice; and that was patent to the Hindus here.
The great protagonists of Saivism in this century (seventh) were Appar, Manikkavāsagar and Sambandar. They did yeoman&rsquo;s service in weeding out the exotic heretic religions. But did their work yield fruitful results? If it had done so, there would have been little chance for Vaishnavism (as we know it now) to gain acceptance.
These two, Saivism and Vaishnavism, are known as Vedio religions, because they start with an implicit faith in and acceptance of the Vedas, Upanishads, Srutis, Smritis, the Agamas, Itihāsas and the main Puranas. At the time we are dealing with, there was not a systematic evolution of the Advaita philosophy and much less of the Visishtadvaita system, nor of the Dvaita school. There were, no doubt, temples dedicated to Siva and Vishnu.
39
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Whether the rituals therein were being performed strictly according to the Saiva and the Vaishnava Agamas, we cannot definitely say. The Saiva Agamas may have been observed. As regards the Vaishnava Agamas, there were two Schools, the Vaikhānasā and the Pancharatra. It is likely that the former may have been in vogue before the Pancharatra became more popular. Historically there is nothing to guide us in the matter. There is however, a tradition among the Vaikhanasa Archakas that all the temples in the Tamil country-and it was the same in the Andhra country also were originally consecrated according to their own tenets. But in later times, it was Sri Ramanuja who converted one by one all of them to the Pancharatra system, which he favouredthe only exception being Tirumala. The legend is that a Srirangam Archaka, for performing his father&rsquo;s sraddha, invited Sri Ramanuja as the bhōkta and that at the end he declined to utter &quot; Truptōsmi (&ldquo;I am satisfied &ldquo;) unless the key of the temple was handed over to him, which was done. Having got hold of the key, Sri Ramanuja made them accept Pancharatra to govern the temple worship before handing back the key. Anyhow, there is the grievance of that community in the matter, although the story on the face of it looks improbable.
&quot;&rdquo;
What was wrong with the state of Saivism that made Vaishna vism to rear its head? The defect seems to have been in the ugly forms which the Tantrik form of worship assumed. Temple worship which has been enjoined for the Kaliyuga is inextricably mixed up with the Tantrik rituals, whether the temple is of Vishnu or Siva. In the latter, there is Siva worship and Devi or Sakthi worship. They are not in two water-tight compartments. Whichever is the Ishţa Devata for the specific purpose the appropriate Tantra for propitiation is adopted. The one that came in for the greatest amount of abuse and which wrought havoc on Saivism is what is known as Vamachara or Virachara ritual of Shakti which requires Panchatatva for its due performance. They are vulgarly styled Pancha makāra. It is presumed that the Sadhaka must have been duly initiated before he could be considered fit for the Sadhana (practice). The necessaries that make it up are called Madhya, Māmsa, Matsya, Mudra and Maithuna (Wine, meat, fish, grain
40
and woman)
SAKTI PUJA OR VAMACHARA
It is also called Rahasya Puja (Lata Sadhana) It is best not to say more about this In support of this, the Tantrik pandits quote Manu as the authority, and seem to rely also on the Kalıkōpanishad of the Atharva Veda
66
&lsquo;Na Māmsabhakshana dosho na madvee, na cha maithune
Pravrittiresha bhutanam nivrittistu mahāphala&rdquo;
(Manu)
(There is no wrong in the eating of meat nor in the drinking of wine, nor in sexual intercourse, for these things are natural to men At the same time, abstention therefrom is productive of great good&rdquo;)
Further, animal sacrifice was considered unobjectionable, since in the Asvamedha Yajna by Yudhishtira a horse was killed, offered to the Devas and eaten In the great Yajna which lasted a hundred years, Shaunaka and other Rishis used to listen to the Srimad Bhagavata from the mouth of Suta and at the same time sacrificed animals.
There was (it is not known if they still exist) a sect called Mahavritas who took a rigid vow to eat only from a human skull as bowl, wear round their neck a garland of human bones and perform their penance in cremation and burial grounds seated on human corpses The Jangams formed another class whose meateating, drinking and other vices were revolting to public morals All these formed component parts of Saivism. Black-art and necromancy form a part of the cult, although they are condemned as underworld tantras. The presiding devatas are from the Saivite pantheon. The Agamas relating to these have however been classed as Asat Agamas.
It is modern Vaishnavism that is considered to have made a departure by copying the Buddhist principle in prohibiting animal sacrifice Even in Yagas and Yajnas it is only a pasu (cow) made of rice or other grain flour that is used for sacrifice
The Alvärs were not content with these departures They preached and practised more revolutionary doctrines taking care
41
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
not to shock the ideas of Varnäsrama Dharma prevalent in those days. So far as spirituality was concerned, there was no distinction based on caste, non-caste or sex. They copied Buddhism and made women eligible to become ächāryas. When we look at the composition of the recognised Ālvārs, we may classify them as follows:
The first three Alvars-Poygai Alvar, Bhutattalvar and Payalvar:They never let anybody know what caste or parentage was theirs, nor did any one know. All of them hail from Kanchi Mandalam Kanchi, Tirukkaḍalmalai (Mahabalipuram), and Mailai, (Mylapore). Their birth date is ascribed by Dr.Swamikannu Pillai to about 719 A.D. But it is immaterial for our present purpose, to know the exact date.
(4) Tirumalisai Alvar:-He himself said that he was not born in any of the known castes. He was a fondling brought up by a Vedan (huntsman). He became greatly learned in the Sāstrās and even the Vedas, Jainism, Buddhism and the Saivite Pasupata Agamās. He preferred Vaishnavism of his own choice. His birth date is supposed to be 720 A.D. (Dr. Swamikannu).
The above four represent Kanchi Manḍalam, and not one of them was a caste man, as far as was known.
(5) Nammalvar:-Was the son of a highly cultured Sūdra couple, Kāri and Aḍaya Nangai. From the moment of birth, he was considered a remarkable spiritual being. He was born in Tirukkurukai (Tirunelveli District) about 798 A. D. He is acknowledged to be the greatest of the Alvārs.
(6) Madhurakavi Alvar:-Of very orthodox Brahmin parentage of the village of Tirukkōilür, a Sama Vēdi, who after sojourn throughout India found in Nammāļvār his great Āchārya. It is to him that Sri Nammalvar is said to have vouchsafed Tiruviruttam (Rigvedasāram), Tiruvasiriyam (Yajurveda), Periyatiruvandādi (Atharva Veda) and Tiruvoimoli in particular which is the sheet anchor of the modern Sri Vaishnava Siddhantam and practice. He is said to have been born in 797 A.D.
42
MODERN VAISHNAVISM AND THE ALVARS
(7) Periyalvar:-Born in Srivilliputtur of orthodox Vaishnava family. He is also known as Vishnu Chittan, and Paṭṭarpirän and sang the celebrated &ldquo;Pallanḍu Pallanḍu&rdquo;. Born 725 A.D.
(8) Andal:-The foster daughter of Periyalvar picked up as a fondling in the flower garden of Periyalvar about 776 A. D. in Srivilliputtur. She remained a virgin and is reputed to have become the consort of Sri Ranganatha. A woman Saint.
(9) Kulasekhara Alvar:-Also known as Kollikkavalan, a Kshatriya, born in Kollinagar (or Tiruvanjikkulam) as the son of Dridhavritaraja, a great Sanskrit poet and scholar. Became a devout Sri Vaishnava and Saint. 767 A.D. (Kerala). His name is given to the gold-plated door step in the Tirumala Sanctum (Kulasekharappadi).
(10) Tondaradippodi Alvar:-Born of orthodox Brahmin, Sri Vaishnava parentage in Tirumandarakkuḍi. Also known as Vipranarayanan. He served in Srirangam temple maintaining Nandavanam (787-88 A.D.).

While Nammāļvār, Periāļvār, Anḍāl, Kulasekharan and Madhurakavi may be said to belong to the extreme South composed of the Pandya and Kerala countries, Tondaraḍippodi, Tiruppānan and Tirumangai Ālvārs represent the Chola country. We have seen that Poygai, Bhūtam, Pēriyaļvār and Tirumalisai represent the Kanchi or Tonḍai mandalam. If we bear this distribution in mind, we will see that in the Tonḍai mandalam, the impact with Jainism and Buddhism was a little earlier than in Pandyanäḍu. On the
43
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
whole almost all the Alvars may be said to be contemporaries, the concentration of the largest numbers being in the tracts where the heretic religions had to be contended with. The new faith preached by all these Aivars was in essence the same, based on Bhakti and Love. The team represents almost all castes of society and both the sexes. The leader of this pantheon has been universally recognised by all Srivaishnavas to be Nammāļvār, a Sat Sūdra by birth. The most learned of the Brahmins was his devoted Sishya, Madhura Kavi. Madhura Kavi is considered by some to be the same as Māran Kāri, who excavated the cave temple and installed Narasimhaswami in the Anamalai Hills, 770 A.D. during the reign of the Pandya King Varaguna Maharaja. If so there must be some thing wrong with the birth date.
Periya Alvar of Pandya Naḍu was also a Brahmin; Kulasekhara, a Kshatriya, who preferred a devotee&rsquo;s robe to that of a monarch. Andal, the foster daughter of a Brahmin, preferred to remain unmarried and became a devotee.
All the four Alvārs of Kanchi Mandalam were of unknown parentage. And Tirumalisai distinctly states that he did not come of any of the four castes.
Tirumangai and Tondaraḍippodi of the Chola country had not a clean record of life before they became great devotees and Saints.
It will thus be seen that the new faith held out equal opportunities for all to become saintly and that the sins of the past in this life cannot stand in the way of reformation to the extent of a clean wiping out of all past record. It copied the Buddhists in this respect and also in respect of placing women on a footing of equality with men in the spiritual field. It was the acquisition of the power of intense love that made it possible for Tirumangai Alvar to switch over in one instant from the materia! to the spiritual plane.
But was this pantheon of the Alvars recognised in their life time? And how does it in any way affect the practices of the Tiruvengaḍam temple?
44
ALVARS&rsquo; LIFE AND WORK. BHAKTI AND LOVE
The pantheon certainly did not come into existence till after the days of Sriman Nätha Munigal and even long after Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s days. The tradition is that the Alvārs&rsquo; hymns were sung in odd bits in different temples scattered all over the Tamil country and that Nathamuni during his tours of pilgrimage observed that they contained great spiritual truths in the finest Tamil. He set about compiling them together. Tradition says that he was able to do this successfully on account of his yogic powers. This is a tradition universally accepted by all Sri Vaishnavas. There is in fact no evidence of the Alvārs&rsquo; spiritual leadership having gained country-wide acceptance during their lifetime. A few of them seem to have attended the assemblies of disputation convened by the Pandyan and the Chola Kings from time to time and proved the superiority of their Vaishnavite tenets. Tradition also says that when Tirumalisai Alvar entered an assemblage of Brahmins reciting the Vedas on a great occasion, they stopped the recitation as he was not a Dvija. When they forgot where they had left off, it was Tirumalisai that pointed out to them by signs as to where to commence, since in his humility he would not utter the words himself.
46
Nor is there evidence that during Nathamuni&rsquo;s days, a pantheon of Alvārs was created. But his grandson, Sri Alavandar showed the way. In commencing his work Stotraratnam,&quot; he first offers in three stanzas his pranamams to his grand father and Guru Sriman Nathamuni and then in one stanza to Parasara, because he gave to the world true knowledge in his Vishnu Purāna (Puranaratnam) and then in another stanza to the feet of Nammāļvār—whom he calls the progenitor of his Kula (Vaishnavism)—* Naha adyasya kulapateh&rsquo;-and who is the mother, father, wife, sons, wealth and all else to him and his fellow Vaishnavas. We may therefore take it as a settled fact that it was Yamuna Muni (Āļavandar) that made the Sri Vaishnava faith what it has since become under the spiritual influence of Nammāļvār. But later on Sri Ramanuja, while commencing the writing of his Sri Bhashya on the Brahma Sutras, first prays to God Srinivasa (Brahmani Srinivase) for giving him true knowledge and Bhakti. Then his prostrations go to Vyasa. In this connection, the Acharya-parampara is not
45HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
through Alavandar, Nathamuni and Nammālvär. Apart from this unique deviation, every Sri Vaishnava knows that, according to established custom, his first business after putting on his Namams is to pay obeisance to his immediate Acharya and through him in ascending order right up to Nathamuni and Nammālvār. After Nammālvär his next saviours are Divine, viz., Vishvaksena, Sri and Sridhara. So far as human Acharyas are concerned, Nammālvār is the final one, because he is believed to have received his intuitive knowledge direct from God, through Sri and Vishvaksena.
Temples which were in existence from or before the days of Nammālvär may not have been modelled on the theological concepts of Nammāļvār at the time of their consecration. But all temples consecrated by Sri Vaishnavas after the days of Nammāļvārrather since Alavandar&rsquo;s days-must be presumed to be in accor dance with Nammalvar&rsquo;s conception of Vishnu worship. The consecration of the silver image of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan was during the lifetime of Alavandar.
We have now to see why this new image was consecrated. There was already the Svayambhu (self-manifest) Murti which needed no consecration by human hands. But whatever kind of Puja was there, before consecration of the silver image, it was not according to Nammal war&rsquo;s conception. We have noticed that Kanchi was the nerve centre of all the then known religions of the South. The Saivite saint Appar called it &ldquo;Kalviye karai ilāda Kānchimā nagar&rdquo; (the great city of Kanchi where culture knew no bounds). There as well as in the Pandyan country, Jainism and Buddhism were active and alive. Saivism was running riot in all directions good and bad. The old Vishnu temples had their own well-worn Agamic ruts in which they were running. The political conditions in the Tamil country during the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries were anything but settled, owing to the incessant wars between the Pallavas, Cholas and Pandyas with the Rashtrakūtas and the Chalukyas interfering in these wars. Kanchi itself was more than once in the hands of Rashtrakutas and therefore under Jain influence. Of the Pallavas, some were Saivites and some Vaishnavites, with no marked theological or philosophical distinctions. As soon as the Cholas conquered Tondai Mandalam
46
TIRUMALA SELECTED FOR SRI VAISHNAVISM
at the beginning of the 10th century. Saivite influence became more prominent.
It was therefore necessary for Sri Vaishnava leaders to seek some place where there was no old sectarian controversy and where old feuds might not breed new causes of disturbance.
Where was the place besides Tirumala with a greater claim to sanctity and where there was no settled form of worship as yet established? Early at the commencement of the ninth century, the Vaishnavas (they were not styled Sri Vaishnavas then but Emperumānaḍiyār) consecrated a small temple called Tiruvilankōil of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan in Tiruchukanür. With the advent of the Cholas as rulers of the land, a Siva temple of Parasarisvara began to find favour there. The consecration of the Maṇavālapperumal (silver image) in Tirumala itself about the year 966 A.D., thus became a necessity. The popularity which the temple gained in later years was entirely due to putting into practice the high ideals of Sri Nammāļvār.
WHAT WERE THE IDEALS OF NAMMALWAR?
We have seen that controversies were going on between the protagonists of the different religions and sects. We also know what Tiruamlisai Alvar had to say in the matter:
&quot;&quot;
அறியார் சமண ரயர்த்தார் பவுத்தர்
சிறியார் சிவப்பட்டர் செப்பில் - வெறியாய மாயவனை மாலவனை மாதவனை யேத்தாதார்
ஈனவரே யாதலா லின்று.
(நான்முக. திரு .6;)
சாத்திரம் கற்றோம் சமண்கற்றோம் சங்கரனார் ஆக்கிய வாகமநூ லாராய்தோம்-பாக்கியத்தால் செங்கட் கரியானைச் சேர்ந்தோம்யாம் தீதிலமே எங்கட் கரியதொன்றில்&rsquo;
47
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
These two stanzas go to show that the Alvar after careful study of the Saiva Agamas, of Budhism and Jainism, considered that by good luck, he came to place his faith in Vishnu worship.
There were however the first three Alvārs, who, though they were as staunch as Tirumalisai in their faith in Vishnu worship described the form of Tiruvēngaḍamuḍaiyān as one in whom both Vishnu and Siva existed in happy combination. They also left no doubt that He was Vishnu Murti. Periya Alvar gives the description of the Murti in the following stanza:
(1) He has in his form the flowing matted locks (jadai), the high peaked crown (நீண் முடி), the shining dagger (ஒண்மழுவு) and the chakram, the snake coiling him and the golden sutram round his waist. In Him, my father on Tirumala, the two forms have gracefully blended into one.1
(2) The golden-hued Holy one (Siva) and the one who rose to the skies to encompass this earth, Trivikrama (உலகம்தாய நெடுமால்) Vishnu, the two may pass as separate ones, but the one is really in the other.2
These two Āļvārs believed in the identity of the two:-
(A) But Nammāļvār gives a more lucid exposition:
&lsquo;ஏறனைப் பூவனைப்பூ மகள் தன்னை
வேறின்றி விண்தொழத்தன் னுள்வைத்து
(1)&lsquo;தாழ்சடையும் நீண்முடியு மொண்மழுவுஞ் சக்கரமும் சூழரவும் பொன்னாணுந் தோன்றுமால் - சூழும் திரண்டருவி பாயுந் திருமலைமே லெந்தைக்கு
ரண்டுருவு மொன்றா யிசைந்து.&rsquo;&rsquo;
(2) பொன் திகழுமேனிப் புரிசடையம் புண்ணியனும்
நின்றுலகந் தாய நெடுமாலும் - என்றும்
இருவரங்கத் தாற்றிரிவ ரேலும்-ஒருவன் ஒருவனங்கத் தென்று முளன்.&rsquo;&rsquo;

TEMPLE ITS POPULARITY
&ldquo;He has merged in Himself (in the undifferentiated state) Rudra, Brahma and Lakshmi after losing their separate entity (Gausir p); He pierced by his growth the highest heavens to encompass creation. Is there a Higher Divinity than that Mäl (Vishnu)?!&rdquo;
The idea that Rudra, Brahma and Lakshmi are separate Deities having independant status is negatived by Nammalvar. Tirumalisai and several of the other Alvårs share this view. In fact the view is that Vishnu created Brahma who in turn created Siva. It is in this sense that Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan has been presented to us. He is not any of the ten Avatars of Vishnu. He is Nārāyana Himself who for the benefit of mankind in this Kali age has made Himself self-manifest in Vengadam for reasons known to him only.
This conception cannot possibly be engrafted on the older Āgamic Vishnu temples. This conception accounts for the absence of any shrine even for Lakshmi in Tirumala. The Murti is common to all sects, although the worship is to the Form of Vishnu.
(B) To make this clearer, in another place the same Alvār
says:-
&ldquo;Worship and praise each His own Deity (Ishta Devata), they all reach my Tirumal (Vishnu).&rdquo;
2
(C) Men have their own desires in this world and have therefore been propitiating different Deities who are supposed to have the power to bestow different kinds of boons. These were being done according to the Tantras laid down in the Agamas. Some are good and some are bad. We know that non-Vaishnavas have far too many Vritas. There is no need for these tiresome

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
pujas. The Alvar says that Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan is the giver of all gifts whatever be one&rsquo;s desires.
(D) But he also says that if he is worshipped for the love of it, He bestows on the worshipper the good things of this world; then, as the result of one&rsquo;s good actions, life in the other worlds if so desired; and finally and by degrees or stages Moksham. All the Vritas which require intermediaries in the shape of human help and those of the lesser gods may be dispensed with. Sri Vaishnavas have therefore dispensed with all Kamya Vrita Karmas. Only such as are enjoined by the Sastras as obligatory need be and must be performed. Even for these the Sankalpam is that one has no claim to the fruits of the performance of such acts. (Sātvika tyāgam).
(E) The highest value which the Alvar attaches to Bhakti and Bhaktas is expressed in the following stanza:
&lsquo;குலந்தாங்கு சாதிகள் நாலிலுங் கீழிழிந்து எத்தனை நலந்தா னிலாத சண் டாளசண டாளர்க ளாகிலும் வலந்தாங்கு சக்கரத் தண்ணல் மணிவண்ணற் காளென்றுள கலந்தார் அடியார் தம்மடி யாரெம் மடிகளே.&rsquo;

He says that he is the devout servant of those who are Vishnu Bhaktas, even if such happens to be born as lower than the lowest of Chandalas. The superiority of Bhakti over the path pursued by the performance of Vedic rituals (including Yagas, Yajnas etc.,) is being annually proclaimed in the solem performance of a festival known as the reading of the Kaisika Puranam early in the morning of the Uttana Dvādasi day before day break. The Puranam inculcates the superiority of Bhakti. A very learned Brahmin pursuing the path to salvation according to Vedic injunctions was, owing to a flaw in the performance of such Karma, destined to become a Brahma Rakshas. It was vouchsafed that a great Bhakta would turn up several years later at whose hands the curse would cease to operate and the Brahmin would achieve salvation. A

Chandala, by name Nampaduvan, was incessant and uning in785. his Bhakti and observed Ekadasi Upavasam for twelve years the twelfth year, this Brahmarakshas waylaid the Chanda and wanted to eat his flesh The Chandala agreed to be the pey, but wanted a short respite so that he might go to the temple and sing the usual praises of God. The Brahmarakshas could not believe that the man would come back; but after many assurances were given, agreed to wait. True to his word and against the advice of a Brahmin, the Chandala kept the engagement. Then it seems to have dawned on the Brahmarakshas that the moment of salvation had come for him. He offered to let go the Chandala if he would only transfer to him the virtue acquired by his devotion. The Chandala said that he had no power to do that. He was performing only Nishkama Karma. He had already passed to God himself the fruits of his action. In a series of cajoling words, the Brahmarakshas asked him to part with the virtue acquired by the last song he sang in the Kaisika rāga, but in vain. Then he prostrated before the Chandala and requested him to obtain salvation for him. The story of his life was then revealed. The Chandala out of real humility pleaded that he was of the lowest of human beings, but if he could really intercede to help another soul, he would willingly pray to God. The Brahmarakshasa&rsquo;s curse came to an end and the Brahmin got his salvation. This furanam is being read year after year by some member or other of family of Sri Alavandar in all the Vaishnavite temples in the Tamil country. The reading of the Puranan is only to remind all Sri Vaishnavas what was Nammalvar&rsquo;s attitude to Bhaktas wherever they may be born.
(F) Spiritual advancement is equally open to all. The composition of the Pantheon of Alvars bears testimony to this. In the daily routine of a Vaishnavite temple, it is to be clearly seen. There are no separate compartments for different castes for worship in the sanctum as is the case in many Saivite temples. All mix freely and even indiscriminately. The Tirtham vessel does not get polluted after a spoonful thereof is given to a Harijan nor is the Sathari considered polluted by being placed on the head of a Harijan. There is one more proof in Tirumala. A portion
51
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of the cooked food, which is the first food offering after Tirumanjanam, and the only one that is allowed inside the Kulasekharappadi, is kept in the sanctum. A little of it is given to the worshipper after Tirtham and Sathari. In ordinary Brahmin houses, if a portion of the food is given to a Sudra, the remaining portion is considered polluted and unfit to be eaten by a Brahmin. In the Tirumala temple, a small lump of prasadam will be accepted with veneration by a Brahmin whose turn comes next to that of a Harijan. There is no touch-pollution inside a temple, or even in God&rsquo;s procession in the streets. He who entertains the feeling of pollution will be born a dog or an ass. In Srirangam one of the tirtham mirasdars is a Sättāda Srivaishnava. In the Tirumala temple, these Sättāda Srivaishnavas enjoyed the privilege of supplying all the articles required for Tirumanjanam, carried in procession round the temple before being delivered inside. They were receiving honours and emoluments in return. They also enjoyed the privilege of reciting prabandhams in gōshţi along with the Brahmin Srivaishnavas and were given emoluments. For some reason or other, they ceased to perform the sacred duty. Inscriptions bear testimony to the practice.
This rather long exposition is given to show why and how the temple of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan became popular with all the sects of Hindus. We may go to the Telugu and Kanarese countries or Kerala and Maharashtra, the prefix Venkata will be found tacked on to any kind of name. It may be Venkata Raman, Venkata Subrahmanian, Venkata Subban, Venkata Sivadu, Venkata Narasa, Venkata Krishna etc. The reason is that Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan is considered the family Deity in many families in South India. This acceptance as family Deity is due to the Alvārs&rsquo; conception of the form of that Deity.
There is one question which any non-Vaishnava acquainted with the routine of daily worship in this temple may raise. How is it that the Sri Vaishnavas have for themselves exclusively one item of worship called the Sattumurai to which the others are not given admission? The answer to this consists of two parts. One is that Sättumurai is not an item of worship in the view of the Vaikhanasa Archaka nor according to Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s work
52
TEMPLE, ITS POPULARITY
&ldquo;Nityam.&rdquo; It is a function coming at the tailend after the orthodox ritualistic worship according to the Agama is completed and after the non-Agamic Sahasranāmārchana. It is only an innovation made some time after the Muslims or the East India Company assumed management of the temple. Barring the strict rituals of worship in Sanskrit riks several of the other items and festivals are of a compromise character, a compromise between Ramanuja&rsquo;s Pancharatram and Vaikhanasam. The Sattumurai is one of such items. The second part of the reply is that the exclusion of devotees of other persuasion is not an ancient custom. It was introduced when the T.T.D. Committee first came to power. The overcrowding in the temple was so much that bonafide Sri Vaishnavas, who could recite the prabandhams and take active part in the function, could not gain admission due to their chronic poverty and lack of influence. On the other hand, spectators took up all available space coming as they did with letters of recommendation. To make the function successful admission was restricted to those who could recite the prabandham so far as the portions relating to Sattumurai were concerned. The function itself is a latter-day innovation and does not find place in any of the inscriptions as an item of daily worship. It was recited outside the Temple first and then outside the Sannidhi and in front of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine, on certain occasions only. The word Sattumurai is only a Tamil word and has no equivalent in Sanskrit.
There is an assurance given by Nammāļvār in regard to Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyān which cannot well be left cryptic. He advises mén possessing high intellectual gifts (particularly poets) not to prostitute the rare gift they possess for the gratification of unworthy mortals for the sake of a small remuneration. He advises them to earn their bread by doing hard manual work and to make use of their gifts to worship and praise God, each his own Ishta Devata. But if really boons have to be asked, he assures them that this Deity will grant whatever is prayed for. The words used are &ldquo;Vendirrellam tarum kōdil maṇivanṇan&rdquo; and they are words deliberate in expression. So we see people making pilgrimage to Tirupati to fulfil their vows. The man who was blessed with a son, another who got cured of a serious illness in a miraculous
53
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
manner, the man who escaped a serious accident, the burglar who escaped punishment, the one who wanted that he should have no scorpion sting, nay-even the murderer who went unpunished, all go and fulfil their vows.
The Alvar would not have overlooked the accepted mythology that Bhasmasura, Hiranya, Maha Bali, Rāvana, Kamsa and several other Rakshasas were given the boons they asked for, all of which were used against society and God. The one who granted those boons could not have been ignorant of the fact that they were going to be used against Himself. Evolution of the soul through the exercise of Free will accounts for this paradox or Theodicy.
In the Alvar&rsquo;s conception, the final goal of the individual soul is Moksham (Vidu). There will be ups and downs in the ascent to this goal. Errors are bound to bring about repentance and must lead to success. The Alvar does not hold out to even the worst sinner the horrors of eternal damnation and hell. So he says that God grants anything one asks for. By sheer experience, he learns to ask for things which are for his eternal good. In the spiritual ascent even failures count. The Alvar&rsquo;s advice is that one must learn to love, heart and soul, even if that love is for a material object. The capacity for intense love once acquired can in a moment and at the mere touch of a great master be switched over to the right object. When that is done it becomes Bhakti. So we find in his songs that he represents himself as a woman pining to gain Him who is the object of her love. We have a concrete instance in the person of Tirumangai Ālvār.
In the absence of Love (or Bhakti) as the dominant factor the acquisition of psychic powers, through boons granted or as the result of severe penance, may lead to disastrous consequences. Leaving aside the Rakshasas, the powers acquired by Viswamitra resulted only in making him land from one morass into another, until he found out that Vasishta was the model to follow. There was no soul more perfected than that of Maha Bali in his days. But he knew not how to conquer the self and boasted that he was in the supreme position of the Giver. God had to teach him
54
TEMPLE, ITS POPULARITY
that nothing was his, that his self was itself God&rsquo;s own and had to be surrendered to Him. While commenting upon this phenomenon, Nammāļvār beseeches God to play the same trick with him. He wonders how he can repay God for this great act which was done to him. He says that he gave away his self, his ego to God&rsquo;s keeping. As an after-thought he corrects himself and puts the question to himself. What is my soul and who am I to dispose of it? It is all His; He gave and He takes it away at His pleasure.
The history of this temple in its earlier days was shaped by great men who were imbued with the Alvārs&rsquo; high and practical philosophy. Its fame rose by leaps and bounds. Today, this temple stands pre-eminently the greatest in the land.
&ldquo;Venkatesa samō Dēvo nabhūtō na bhavishyatı&rdquo; is repeated day after day during Mantrapushpam. The closing mangalam is:
&ldquo;Sri nagaryām mahā puryām Tāmpraparnyuttarētatē,
tintri në mula dhamnē Sri Sathagopāya mangalam&rdquo;
to remind us of Saint Nammāļvār.
55CHAPTER IV.
History of the Tiruvengadam Temples (in Tirumala, Tirupati etc.)
SYNOPSIS.
OUR ancients thought that it was possible to realise the infinite
through the finite, to comprehend the power and glory of the formless and all-pervasive Divinity through the worship of an image with form which is usually consecrated and installed in a temple. Just as we today try to concentrate the rays of the sun by scientific processes and to utilize the mighty forces of solar energy for serving our material welfare, the ancient Hindus tried to focus the infinite powers and attributes of the invisible Divinity in a visible image for ministering to our spiritual welfare. The Mahabharata (Mausala Parvam, Chapter V) account of the origin of image worship was already referred to in Chapter II. This is how image worship came into being and the object of this book is to explain how it came in Tirumala and Tirupati, in what manner and with what results. It is really not known when the Birthless One came to have a birth on the Vengadam Hills of His own Choice (Svayam Vyaktam). The large image-form seems to have been there from an unknown date. All that we can say is when the small stone temple was built to enshrine the image. In fact the history of the Tiruvengadam Temple is seen to commence not on the Hills, but in the small village of Tiruchokinur (Tiruchchokunur or Tiruchchukanur) now going by the name of Tiruchanur or Chiratanur about ten miles south of the Hills by road. Changes in the political conditions of the country seem to have largely influenced the building of a temple on the Vengadam Hill itself and in the founding of a new village near the foot of the Hill by Sri Ramanuja known as Tirupati. The Pallava rule during which the temple was built was overthrown by the Cholas and Saivism gained the upper hand for some time. For a correct understanding of the inscriptions which reveal this history, it is necessary that we should understand the religious atmosphere of the corresponding
56
SYNOPSIS
period and the political conditions favourable or unfavourable at the time.
But before entering into details, it may as well be useful to state in brief the scope of the T. T. inscriptions. A temple in Thiruchchukanur ten miles away from the main focal point on Vengadam proved unsatisfactory as it may give rise to a conflict with the Siva Temple and dissipate energy. A small silver image, a replica of the main God (Dhruva Murti or Periya Perumal), was therefore made, bedecked with a number of jewels and formally consecrated according to prescribed rituals in the year 966 A.D. by a lady devotee, named Samavai. This small idol made it possible for the Bhaktas to satisfy their cravings to worship the Deity with all the ecstasy which the Alvars described in the outpourings of their heart. A century later Sri Ramanuja came on the scene and carried out many developments. The Yadavarayas who were the local rulers, were largely responsible for placing the finances of the temple on a satisfactory basis. The form of worship from this period, right down to about 1300 A.D., was in closer accordance with the tenets of Vaikhānasa Āgama which governed the consecration of the temple. In the earliest days the worship does not appear to have been in the strict Vaikhanasa form. The very Agama warned the Vaikhānasas not to interfere with old usages etc., in Svayamvyakta temples. The images of the Alvars and that of Sri Andal had no place in the sanctum, nor had they separate shrines inside or outside the Tirumala temple. The image of Sri Ramanuja was the sole exception. Even he had no separate worship for him in the temple. This has been the state of affairs even to this day. Even in Tirupati the shrines for Tirumangai Āļvār, Nammāļvār and Andal seem to have come into existence in the latter half of the 13th century A.D. The quantity of food offerings was limited to the extent of the requirements of the temple servants. There was little left for Desäntries, or pilgrims. The quantity was ridiculously below the standard fixed in the Agama for the lowest class of temples (Adhamādhama).
There were no festivals of importance excepting the Brahmotsavams, the two Vishu Sankramanas, the two Ayana Sankramanas, the Mukkōți Dvadasi and much later the Utthana (Kaisika) Dvādasi.
57
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Muslim invasions of the South India by Malik Kafur In 1310 A.D. and by Mohammed Bin Tughlak brought about some changes. Singayya Dannayaka, the military commander and minister of the Hoysala King Vira Ballala, made some innovations. He was a staunch Sri Vaishnava of the Mysore country, whose ancestors must have been under the religious spell of Sri Ramanuja who spent the period of his exile in that part of South India. Nandavanams (flower gardens) and Mutts were established by him. He came over to Tirupati to guard the political interests of the Yadavaraya ruler as the Pandiyan power had broken down. He made the Yadavaraya in 1328 A.D. assign a village in his favour for rendering certain food services to the God. And the Yadavaraya followed suit in the name of his forebear Yadava Narayana. Just about the same time (1339 A.D.) images of the Utsava Murti along with the two Nachchimar came to view in the inscriptions. Certain new festivals were now instituted where food offerings on a larger scale than before were made and distributed to the congregation. There seems to have been no room for these images in the old Vaikhānasa form of worship in Tirumala. Even in Tirupati such festivals were unknown before. This Murti is the Malayappan of our day, known at the time as Malai Kuniya Ninra Perumal. This innovation was in keeping with the type of festival celebrations in the Tamil Chola and Pandyan countries.
We are in a position to trace the development of the Sandhi offerings and the Asthanams&rsquo; as the direct or indirect effect of Malik Kafur&rsquo;s invasion of the South which drove some of the Southern Srivaishnavas to Tirumala and Tirupati. We will find the singing of Tiruppavai first in the later half of the 13th century A.D. in Tirupati and of Tiruvaimoli in the third quarter of the 14th century in Tirumala. The beginnings of the Arisanalayam Nandavanam and Matham which later developed into the Jiyar Matham and also of the Van Sathagopan Nandavanam which gave rise to the Ahobila matham will be noticed.

of the temple in 1250 A.D., including the gopurams, the renovation of the sanctum on a grand scale and the construction and hasty closure of the Mukkōți Pradakshinam and the first gold guilding of the vimanams will also be discussed.
We will also go into the details of the administrative machinery of the temple from the days of the Srikaryakartas and the Sabhaiyars of Tiruchchukanur to the Sthanattar(1209)acting under the authority of the early Yadavarayas, the constitution in 1390 A.D. of an ad-hoc independent body composed of four representatives of the townsmen of Tirupati, three representatives of the Sabhaiyar, one representative of the Archakas, the two Jiyars and two representatives of the newly created temple accountan&rsquo;s (Tiru-ninra-ūrUdaiyar) all subject to the overriding control of the King himself; the gradual deterioration in the morale of this committee, the growth in the volume of food offerings which was exploited to the full by the Sthanattar and the attempts made by Saluva Narasimha and the Vijayanagar Kings to curb this evil and make more food available to the pilgrims by the establishment of Rāmānuja Kūtams and Satrams. The evil, however, invaded even these institutions and food could be had for the pilgrims only on payment. The Sthanattar and the Archakas and Jiyars seem to have sold their share to lessees who sold the prasadams. When the endowments for food offerings increased, the Sthanattar seemed to have prevailed upon the donors to endow for Vagaipadi (baked or fried in ghee) in increasing quantities so that their share might be sold at convenience. The result of all this was the establishment of a free feeding house in Tirupati by one Aravidu Kondaraja in 1547 in the Nammāļvāär sannidhi which he built and about 2000 Sri Vaishnavas irrespective of caste were fed there daily in a sumptuous manner. This will be dealt with at length in its proper place. The difficulty felt by the Sthanattar in the disposal of large quantities of prasadams by sale was also sought to be overcome by the institution of festivals wherein payment was made in cash for all the servants of the temple from the Sthanattar down to the sweeper. These went under the sub-heads of expenditure called Tirumuna Kanikkai(திருமுன காணிக்கை)and Tirukkai Valakkam திருக்கை aps). These payments were, however, justifiable as the servants were asked to work overtime.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Arrangements for the daily recitation of the Vedas in the temple (in addition to the Tiruvoimoli) were sought to be made by Sri Devaraya Mahārāya II (in 1430 A.D.) and this was long after Tiruvoimoli gained ground and Adhyayanotsavams celebrated. Devaraya had to make solemn promises on the shore of the Swami Pushkarini to the Mahajans that yearly payment would be made for their services. How the Emperumanadiyars or Tiruvidhisanis (dancing girls) came into existence, how their influence grew till one of their number was accorded higher honours than that of any acharya or the king and how they suddenly disappeared from the temple inscriptions will also be explained.
The growth in the type of food offerings from the simple cooked rice, green-gram, ghee and curds, of the early days to the much more gluttonous types such as Paruppaviyal Tiruppōnakam, Tirukkanamadai, Dadhyōdanam, the six kinds of Ogarais, the Sarkarai pongal, Atirasams, Appams, Vadais, Iḍdilis, Sukhiyan, Godhi, Käsikkay, Bhetnikai, Pal Kulambu, and several more, all these recorded in the inscriptions disclose how the authorities catered more to the palate than to the spirit of the pilgrim. The growth in the number of subsidiary temples in Tirupati diverted the emoluments from the Sthanattar to other more needy stomachs. What is of greater interest to the student of the ancient politica and economic history of the country is also clearly seen in the inscriptions. The working of the ancient village assemblies, the agency which enquired into their faults of commission and omission and the method adopted for quick redress of grievances are portrayed in the inscriptions. The taxes levied by the king and those which the village assembly levied are given in some detail. We have also an instance of how a number of the Naṭṭārs of village assemblies met to decide on common action when the suggestion emanated from the king.
The rise in the cost of living from time to time is reflected in the increased amount of money which had to be paid by the donor for the same kind of food offerings. The actual prices of commodities in bulk and in retail are recorded from the middle of the 16th century A.D. These and several connected matters have been faithfully recorded here with the aid of inscriptions.

SAKA YEAR CITATORY
Although the usual method of making endowments for services to be performed in the temple was either in the shape of money or by the grant of villages, occasions are noticed in the inscriptions when either because money went underground owing to political turmoils, or because the capacity of the Sthanattar foi judicious expenditure on the improvement, repairs and creation of fresh irrigation sources was doubted, the donors executed the works themselves by paying labour in cash or in kind Such changes when read along with the change in chronology for the recording of inscriptions disclose to a certainly unsettled political condition Where whole villages were granted it was not usual in the earlier periods to state what the amount of annual income would be Only the services to be maintained from the income were shown But in later periods, particularly after Krishnadeva Maharava reign, it became the practice to state the normal income either because prices fluctuated too much or because the Sthanattar&rsquo;s capacity was doubted After the battle of Talikota, it is not even the income, but the yield in grain that was being noted We also find that the prices of commodities were fluctuating in an uncertain The chronology cited in the inscriptions mentioned the year of the reigning monarch till we reach the period when the Pandyan suzerainty broke down and the Vijayanagar reign had not been well established Even in the earliest period when the Pallava rule came to an end and the Chola rule had not been well established, the chronology adopted in the inscription was the Sāli Saka Again when the Pandyans collapsed and Malik Kafur was rushing down the Saka year is referred to, and no mention made of any ruling king Although the Vijayanagar sovereignty was established due to the strong backing given by Saluva Narasimha his policy was to avoid dynastic chronology and stick to the Saka year only This was systematically adopted since then although the name of the ruler was coupled with the mention of the Saka year from the time of Achyutaraya When there were succession troubles, the name of the king was not mentioned, or if the donor desired such mention to express his loyalty to one party or the other, the policy of the Sthanattar was simply to record the donor&rsquo;s attitude. These will go to show the status of the Sthanattar vis-a-vis the ruler of the land.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
There is yet another point which will be noticed in detail in due course. The Vijayanagar Kings were less sectarian in their attitude to the temple administration than their predecessors, whatever the personal conviction of the particular emperor might have been. This was more marked in the case of Krishna Deva Maharaya. His gifts were incomparably large and costly, al Imade in a spirit of personal attachment. He does not seem to have ever enquired what was done with the huge amounts of money paid by him. He did not show any preference for any Sri Vaishnava connected or unconnected with the temple. Achyutadēva Maharaya was more demonstrative and egotistic as a Sri Vaishnava. Even he does not appear to have interfered in the administration of the temple. Sadasivadeva Maharaya seems to have been all humility. His visits could not have been more than two. He made no large endowments personally; he did however encourage those who gave their all to the service of the temple and set his heart on making arrangements which tended to give greater creature comforts to the ever-increasing number of pilgrims. Benefactions on a large scale were by far greater during his reign, mostly by private agencies.
Speaking of private agencies and endowments, we should do Justice to the residents of Tirupati and Chandragiri of those days and describe the part played by them. The Archakas, Tirumala Nambi and Anandāļvār, laboured on the Hill a thousand years ago. Then came the Jivars and other Acharyapurushas, who served the temple since then. It has to be noted from the inscriptions that they did not lead a parasitic life on the temple. When no crown seemed to sit surely and safely on the head of the wearer, the citizens of Tirupati, the Sabhaiyars of the surrounding villages and the permanent religious office-bearers of the temple shouldered the responsibility for the management of the temple. They were given the highest respect by local rulers and military commanders, made their own contributions as endowments from out of their small savings, influenced their spiritual disciples to do likewise, went about the country doing propaganda in the name of Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan, made the temple famous and themselves prosperous. The extent of their endowments was not insignificant

and will be dealt with in detail later. Such names as Kollikkavali dasar Mallanagal or Madhvadasar of Chandragiri, Tirukkalikanridāsar Algappirānar, Thōlappar Ayyangar of the Soṭṭai Tirumala Nambi family, Kumāra Tättayyangar, Srinivasa Tättayyangar, Kōti Kannikadanam Kumāra Tattayyangar, Anandālvar, Koyil Kandadai Annan, Kandaḍai Ramanuja Ayyangar, Kandaḍai Doddayyangar of Sholinghur, Prativadhi Bhayankaram Annan, Tiruvenkatachari (Chakravarthi family), Alagiya Manavala Jiyar, Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar, Emperumanar Jiyar and his successors, Van Sathagopa Jiyar and his successor Narayana Jiyar of the Ahobila Matham, Sri Vyasa Thirtha Sri Pada Udaiyar, Devaraja Bhattar of the Archaka family, the various members of the mercantile community of Tirupati (very many of whom have made large endowments), the temple accountants going by the name of Tiru. ninra-úr-Uḍaiyar, the dancing girls known as Emperumānaḍiyars attached to the temple in their numbers, all have made notable endowments at critical periods in the history of the temple.
One great experiment in softening the acerbities of social inequalities was made by them five centuries ago. The recitation of the Tiruvoimoli by the Dwijas and the non-Dwijas alike in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Shrine in Tirumala and sharing of prasadams on terms of equality was so long ago as 1467 A.D. introduced and practised. The non-Dwijas represented by the Sattada Sri Vaishnavas were accorded the privilege of making the daily offering with full paraphernalia of Parimalam&quot; used for the first function of the daily puja called Tirumanjanam (Abhishekam). These articles have been used for the holy bath and the emoluments given in return were received by them daily. Such a function seems to have no parallel in the history of any other temple. This will also be gone into at length later.
The inscriptions of the post-Talikota period show distinctly that royal patronage diminished or even disappeared. The only exceptions to this are the charities of Matla Kumāra Anantaraja, who built a number of temples and gopurams in Tirupati, Kalahasti. Nandalur, Kanchi, Tiruvallur etc., and endowed for several free feeding houses,. Almost all endowments have been made by private individuals and several of them belonged to the Acharyapurusha

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
families. During that period, money seems to have become so scarce that donors carried out the repairs to existing irrigation channels and excavation of a few new ones in return for which the Sthanattar undertook to perform certain services for the merit of the donor commensurate with the additional yield of grains secured by the repairs etc. In 1684, we find a donor Dabirshawgiving away a gold Kanthi at its market value as an endowment in place of cash. Villages were of course endowed.
Speaking of endowment of villages, it may be mentioned that about 200 of them were, or ought to have been, in possession of the Sthanattar scattered over wide tracts of the country. A detailed list of these with particulars will be given later. But from the middle of the 15th Century A.D. it was realised that the Sthanattar could not do justice to the job of supervision and collection of rents, which probably were in kind. A separate department known as the Tiruppani Bhandaram (Public works) was opened We have not been able to find out who were, or were not eligible to be, members of this committee. But we know that it functioned as a separate body, but in conjunction with the Sri Bhandaram. While the latter may be called the Finance Department, the former corresponds to the Department of Works (Buildings and Irrigation including collection of rents). Yet another had to be created about the end of the 15th century to be in charge of gold, bullion, jewellery, gold vessels, costly silks etc., and to see to their repairs and upkeep.1 But whatever other departments were created, there is no evidence anywhere in the inscriptions to show that the conduct of rituals and festivals was subject to the supervision and interference of any secular body. We may go further and state that there was perfect amity among the Sri Vaishnavas, whether engaged in the services or otherwise, in all ritualistic matters. It has already been pointed out that this went to the extent of admitting all Sri Vaishnavas, Dwijas, and non-Dwijas, to a due share in the performance of semireligious service and to sharing of emoluments. But this seems to have been confined to that section known as Sri Vaishnavas. When there appeared the possibility of even Dwijas of other religious persuasion legitimately claiming the right to partake in services,</li>
<li>Por-Bhandaram

OTHER SHRINES
such a service seems to have been sedulously and silently smothered. That appears to be the reason why Vedaparayanam service failed to take root in Tirumala. By common consent, it would look like the sharing of prasadams having been denied to them, while for the prabandhams recital there was liberal remuneration. This has been a dominant feature of this temple.
Before closing these introductory remarks, it is necessary to mention a few prominent points.
Other Shrines.
In Tirumala temple, there are separate shrines dedicated to Sri Varadarajaswami, Sri Ranganatha and Sri Narasimhaswami; whereas Sri Rama and Sri Krishna are accommodated inside in the pantheon. In none of the other premier temples (Kanchipuram or Srirangam) is there a corresponding provision for Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan. It is easy to explain. The shrines for Sri Varadaraja, Ranganatha and Narasimha came to be built about the second half of the 14th century at a time when the desecration and spoliation of Hindu idols and temples were in swing under Malik Kafur and Muhammad Toghluk. Tradition tells us that Ranganatha was accommodated for three or four decades in Tirumala. Although a shrine for Varadaraja was built some time before 1350 A.D.. it does not appear that the Kanchipuram idol was accommodated in Tirumala. We know that in 1481, the Muslim armies swooped down to the gates of the Kanchipuram temple, plundered all the jewels and massacred the Srivaishnavas there. There was likewise during all those days the risk of the Ahobilam Narasimhaswami temple being desecrated. Perhaps the God was for some time in Tirumala. We know from tradition that Adivan Sathagopa Swami took charge of the small idol (whom we would call the Mantra Salai Narasimham) and kept Him away from Ahobilam ever since in the Ahobila Mutt without a definite habitation for some centuries.
These are referred to for the purpose of informing readers that Tirumala served as a sort of refugee camp for Vaishnavite idols of antiquity.
The next item relates to Tiruvenkata Mahatmyam or Venkatachala Mahatmyam. It will be discussed at length separately.

65HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
But enough for the present to state that it could claim no more antiquity than 1491 A.D. It was composed, or compiled, by one Păsindi Venkatatturaivar and read with Arulappadu (or divine permission) in that year. Therefore all the traditions relating to Alamelmangai Thayar of Tiruchanoor must be taken with a pinch of salt. Sri Padmavati Amman (or Alamel Mangai of Tiruchanur) is nowhere referred to in our inscriptions. The presumptions of the T. T. Devasthanam epigraphist and his interpolations in brackets in the course of his translation of the original Tamil text are unwarranted. The Alamel Mangai referred to in the inscriptions distinctly points to Bhudevi on the left bosom or Vakshasthalam of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan. The word Alamel Mangai Nachchiar Sannidhi occurs for the first time only in 1477 A.D. and not before, although Pulugu Kāppu Murai for Tiruvengadamudaiyan was in vogue from much earlier times.
So are the terms Kapila Thirtham and Sri Kapileswara Swami Temple in reference to Alvar Tirtam in Tirupati. Nowhere in the text, until we reach the year 1865 A.D., does the term Kapila Tirtham appear and Sri Mahant Dharmadasji introduced that name. It was in the year 1563 A.D. that the God there is referred to as &ldquo;Kapileswar Nayinar.&rdquo; Before that date, there was no mention of a temple of that name, nor of the waterfall and the pond having been called Kapila Tirtham. In all the inscriptions, the waterfall goes by the name of Alvar Tirtham (the word Alvār having reference to Sudarsana Alvar or Chakrattalvar) since it is stated in one of the inscriptions that according to the rites prescribed by Sri Ramanuja the waters there were sanctified by the advent of Sri Govindarajaswami with Sri Devi, Bhu Devi and Chakrattāļvār. This matter also will be dealt with separately.
The subject matter of the inscriptions has been indicated in brief in this introduction. The temptation remains to put into a few sentences the important events connected with the history of this temple. A table of chronology will be added later showing in detail the salient events. But a brief account may not be unwelcome to many.
Apparently because Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan on the Hill was inaccessible to most devotees, and probably at the instance of
66
OTHER SHRINES
some of the Alvārs and more probably Tirumangai Alvar (when Sriman Natha Munigal and Uyyakkonḍār were yet in their teens) a Tiruvilankōyil was reared in Tiruchchokunur about the year which represented the 51st year of the reign of the Pallava King Vijaya Danti Vikrama Varman and a perpetual lamp to represent or symbolise the ever burning light of true knowledge was set up, the corresponding probable year of the christian era being about 826 A.D. With the downfall of the Pallava power in 900 A.D. and the advent of the Chola supremacy, a Siva temple also (Sri Paraareswara&rsquo;s temple) came into existence in the same place, possibly having the royal support. By about the year 960 A. D. when Srimad Yamuna Muni, the grandson of Sriman Nätha Muni and the great systematiser of Sri Vaishnava theology and Vaishnava Agamas, was at the height of his influence, it must have been considered an act of wisdom to transfer the worship of the Tiruvengaḍam God to His rightful place on the Hill so that all possible chances of a sectarian friction may be avoided. For, after all, Tiruvilankoyil idol was only a Deputy of the Hill God. A silver image, being the replica of the main idol, was made, the consecration duly performed and arrangements made for the daily conduct of worship, for two Brahmotsavams in the year and for the observance of certain calendar days. This may have been in 966 A.D. This was the period when Sri Alavandar and his grandson Tirumala Nambi were the Sri Vaishnava leaders. Sri Ramanuja was, or is said to have been, born only in 1017 A.D. Sri Ramanuja mus: have clearly seen that a temple and a God on the inaccessible Hill with very limited accommodation could not serve as a rallying place for Sri Vaishnava devotees. He must have had the ambition of a universal conversion to his faith. Just about that time, the Chola King, who was a Saivite, ordered that the image of Sri Govindaraja of Chidambaram should be thrown into the sea as the sea was the legitimate place of repose for Vishnu. This image was taken hold of, removed to Tirupati and the temple of Sri Govindaraja erected just to the right of Sri Parthasarathyswami as we face the shrine. The location of Sri Govindaraja shows clearly that he came in as a refugee. But the temple and Tirupati grew in importance, because the temple was from its inception affiliated to the Tirumala Temple. The place
67
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
served as a base for pilgrims to commence their journey up the Hill. Further it was the policy of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s successors to construct a number of subsidiary shrines affiliating them to the Hill temple, although each had its own resources to fall back upon. Also a clever move was set on foot, of sending down from Tirumala certain prasadams, such as Chandanam, Vastram, Appa padi, Tirtam etc., on the Sattumurai day of the respective presiding deity heralded by full temple paraphernalia, honours, Adhyapakam and Vēdapārāyana Gōshți and conveyed on the back of elephants in procession. It must always have been a grand sight and a gala day for pilgrims and the residents of Tirupati. The whole show contributed to make Tirumala and Tirupati famous. But during the days of Sri Ramanuja, such things had not taken definite shape. They came in at least two centuries after him. In fact there were no Alvārs or Acharyas inside the temple nor even in Tirupati during Ramanuja&rsquo;s days. Even the unfailing performance of routine worship seems to have been a doubtful matter till we reach the year about 1200 A.D.
It must have been about 1160 A.D. or soon after, that the foundations of the Gopurams in Tirumala (and perhaps in Tirupati also) were laid. The earliest inscription we find on the basement of the inner Gopuram may be assigned by inference to about 1180 A.D. The Yadavaraya Kings of Narayanavanam were the early and the great patrons of the temple, the greatest of them being Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya. It was during his days that the renovation of the Garbhagriham in a grand style (கோயிலாழ்வார்க்கு கோயிலுக்குகோயில்) was made and the gold gilt Vimanam and Kalasam were set up by him thus making the Tirumala temple rival Suragiri (Mount Meru) in brilliance. This was about in 1250 A.D. Under his eyes, the Tirupati temple also grew in importance, a four-faced car was built and a golden Kalasam was placed thereon.
New Festivals.
Then came the onrush of Malik Kafur&rsquo;s troops destroying and looting Hindu temples and idols. Upto this date Tirupati temples had only Brahmotsavams, seven in number month after month in Tirumala and two in Tirupati. There were some Tingal
68
NEW FESTIVALS
Divasams (sacred days) also observed. The destruction of temples in the south, and more the fear of such misdeeds, drove thousands of devout Hindus up to Tirumala and Tirupati which somehow (and naturally attributed to the power of Tiruvengadamudaiyan) escaped the iconoclast. This was all after 1300 A.D. and right up to 1360 A.D. These Tamils whose rituals of temple worship commenced long before the birth of Yamuna Muni and Ramanuja were well-versed in the Tiruvoimoli (Alwar Sri Suktis) and attached greater importance to their recital than that of Vedaparayanam. While before 1336 no trace of a processional deity and the two Nächimars can be seen in any of the inscriptions, thereafter they appear unfailingly in all processions. Processions, Asthānams, and Tiruvõlakkam (food offerings of varieties on a large scale intended for distribution) multiplied in numbers. New kinds of festivals in imitation of the practice in the South Tamil country were instituted-Hunting festival, Yachting or Floating festival, swing or Unjal festival, Pavitrõtsavam (the only sastraic one), Adhyayanōtsavam (recital of the entire Tiruvoimoli in 10 to 20 days), marriage festival for the God, Fruit eating festival (Phalotsavam), Sahasranāmōtsavam, Sahasrakalasabhishekam, festivals on calendar days such as new moon, full moon, Ekadasi, Dvādasi, Sankramanams etc, multiplied. Alvars and Acharyās and even one&rsquo;s own ancestors were given birth day celebrations and Sattumurai. So much so at the beginning of the 17th century A.D. there were 429 festivals for 365 days of the year. If ever there was a Vēdaparayanam, it ceased to be uttere until Devaraya Maharaya II thought it desirable to make a permanent arrangement for its recital, although according to ancient rule and custom, the Vedas should not be recited for iemuneration This was about 1443 A.D.
In the meantime, the result of the Muslim invasion was that the Yadavarayas and the Pandyas were wiped out and the Vijayanagar Kings stepped on the stage. Bukkaraya sought the blessings of Tiruvengadamudaiyan about 1365 A.D. by offering one Sandhi food and by instituting a Brahmotsavam. Saluva Mangideva, one of his feudatories in Chandragiri, gold-gilt the Vimanam of the Tirumala God for the second time in 1409 A. D. Devaraya made some substantial arrangements for food offerings in 1429 A.D. Saluva Narasimha, the trusted Minister and Commander-in-Chief
69
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of the Vijayanagar Kings till 1485, took the greatest interest in these temples. Under the advice of a Brahmin, Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyangar Narasimha converted them into a true copy of any of the South Indian Tamil Srivaishnava Temples, the introduction of the dancing girls not being excepted.
This period between 1450 and 1494 has its own merits and demerits, but the merits predominate. After some
not very eventful years, we pass on to the period of Sri Virapratapa, Vira Krishnadeva Maharaya, unequalled for his munificence, grandeur, freedom from sectarianism and the ease with which he kept himself above the influence of self-interested devotees. He showered gold, jewellery, pitambaras, costly vessels, covered the Viman with gold-gilt, never looked to his right or his left as to who took all that wealth or managed it in the name of God. He lost his only son and yet did not lose his faith in his own, his personal God Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan. He might have realised by then that washing himself and his blood-stained sword in Rameswaram could not wipe out the consequences of his many sins. Analysing all the emperors of the Vijayanagar Dynasties-others did very little for this temple in comparison-we find none second to his, unless it be the unostentatious Sadasivaraya Maharaya. Āliya Ramaraya, the King-maker, is represented in Telugu Kavyas as a depraved man and tyrant. But from our inscriptions, we must say that he was magnanimous with a sigh for the hard lot of the poor man.
Private endowments were always given in plenty for this temple. It should certainly be an interesting pastime for those responsible for the secular management of these temples to find out in what manner these endowments slipped out to the Devasthanam. They may learn a lesson for the future. That Hindu religious endowments have been a fruitful source for misappropriation and embezzlement, our inscriptions show to be only partially correct. Only in a few cases we find that a donor endows village; everything is intact excepting the name of the village which has been clean chiselled out. This is no plea for Government management which can and did with impunity perpetrate worse deeds.
70
SADĀSIVARAYA AND ALIYA RAMARAYA
Endowments were invariably burdened to the full with services to be rendered and food offereings to be made. When in some instances the income fell short of the requirements additional endowments were demanded and furnished.
Worship was free to every pilgrim. No fee was ever demanded. The aim was to provide food and shelter free to all pilgrims. It was only when the Muslim rulers assured ownership of the temples as an estate that the system of farming out the temple to a renter was introduced to provide income to the ruler. This was brought to light when the East India Company came forward to safeguard the income of the temple, which the Nawab of Arcot had mortgaged to the company, against depredations made by the Maharattas, the French and the free booters. As evils invariably take deeper root even after the causes which bred them originally are removed, the levy of fees for worship still continues in the name of the good administration of religious institutions.
After the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, private benefactors maintained the greatness of the institution till the Muslims, the Maharattas, and ultimately John Company came in as masters. The history of these periods is wrapped up in obscurity and could be written if the Govrenment of Madras will arrange for the study of records in its possession.

CHAPTER V
Tiruvengadam and Tiruchchokinur (or Tiruchchukanur)
EARLY ACCOUNTS
IN this chapter an attempt is made to trace the modus operandi of the early Vaishnavas of the Bhakti school to make the Vengadam Hill easily accessible to worshippers of Vishnu, and incidentally to gain popularity for the Pancharatra system of idol worship as contrasted with the Vaikhanasa system which was perhaps the more common one The difference between the two may be compared to the difference between the Anglican and the Reformed Church,or that between the Roman Catholics and the Protestants The Pancharatra made it posible for any brahmin of education, culture and character to get himself initiated as an archaka whereas the Vaikhanasa tenet reserved the privilege to brahmins born in the old Vaikhanasa family The base of operation nearest to Tirumala was Tiruchchokinur as Tirupati had not then come into existence An auxiliary temple was constructed there and a duplicate Tiruvengadamudaiyan was installed Conversion of Saivites into Vaishnavism was obviously cared on in a supplementary shrine where another image was set up to preside over the conversion ceremony By the time attempts were made by the Saivites to stem this tide by the construction of a temple for Siva in the same village (Sri Pat isaresvara or T.ppaladisvaramadaiyan) it was considered better to transfer the work to Tirumala itself by entering into some sort of an agreement with the Vaikhanasas there
Vengadam (or Tiruvengadam) is the name of the Hill according to the Tamil gramma &ldquo;Tolkappiyam &quot; The Sangam poct Mamulanar gives the same name to the Hill But the name of the Deity Tiruvengadamudaiyan (or any variant the cof) is not mentioned by either of the above, nor is the existence of any temple for any other Deity mentioned Mámůlanár seems to refer to festivals
72
TIRUVENGADAM AND TIRUCHCHOKINUR
and fairs thereon as being occasions for drunken bouts and for exchange of certain commodities by barter. The Tamil classical work &ldquo;Silappadhikaram&rdquo; gives a description of the Deity on the Vengadam Hill which early shows that the Deity is Vishnu. The Alvars have, as already pointed out earlier in this book, described the Deity as one having Siva also in Himself. Chronologically these are to be ascribed to the 8th Century A.D. or even earlier.
We have now to examine and find out what the mscriptions in Vengadam and Tiruchchokinur have to tell us on this subject. Tiruchchokinur is now brought in since the earliest inscriptionsthat is, all those that are found till we reach the date of the consecration of the Manavalapperumal in the Tiruvengadam Temple-are to be found only in Tiruchchokinur. The only exception to this is the solitary slab which was found as a stray piece in front of the Tiruvengadam temple. This contains an incomplete inscription commemorating the birth of one Vijayaditya whom we identify with one of the local Bana Rulers. As will be presently shown Vijayaditya might have been born about the year 790 A.D. The year of the consecration of Manavalapperumal as will be shown later, was much later than this. There is an interval of one and three-quarter centuries between the two during which period there are no inscriptions in Tirumala to tell us anything about the temple on the Hill.
There are however inscriptions which were found in Tiruchchōkinur and which give information about a temple there for Tiruvengadattupperumānadigal. There are eight inscriptions in Tiruchcho&rsquo; inur which relate to this period. These are numbered 1,2,4,5,6,7,12 and 13, in Vol. I. of the T.T. Devasthanam Inscriptions. No. 3 is the one which was found in Tirumala commemorating the birth of Vijayaditya. If we can find out the probable date of the birth of this Vijayaditya we will have found the date of this inscription. In the note attached to this chapter this date has been with tolerable accuracy fixed as 790 A.D. This will be about 40 years after the writing of the Tamil classic &ldquo;Silappadhikaram.&rdquo; From the description given in that work of the Deity in
73
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Tiruvengadam, we have to conclude that there might have existed in 756 A.D. a temple or structure which permitted the Sun and the Moon to shed their light on the figure of the Deity. Nor was it likely that a pukka temple was constructed between the years 756 A.D and 790 A.D. If there existed a structure, Vijayaditya&rsquo;s birth would have been commemorated on some portion of its walls, since he was the cherished (like the Sarika bird on earth) son of the Bana Ruler, Mavali Banaraya of the Vaḍugavalitwelve thousand within which Tiruvengadam was situated.
The earliest inscription found in Tiruchchōkinur was made in the 51st regnal year of Kōvijaya Dantivikramar. This we take to be 826 A.D. This inscription tells us in distinct terms that a proxy of Tiruvengaḍatupperum.inaḍigal existed in the Tiruvilankōyil at Tiruchchōkinur

The construction of
the phrase (in Tamil) is that the Tiruchchokinur Tiruvengadathu Perumanadigal was in existence there and that a Tiruvilankoyilperuman also was set up as a junior Murty (or Utsavar). The T.T.D. Epigraphist introduces the expression (as a representation of). The proper phrase would be to represent. The main point to note in this inscription is that a Tiruvilankoyil (or proxy temple) for the Tiruvengadam Deity was built and that a proxy Deity was set up. (The donor knew that it was not an independent temple with a Svayam vyakta Murti in it and that a proxy Deity only was set up for the convenience of people. There seem to be some who take the view that the Deity on the Hill was not known as Tiruvengadattupperuman, but only as Subramanya; and that the Deity in Tiruchchōkinur only was Tiruvengadattu Peruman. It is an assumption not warranted by the language used. The term Tiruchchokinur Tiruvengadattupperumanadigal would only go to show that he was not the Original Deity on the Vengadam Hill, but only a copy thereof. There were temples dedicated to Tiruvengadattupperuman in other places also. There would have been a Mula Murti set up in Tiruchchokinur and a processional Deity would also have been set up some time later as is stated in the inscription. Sōlanāṭṭu Ulagap-

perumānār made a cash endowment in gold for setting up a perpetual lamp before the Tiruvilankoil Perumanadigal (or the Utsava Murti).
In addition to these two Murtis, there is a third one also mentioned in the endowment made by Vijayaditya, the Tirumantrasalai Permanadigal. The last named may have been set up later than 826 A.D. and before the date of Vijayaditya&rsquo;s endowment whose date is missing owing to the first part of the inscription being not on the stone. But it may be safely assumed to be about 870 A.D. Vijayaditya was the ruler ad therefore had the power to set apart the income realised through the Bayyan Kō.l, whatever that term may connote. From this inscription we learn that there was a Ur-niyogam or village council, that the temple was managed by a Kōyirkōn and that the head of the servants in the temple was called Valluvakkōn. Three distinct murtis are mentioned, the Tiruvalankoil Perumanaḍigal, the Tirumantra Sälai Perumanaḍigal and the Tiruvenkatattupperumanadigal. From the fact that the Mula Murti is mentioned last, there is room for the assumption that the first two referred to the local Deities and the last to the God on the Tiruvengadam Hill. If the last one really referred to the Tiruchchokinur Mula Murti, mention should have been made of that Deity first, the other two coming
next.
Regarding the Tirumantira Salai Perumanaḍigal, an endowment by one Gunavan Aparajitan, head of the Irungōlas or irungōlakkōn, gives some information. We gather that Brahmins were being fed in that temple. Tirumantra Salai is, as the name indicates, the temple or shrine where the new convert to the Vaishnava faith was initiated into the Ashṭākshara or Tirumantram. It therefore happened to be the place where the convert was also provided with food for the day. The endowment made by Guṇavan Aparajitan was for feeding two Brahmins daily, not necessarily Vaishnavas. Since the Pallava sovereignty came to an end with Aparajitan, we may take it that his vassal Gunavän made the endowment some time before 900 A.D., may be about 880 A.D. How the Tiruv lankōyil was kept going immediately after the downfall of the Pallava Dynasty and before the Chola
75HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
rule asserted itself, can be seen from an inscription dated Saka 824, (5 or 902A.D.).The Ayirakkādi and the Oratchi who were the administrative officers of Tiruchchokinur decided that the net income received from the administration of the village after defraying the expenses for the customary and obligatory services, should be utilised for the Tiruvilankoyil. This is obviously an extraordinary step which they had to take as the normal administration had broken down. This shows that the village council or assembly shouldered the responsibility of administration in a case of emergency.
The necessity for and the function of a Tirumantra sālai may well be more fully explained. In our days we are accustomed to have what are known as the Pancha Bēram in a temple. There Is the Mula Murti who is the immovable idol. There is also the portable Utsavamurti along with the two consorts (Nachchimars) for festival purpose. There are three others also, Kautuka, Snapana and Bali Berams, for certain specific functions. The early centuries of our inscriptions concern a period of Vishnu temple worship anterior to the days of Sri Alavandar, and more so of Sri Ramanuja. The present Agama form of worship was codified by Sri Alavandar, as far as we can understand.
Tiruvilankoyil.
The Tiruvilankoyil and the Tirumantra salai are mentioned only during that early period and not later. We have already explained the term Tiruvilankoyil as a proxy temple representing and next in importance to the original temple. An analogous term is Ilavarasu or Ilayaraja. Tiruvilankoyil should not be confounded with the term Bälälayam. Balalayam denotes a temporary structure created for transferring thereto the Divinity enshrined in the main Deity and his Koyil-alvar (Garbha Griham) during the period that any repairs may have to be carried. As soon as the repairs are finished there is a retransference to the Divinity to the original Murti. When a new Murti is to be set up there will be no room for a Balalaya Murti. The new Murti will however
be enshrined in a Koyil or Koyilalvar which along with the Murti
76
TIRUVINGADAM AND TIRUCHCHOKINUR
will be duly consecrated. If it is only a proxy or junior Murti who will be added, a Tiruvilankoil will be built and consecrated along with that Murti, if the intention of the donor is to maintain that Murti separately. Balalayam and Tiruvilankoyil should not therefore be equated. A Tiruvilankoyil need no. necessarily be a building with walls all round and with doorway. It may as well be a mantapam, with in some cases walls on either side, the front and rear being left open. If one would look at the plan of the Garbhagriham, the Pradakshinam around it and the front mantapam flanked by the Pradakshinam walls, in the Tirupati Govindarajaswami temple the idea of a Tiruvilankoyil will be clear. For purposes of certain festivals including Snapana Tirumanjanam, the Utsava Murti with Nachchimar will be accommodated in that mantapam. It will be a Tiruvilankoyil during the function. In the case of Tirumala temple, the Sthapana mantapam, the proper name being Snapana mantapam, functioned as the Tiruvilankoyil till the commencement of the 15th century A.D. when the Tirumāmani Mantapam was constructed. Throughout the Brahmotsavam period the Utsava Murti would have been there alone, that is to say for months till the Deepavali Asthanam. In more recent times the Kalyana Mantapam came into use as the Tiruvilankoyil. Tiruvilankoyil does not carry with it the same sense of sanctity as Koyil alvar, or Garbhagriham. Any mantapam can be made a Tiruvilankoyil by a simple Samprokshana.
Tirumantirasalaipperuman.
In the early days one of the main functions of the leaders of Vaishnavism was to convert the Saivites to Vaishnavism. It is a well known fact that branding on the forepart of the shoulders with the Chakram and Sankham marks was a necessary function before being initiated into the Tirumantram or Ashtaksharam. He must be an acknowledged and accredited Acharya who can do this. Tradition tells us that Tirumala nambi gave his two sisters in marriage only after the intended bridegroom embraced Vaishnavism and went through the ceremony of branding and initiation into Ashtakshara. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s father is one of the two. We know that Sri Ramanuja created a band of 72 persons.
77
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
known as Simhāsanādhipatis who were given the authority and the power to carry on this proselytising work. But our inscriptions relate to a period which may be at least two centuries anterior to Sri Ramanuja. The procedure adopted at that time seems to be that the function took place in the presence of the Deity in the Tirumantrasälai. The Sudarsana and the Panchajanya blocks used for the branding would have been duly consecrated and in enjoyment of the daily puja to the Deity. It is only such a consecrated instrument that would have been permitted to be used for the ceremony. After the daily Tiruvaradhanam was over the branding would take place. In all the Sri Vaishnava Mathams there is a presiding Deity and the Sudarsana and Panchajanya also share the daily puja. The Acharya-purushas who have been doing this work have likewise been doing puja to some Murti or other and the Sudarsanam and Panchajanyam would find a place in the pantheon. After Sri Ramanuja organised his School of Acharyas. there was no need for a Tirumantrasalai in temples. But before his days there were only a few recognised Acharyas; the temple was therefore the most accredited place. Even to this day this kind of branding takes place in Tirumala by the seven recognised Acharya Purushas of the Temple during the Brahmotsavam.
We can now have a clear picture of the three Murtis (with perhaps a separate temple for each) existing in Tiruchchokinur at the time of the downfall of the Pallava supremacy and the establishment of that of the Cholas.
There are two more of the Tiruchchokinur inscriptions which give room for doubtful interpretation. These are in the early period of the Chola rule and probably of the years 935 and 927 A.D. Inscription No. 12 was made in the 29th regnal year of Kōparakesari Panmar (Parantaka I).
It reads &lsquo;&lsquo;மதிரை கொண்ட கொப்பர கேசரி பன்மற்கு யாண்டு இருபத்தொன்பதாவது திருவேங்கட-&rsquo;&rsquo;
(2)க்கு ஒன்றினுக்கு திருவேங்கடக சொட்டத்து குடவூர் நாட்டு திருசோகினூர் ெெஹ
It ends with &ldquo;.ெெஹயோம் எம்பெருமானடியார் QQ54&rdquo;.
78
TIRUVENGADAM AND TIRUCHCHOKINUR
The 29th regnal year is 935 A.D. One Koḍungōlūrān(&lsquo;Qir☎rả Gang) of Malainadu made an endowment of 40 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in front of Tiruvenkata, and the amount was received by the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchok&rsquo;nur for due performance of the trust. The inscription breaks off at Tiruvenkata and leaves us in doubt whether it was for Tiruchchokinur Tiruvenkata or the Tiruvenkata on the Hill that the trust was meant. The doubt arises for the reason that all the inscriptions previous to this date (i.e., 935 A.D.) show that the managers of the temple (Sri Karyam) were taking charge of such endowments, and the endowments were for the Tiruchchokinur Temple. The powers of the manager of the temple would be limited to the affairs of that temple. When, as in this case, the Sabhaiyars step in as trustees the presumption would be that the trust was meant for a temple outside the jurisdiction of the managers of the Tiruchchokinur Temple. The only other Tiruvenkata was on the Vengadam Hill. This theory is based on the assumption that the Sabhaiyar co-existed with the managers of a temple, and appears to be correct from a reading of inscriptions Nos. 8 and 9 (Vol. I) of the same Chola&rsquo;period, where the Sabhaiyar and the managers of the temple of Vengadam are mentioned side by side. If our surmise is correct, then we glean for the first time that there was a temple on the Vengadam Hill in 935 A.D., where a perpetual lamp could have safely burnt. Also that the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchokinur had the responsibility to look after its affairs.
There is also another piece of information which appears in clearer terms than in a previous inscription. In the latter which deals with an endowment for burning perpetual lights, the word Emperuman adiyī appearsin a broken form (எப் பெருமானடியோ) It is not clear whether Emperumanadiyars refers to some agency which looked after the due performnace of the charity. In the inscription we are now considering (1, 12 of 935 A.D.) the inscription closes with the expressionஎம்பெருமானடியார்ரக்ஷை&quot;EmperumanadiarRakshai&rsquo;&rsquo; who are therefore expected to protect the trust. This term obviously is intended to denote those who were devotees of Emperuman</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
whether Vishnu in general, or the particular Deity Tiruvenkatattupperuman. This term marks one phase in the history of Vaishnavism. We will see that a quarter of a century later, this phrase yields place to &ldquo;Sri Vaishnava Rakshai&rdquo; when Samavai consecrated the Silver Idol of Manavälapperumal in the Vengadam Temple in 966 A.D. Inscription No. 13 is probably of the date 927 and might refer to the Hill Temple.
As we are now studying the Tiruchchokinur inscriptions we will take up all the incomplete ones available. Inscriptions No. 15 and 17 refer to some endowments made by one Arulakki, alias Raja Raja Mūvēnda Vēlan. Being incomplete slabs we are not in a position to learn what the endowments were. But they were made when Raja Raja I was the Chola Emperor and therefore must have been between 985 and 1013 A.D. and the endowments may have been for the Deity in Tiruchchokinur either in the Vishnu or the Siva temple. The next one of which we can make some sense is of the 4th regnal year of Raja Raja III (1220 A.D.).1 According to that inscription (incomplete one) Pokkāran Pandya daraiyan made an endowment for the Vaikasi festival of Alagiya perumal (in Tiruchchukanur obviously). There is thus a gap of over 200 years between the last one and this. Another inscription2 of about the same time (may be 1225 A.D.), although an incomplete one has enough words to show that Andar&rsquo;s son made a gift of land somewhere in Perumbanappadi to the Tiruvilanko-for the spiritual benefit of Narayana who died some ume ago while fighting for Yadava Rayar. The battle of Uratti is obviously referred to, which took place in 1223 A.D.
There are three more incomplete inscriptions which may be referred to the same period when Pandiyadaraiyar was the Pokkaran and the manager of the Siva Temple in Tiruchchokinur. These are I. 95, 96 and 97. The first and the third are on the west and the east wall of the Vahana Mantapam and the second on the east Prakaram wall adjoining the Gopuram of Sri Padmavati Amman&rsquo;s temple. They will be between 1230-1240 A.D. The first one</li>
<li>I. 34</li>
<li>141
80
TIRUVENGADAM AND TIRUCHCHOKINUR
mentions an endowment of some land, whose location is clearly described, for the Nitya Utsavam of Emperuman. The second one is not intelligible. The third one seems to be an endowment by Pandiyadaraiyar perhaps for Tiruvilankoil in the shape of grain and cash to be enjoyed by the Emperumanadiyar and the four gōtras (people) during Panguni Festival. There is next an inscription which refers to a Ubhaiyam (I. 108) which a number of persons, viz. (Pallava) rayan Yadavaraya Vilupparaiyan, Sola Vilupparaiyan, Trikartarayan and also the Kaikkõlar and Emperumānaḍiyar1, had undertaken to perform. The temple treasury is referred to as Sri Bhandaram. It ends with Sri Vaishnava Raksha. We cannot possibly fix the year, although from the language and contents, the year must be later than 1240 A.D.
a
Lastly, there are eight more fragmentary inscriptions all found in Tiruchchukanur. Of these No. 129 is probably the earlier and is on the east wall north of the Padikavali Gopuram. It mentions 40 Kalanju of gold. The word &ldquo;Deverku&rdquo;
occurs and may refer to Tiruvengada Devar. It ends with Emperumanadiyar Raksha. We know that this subscription was in use about 935 A.D. We also know that the term Tiruvenkata Devar was being used by the early Cholas (as in I. 19). The date of this inscription would therefore be before 966 A.D. when the phrase Sri Vaishnava Raksha came first into use. Inscriptions Nos. 127 and 128 are of interest in that they mention Sri Vaishnavas of eighteen Nādus&rsquo;&lsquo;பதினெட்டு நாட்டுஸ்ரீ வை&rdquo;. No. 128 ends with ஷெவரெெச. The date must therefore be after 966 A.D.Inscriptions Nos.118 to 122 all seem to refer to a period anterior to 1000 A.D. No. 118 mentions of the Srikaryam people and the Tiruvilankoyil and would therefore refer to a date before 900 A.D.
We have thus every reason to suspect that the Tiruvilankoyil in Tiruchchukanur began to decline after 1000 A.D. although as a building the Tiruvilankoyil continued to exist. We also notice that a new Alagiya Perumal came into existence. Later still we come to notice the existence of a Varadarajapperumal.</li>

CHAPTER VI.
The Temple of Sri Parasareswara in Tiruchchukanur.
IN the introductory chapter or synopsis it was stated that
the silver replica of Tiruvengadamudaiyan was consecrated in Tirumala with a view to avoiding any possible source of friction between the Saivites and the Vaishnavites, since a temple for Siva, known as Sri Parasaresvaraswami, was constructed sometime after the Tiruvilankoyil in Tiruchchukanur. There is no mention anywhere that tension existed between the two sects at that period in Tiruchchukanur. It was also pointed out as the result of a close study of the wording of some inscriptions, that the Vaishnavite temple was doing proselytising work and therefore open to all and that feeding also was open to members of both sects on equal terms. There was therefore the possibility of friction and the astute Vaishnavas of the day wanted to eliminate all chances of such friction arising at a future date. Right up to the days of Sri Ramanuja, however, there was no sign of such friction. There is a well known story that one day when Sri Ramanuja, as one of the students of the Advaitin Sri Yadavaprakasa, was anointing the head of his guru with oil for a bath, Yadavaprakasa gave what was, on the face of it, a blasphemous interpretation of a portion of the Chandogya Upanishad, &ldquo;Tasyayathā kapyasam pundarikam evam akshini&rdquo; in reference to the Purusha who is</li>
<li>It was Sankara&rsquo;s interpretation of the words in verse 7 of Chandoğya Upanishad section I that brought tears from the eyes of Ramanuja when he was studying under Yadavaprakasa Sankara attached to the word &lsquo;kapyasa&rsquo; the meaning, the parts around the postial calosities of the monkey. (Kapyasa: from Kapi-monkey and Asi-to sit). Translated into English Sankara&rsquo;s interpretation of verses 6 and 7 conveys the meaning (in speaking of the Purusha seated inside the Sun), Of this Male, whose whole body is Bolden there is some distinction in the eyes. They are red like unto lotuses which are bright, as the parts around the postial calosities of the monkey&quot;. It is quite out of accord with the highly metaphysical plane of the disquesition and, to say the least, indecent. Ramanuja would have considered it blasphemous to compare the colour of the eyes of the Purusha who is presumed to reside in the Sun to the colour of a monkey&rsquo;s postial calosities.
82
SRI PARASARESWARA IN TIRUCHCHUKANUR
in the Sun, which brought tears from the eyes of the disciple and which fell on the thigh of the guru. The latter looked up and quickly understood the cause. This must have been when Sri Ramanuja was about 18 years of age (in 1035 A.D.). There were a few more similar instances which brought about estrangement between the student and his guru but there never was however any unpleasant act done on either side. As a tit for tat there is the story that Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s disciple Kūrattālvän appeared under orders before the Chola King Kulottunga I, for affixing his signature to the statement Sivät paratarm nästi.&quot; The silly meaning which Kūrattāļvan gave to the word &lsquo;Siva&rsquo; saying that there was a Dronam (measure) bigger than that, enraged the King who had his eyes put out. Sri Ramanuja and his disciples left Choladesa thereafter and resided in the Hoysala country (Mysore) until the death of
66
The accepted interpretation of the same by the Vaishnava commentators and by Ramanuja is. &ldquo;His eyes are like the lotus flower newly opened to the sun&rsquo;s rays&rdquo;. The two verses 6 and 7 would read in English&rsquo; &lsquo;Now that golden Purusha, who is seen within the sun with golden beard, with golden hair and Bolden in every part of the body up to the tip of His nails(verse 6). His eyes are like the lotus flower newly opened to the sun&rsquo;s rays&hellip;&hellip;..&quot;
The term &lsquo;Kapya sa&rsquo; of which the last sentence above is the translation is explained in three ways.
D
(1) Kapi is the sun who drinks water i.e. evaporates it; Kapya sa is what is opened by him;
(ii) Kapi is the stalk for the same reason and the flower stands thereon.
(iii) The whole word means standing in water. All these derivations are accepted ones and the resulting meaning is, &lsquo;as the lotus lower standing in deep water on its stalk and newly opened to the sun&rsquo;s rays is very pretty&rsquo;
The world &lsquo;pundarika&rsquo; according to &ldquo;Amarakosa&rdquo; is white lotus. But Sabara the commentator of Jaimini&rsquo;s sutras, applies it to the red lotus. In substance the idea seems to be &ldquo;that His eyes were like unto the lots flower just blossoming (on its stalk rising from deep water) to the red rays of the rising sun and displaying a blend of the red colour around the edges of the petals shading into white in the middle.
Rajaram Takkaram Tatya in his English translation of the twelve principal Upanishads renders it thus&rdquo; whose eyes are like unto lotuses red as the orb of the rising God of day.&quot; This is much the same as the Vaishnavite rendering.
83
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Kulottunga I. But for these two equally impudent wordy insults, there does not appear to have been any serious conflict such as we read in history of the rivalry between the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church, nor anything like the mortal fear of the Church which made Copernicus delay publication of his book till he was actually on his death bed, nor the Inquisition which Galileo had to face for refusing to disclaim faith in his astronomical theories. The assemblies of our pundits at all times reverberated with high sounding words and phrases in earnest disputation, called Väkyärtham, about the interpretation of a particular &ldquo;Sūtram&rdquo; in the Brahma Sutras. But this did not weaken mutual respect. Sayanacharya, the great commentator of the Vedas, was a contemporary of Vedanta Dēsika, the effective expounder of Ramanuja&rsquo;s Sri Bhashya. He was invited by Sayana to the court of the Vijayanagar King (Bukka) so that Desika may shed his poverty. The latter declined the offer in his famous five verses &ldquo;Vairagya Panchakam&rdquo; and preferred independence and &ldquo;uncha vritti&rdquo; (begging in the manner laid down in the sastras). Appayya Dikshitar, a great expounder of Advaita Philosophy, is said to have written a beautiful commentary on one of Desika&rsquo;s works. Mutual admiration never ceased; but rivalry to establish one&rsquo;s own point of view there was, and accompanied by indignation also. This anecdote carries us to about 1367 A.D. when Vedanta Desika seems to have died. But so far as the Saiva and Vaishnava temples in Tiruchchukanür were concerned we notice one instance of discord in each case. An endowment for lighting 24 lamps daily in Tiruvengadam Temple (incised on stone) for which the Sabhaiyar of Tirumunḍiyam (near Tiruchchanur) were trustees was not performed and the matter had to be enquired into by the Chola Raja&rsquo;s (Rajendra Sōla) Adhikari and the defaulters were properly dealt with. This action was about the year 1013 A.D.1 The Tiramundiyam Sabhaiyar were probably the Saivite counterpart of the Vaishnavite Tiruchchukanur Sabhaiyars.
In 1225 A.D. (I. 36) the Sthanattar of Sri Parasareswara&rsquo;s temple alleged that the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur with whom 26 Kalanju of gold was deposited in 1008 A.D. as an endowment</li>

for certain services in that temple failed to carry out the trust. They were made to shell out the money and the Sthanattar of he Siva Temple were made the trustees. In both instances the original inscriptions appear to have been willfully destroyed.
We do not find any other instance of friction. That about, or some time before, the year 1000 A.D. there was some friction is evidenced by the two incidents mentioned in our inscriptions. The reader will now see the wisdom of the Vaishnava leaders of the time in transferring their activities to Tiruvengaḍam Hill, practically abandoning the Tiruchchukanur Tiruvilankoyi!. In a small village the two temples of rival sects could not have worked in healthy co-operation. It is very necessary to go into the history of the temple of Sri Parasareswara to feel convinced of their wisdom.
It has been already pointed out that the Tiruvilankoyil Vishnu Temple should have been constructed some time before 826 A. D.1 in Tiruchchukanur. The earliest inscription which has reference to the Siva temple is on the walls of that temple itself, in the 23rd year of Sri Rajakēsari Rāja Rāja Dēva (1008 A.D.). There is thus a gulf of nearly 182 years between the two. The natural inference would be that the Siva temple should have been constructed not long before 1008 A.D. The inscription is incomplete here. But there is the other inscription (1. 36.) made in the ninth year of the reign of Rāja Rāja Dēva III (1225 A.D.) wherein the inscription of 1008 A.D. is reproduced in full. The latter is a complaint made before Vira Narasinga Yadavarayar against the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur (already referred to) for failure to carry out the provisions of the endowment, viz., the supply of the necessary articles for Tirumanjanam (Abhishekam) on the Uttarayana Sankramanam day and rice, tamarind, curds, honey, sesamam, pepper, turmeric sidari, chandanam, tender coconuts, sugar, greengram and betel nuts and leaves. Also 108 earthen pots and kalasams. If in 1008 A.D. this temple had been of any importance the endowment would have been not only for the Uttarayana Sankramanam, but also for the Dakshinayana and the two Vishus as well, similar to Samavai&rsquo;s endowment of 966A.D. while installing the Manavalapperumal in Tiruvengadam.</p>

85HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The history of South India indicates that the Chola Aditya I. conquered the Pallavas about 900 A.D. The latter while not making any direct endowment for the Vishnu or Siva temple in Tiruchchukanur, appear to have encouraged their feudatories and others to help to establish the Vishnu temple. With reference to the Siva Temple of Sri Parasaresvara (Tippaladisvaramudaiyan) there does not appear to have been any such encouragement even between 1008 and 1073 A.D., i.e., after the Cholas came to power. Although there is no reference in our inscriptions to Sri Kalahastisvara, it is fair to presume that it is an ancient one and was in a flourishing condition, at least in the first quarter of the 11th century. For, from Vaishnava tradition itself it is known that Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s cousin, Govinda Bhattar, became a convert to Saivism and lived in Kalahästi for several years before he was re-converted to Vaishnavism by his maternal uncle Tirumala Nambi. But, that the temple of Tippalaḍisvaramudaiyan received no endowment for nearly seventy years after 1008 A.D. when the Saivite Chola Kings were ruling, goes to show that it was not considered at the time a temple of importance. In the inscription of 1073,&rsquo; Sri Virarājēndra Sōla Dēva (Kulottunga I) among his other birudus adds &lsquo;Venkatanatha purandara&rsquo; showing that he was equally a devotee of Tiruvenkaṭanātha as of Siva. From this inscription it is seen that Munjaippundi (modern Mullapudi) was already a devadanam village of Tippaladisvaramudaiyan and that one Narana Deva waived collection of taxes, such as Vaṭṭakkāsu, Tirugukkasu etc., in favour of the temple. Next in 1094 A.D. (24th year of the reign of Kulottunga I) one Tiruchchirṛambala nambi presented to the care of certain Saivite Brahmins, who were hereditary archakas or Gurukkals of Tippaladisvaramudaiyan temple, 128 cows to supply ghee for 4 nandavilakku (at the rate of 32 cows for one lamp). The next one is more interesting because it brings to light the procedure for converting a land paying taxes to the state into a devadānam one. Five maḍai representing arrears due (or fee perhaps )had first to be paid before the Maganikkangatti (64) would give effect to the King&rsquo;s oral orders to convert Munjaippundi (re-named as Sivapādakēsarinallür in honour ofthe king)into a devadanam village free of all taxes.

also brings to light that in addition to the Sabhaiyar there was also a Ganattar (or assembly) of Siva Brahmins in Tiruchchukanur. In 1134 A.D. (16th year of the reign of Vikrama Sola)1 we notice for the first time that there was a Vaikasi festival instituted and that an arrangement was made for the supply of oil for lights during processions in Vaikasi Tirunal. Thus a Vaikasi festival had come into existence between 1105 and 1134. But it was not until 1223 A.D. (7th year of the reign of Raja Raja III) that permanent arrangements were made for the Tiruvardhajāmampaḍi and Tiruveluchchippadi (food offerings in the night and in the early morning daily). Some lands under cultivation were purchased and handed over to the members of three families who were doing puja in the temple by one Pandiyadaraiyar for the spiritual benefit of his son who lost his life in the Uratti battle. Details of daily rations to be supplied by the Bhattars are also given. By this time we find hereditary temple accountants also appointed. The trustees for this endowment are not the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur, but the Siva Brahmins (Bhattars) above referred to. There is thus a stage of clear cleavage between the Vaishnavite Sabhaiyars and the managers of the Siva Temple. Before we reach the year 1225 A.D. this temple had its own Sthanattar and an assembly called Sri Maheswaras. The gist of the inscription (I. 36) is a complaint before Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya against the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur by the Saivites above mentioned that in 1008 A.D. an endowment was made (in an inscription) for the performance of certain services. The Sabhaiyars contended that they were not aware of any such inscription. After due enquiry the King ordered that the Sabhaiyars should place into the hands of the Sthanattars of the Siva Temple, 26 kalanju of gold and that the Sthanattars should thenceforth become the trustees of the endowment.
From the above account it will be seen that the Vaishnavites from the date of founding of a Saivite temple apprehended the possibility of friction and therefore removed the centre of their religious activities to Triuvengadam Hill.
One more endowment was made by Pandiyadaraiyar who was managing the Siva Temple, for the celebration yearly</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of a Masi festival, by assignment of land therefor. (1. 38, 1240 A.D.).
After 1240 A.D. there is no inscription relating to this temple obviously because the Chola power in this part of the country came to an end before 1248 A.D. and there was a showdown. In 1547, A.D. the Tirumala Temple was paying 3 panams per month as wages for a man to supply flowers daily. .
There is, and there naturally can be, no inscription which would state why the Tiruvilankoyil had for all practical purposes to be abandoned and the Vaishnava activities centred in Tirumala itself. The Chola rule was in full swing and all the Chola Kings were staunch Saivites. There was therefore no wisdom in sticking to Tiruchchukanur. We have only to read between the lines to explain the most important step which the Vaishnavites of the day took. At that time Sri Alavandar was steering the ship in the Tamil country for the spread of Vaishnavism and he must have advised the Sri Vaishnavas to transfer their activities to Tirumala.
But before taking leave of the temple of Tiruppalādisvaramudaiyan, there are a few interesting things to learn about the system of administration adopted by the Chola Kings. There was an Adhikari in charge of each division who carried with him a sort of circuit court; all disputes referred to him seem to have been enquired into on the spot, after summoning and hearing the parties as well as the witnesses. Judgment seems to have been delivered on the spot. Even if the king issued an order to convert a tax paying land into a &ldquo;devadāna sarvamanya,&rdquo; the officer in charge took care to realise all arrears of tax before giving effect to the King&rsquo;s order.
The Siva temple had a manager to do the maḍapatyam. There were also the Sthanattar, the Ganattar and the Tiru-ulnālikai Bhattar, who actually did the service. The charges for endowment for burning one lamp was a cash payment of twenty four kalanju of gold or the award of 32 cows.
During the Chola period, and in the Siva Temple in particular, rice was measured with what was known as Arumoļidēvan measure
88
SRI PARASARESWARA IN TIRUCHCHUKANUR
in kalams, tūni, kuruni (), nāli and padakku. Weighment was in palams; betel leaves were in bundles and betel nuts were counted. The gold coins were the kalanju and manjadi and mādai. Gold was weighed in two styles, one known as Kuḍinaikkal and the other Dharmakkaṭṭalai.
The Arumolidēvan measure takes after the surname of Raja Raja I, which describes him as one who never swerved from what he once uttered. Alongside of the newly introduced standards of weights and measures, there were the old ones of the owners of the soil; tümbu, vatți, soligai etc. These will be dealt with in a separate chapter on weights, measures for grains, measurement of land etc.
There are taxes mentioned-Kadamaiyāyam, Porkaḍamai, Paḍikaval, Vettisarikai, Kolvari and Silvari.
It is also worth pointing out how the inscriptions relating to the Siva temple ended. In 1073 A.D. we find the subscription &ldquo;Sri Mahēsvara Rakshai.&rdquo; In cases where the pujaris of the temple were the trustees of the endowment, the ending is &ldquo;Kōil Tiruvunṇāligai Siva brahmanaōrm.&rdquo;
But from 1134 A.D.onwards it is
66
(Panma-
hēsvara Rakshai), which is the counter part of Sri Vaishnava Rakshai.&quot; The abandonment of &quot; Sri Mahesvara&quot; and the adoption of &ldquo;Pan Mahesvara&rdquo; (all mahesvaras) suggests that there were different sub-sects even in Saivism at that time.

CHAPTER VII.
Tiruvengadamudaiyan and the Tiruvengadam Temple.
WHEN we read or hear that a temple was built, the idea conveyed
to us is that a building of cut-stone was constructed, that an idol of stone was made and that it was duly installed and consecrated in that building. But when we speak of the Tiruvengadam Temple we believe that the Temple only was built by some one, that the Idol was already there and that it was neither made by man nor consecrated by him. The tradition about this is that at the time when Dvaparayuga ended and Kaliyuga set in Sriman Narayana in Vaikuntam of His own will deemed it desirable to manifest Himself as an Idol standing near the shore of a pond (since known as Svamipushkarini) on the Tiruvengadam Hill. The reason for this as vouchsafed by our ancients is that during the preceding yugas men were endowed with great powers of physical endurance for performing yoga and tapas as means to spiritual ends. These ends were Atmävalōkanam or self-realisation and Brahmavalōkanam or God-realisation. Atmavalokanam is beset with the danger of the aspirant acquiring such great powers of control over nature as may be considered an end itself and the existence of a higher power may be ignored or disregarded. Hiranya and Mahabali are examples of those who erred in this manner. Brahmavalōkanam alone reveals that the source of all power is God. To enable men in the Kali age to achieve God realisation a less tedious process, that is by intense love and devotion or Bhakti, has been recommended by God Himself who revealed Himself as an Idol. This is known as His Archāvatāra. All the faculties of man and his sense organs are directed to worshipping the Idol with intense love and devotion. Sri Andal is held up by Srivaishnavas as one who by such means attained God-realisation and absorption into the Godhead. It is purely a matter of faith that the Idol on the Tiruvengadam Hill is regarded as manifestation of Sriman Narayana and the Hill is considered as Kaliyuga Vaikuntam.
90
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
THE FIRST DISCOVERY.
But when the Idol was first discovered the scene was not the same that we witness now. The Idol is stated to have lain buried inside an ant hill, or mound of earth. The story goes that in that age there lived on the Hill a small colony of cowherds, that they noticed that their milch cows were returning home every day with empty udders, that when they followed the cows they found them going up to a mound and emptying their udders of milk at a particular spot and that when the phenomenon was reported to the king whose name was Tondaiman he had the mound removed and, finding to his amazement an Idol under it, built a temple to house the Idol. Some historians are of the opinion that this Tondaiman Chakravarti lived in the first century B.C. or A.D. If their opinion is correct a temple would have been built at that period. Whether that temple was of cut-stone, brick-inmortar, brick-in-mud or of wood we are not told.
Such a story is not wholly unbelievable. There is for instance a universal belief among Jews and Christians that God appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai and revealed to him the Ten Commandments that these were transcribed on the spot on two tablets of stone and deposited in a wooden box 4 feet x2 feet plated with gold. This box is known as the Ark which became the object of worship of the Jews. And it is stated that under the command of God king Solomon built about the year 1000 B.C. a grand temple to serve as a permanent place of rest for it. Hindus unquestioningly believe that in Tiruvengadam a similar miracle took place and that Tondaiman built a temple. But the temple we see today is not the one built by Tondaiman. The present temple is built of cut-stone with carvings in what is believed to be the Pallava style of architecture. The doors alone are of wood. Epigraphists assert that cut-stone architecture in South India developed only after the sixth century A.D. and that rock-cut cave temples found here and there were their precursors. There are numerous inscriptions which support this theory. Tondaiman&rsquo;s temple could therefore not have been of a durable type.
91
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Account of the Temple found in Silappadhikaram.
There is a description of the Vengadam Deity in the ancient Tamil classical work Silappadhikaram. The author of this work was not a worshipper of Vishnu. He is supposed to have been a Jain. He puts into the mouth of a Vaishnavite pilgrim from a village named Mängädu on the western ghat Hills a description of Tiruvengadamudaiyan and also another description of Sri Ranganatha of Sri Rangam. The description shows that the idol on the Hill represented Vishnu (called by him Sengan Nediyon (செங்கண நெடியோன ). The extract is given in full at the end of this chapter with a commentary in English on the import of the description. It shows that the sun and the moon shone on the Idol. If, as is evident from the description that the sun and the moon illumined the Deity it must be either that there was no covering over the Idol or that the covering was of a pavilion type. The pavilion or mantapam would have been of stone or wood. There is nothing improbable in this assumption; for we find in the T.T.D.Inscriptions that idols were installed and consecrated in similar mantapams in Tirupati during the 16th century. We also come across such temples of Anjaneya and Ganesa in out of the way places. People go there to fulfil their vows in the full faith that the Murties are varaprasādis (granters of all boons). There is also the consideration that the Alvārs who flourished in the eighth and the ninth centuries A.D. and who sang the glories of Tiruvengadam referred only to the sanctity of the Hill. There is no mention in any of their songs of a temple on it. If there was a temple the author of the Silappadhikaram at any rate would have mentioned it. We find that in his description of Sriranganatha of Srirangam he mentions that He lay recumbent on His Bed in His chamber. The author of the Silappadhikaram and the Alvårs may be said to be contemporaries more or less. It may therefore be reasonably assumed that Tondaiman&rsquo;s temple would have gone into disrepair long before 750 A.D. and that the present building was raised much later, that is at a date when the Pallava style of architecture was well established in the plains. Nor was the temple as it now stands constructed at one and the same time. The sanctum called the garbhagriham along with the ante-chamber called Mukhamantapam
92
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
or Sayanamantapam seems to have been built as one block about the end of the 9th century or early in the 10th century. This was soon followed by the covered pathway for circumambulation and its enclosing walls called the Prathamavaranam or the Mukkoti pradakshinam. Then came in 966 A.D. the structure known as the Tiruvilankōyil. The probable dates for these will be discussed in this chapter on due and full consideration of the available inscriptions.
Then there is a long pause covered by the periods of the reign of the Chola kings, from Rajendra Chola I to Raja Raja II. It was when the weakness of the Chola power gave room for the Yadavarayas and other feudatories to assert a kind of semi-independence that the next stage in the development of the temple commenced. This may be taken to be sometime between 1160 A.D. and 1190 A.D., that is after the life time of Sri Ramanuja. Sri Ramanuja is said to have built the temple of Sri Govindaraja in Tirupati and to have reconsecrated the Idol in 1130 A.D. But it is not the same thing as saying that he built the gopuram and prakara walls in Tirupati. Nor was the gopuram in Tirumala constructed during his life time. The evolution of the temple structures in Tirumala extends even to the 15th and 16th centuries. We find that Säluva Narasimha rayar endowed the village of Durgasamudram in 1482 A.D. for the express purpose of constructing gopurams in Tirumala and Tirupati and for constructing the Narasimharayamantapam. Tallapakkam Tirumala Ayyangar added to the gopuram and constructed the pushkari i steps etc., in the 16th century. There is also the Tirumalaraya Mantapam constructed in the latter part of that century. These are mentioned here to show that there was no blue-print on hand and that the additions were the choice of the donors and were even made without sufficient foresight.
Garbhagriham and &lsquo;Sayanamantapam.
These two form a monolithic structure and were constructed at the same time. There is however no inscription in Tirumala or in Tirupati giving the year of construction. But there are inscriptions, all in the Tamil language and Tamil script-some of which
93
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
are incomplete and some fragmentary, which enable us to fix an approximate date for this structure. One of these inscriptions mentions that a local Bana ruler Vijayaditya made an endowment for three different services, one of these being the burning of one perpetual light or Nandavilakku daily for Tiruvengadathupperumänadigal (the God on the Tiruvengadam Hill). This endowment could be ascribed to 830-850 A.D. and the inscription is on a separate slab now preserved on a platform in the Sri Padmavati Ammavaru Temple in Tiruchchukanur. For only one perpetual light to burn day and night sheltered from the winds on the Hill, Temple in Tirumala would have been a small one. The Garbhagriham and the Sayanamantapam would answer to this description, the Sayanamantapam being the place for the worshipper to stand. The Banaraya referred to above is the person whose birth was commemorated on a slab found in Tirumala&rsquo; in front of the temple. His birth date would have been about the end of the eighth century A.D. After the conquest of the country by the Cholas there are two inscriptions probably of the years 927 and 936 A.D., during the reign of Parantaka I, or Ko-parakesarivarman. One of these tells us that a native of Oranganore in Malainadu-(Kodungōlürān)made an endowment of 40 kalanju of gold with the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur in the 29th year of Ko-parakesari (935-936). The other was probably in the 20th year of his reign and for a like purpose. The inscription is fragmentary. Both the inscriptions are on the west base of the present vahana mantapam in Tiruchchukanur, although the service was to be performed in Tirumala, and the Sabhaiyars of Tiruchchukanur were the trustees for the endowments. The reasonable inference is that although there was a temple in Tirumala the inscription was made in the place where the Sabhaiyars were residing. It might also be that there was difficulty in taking a skilled workman to the Hill. Or it might be due to the fact that the walls of the Tirumala Temple were not such that an inscription could be cut thereon.
There is also another inscription which was made on the north wall of the mukkoti pradakshinam of the temple in Tirumalai on the 7th day of the reign of Rajendra Chola I I.e.
I. I. 3.
94
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
1013 A.D. From this inscription we learn that the Sabhaiyars of Tirumundiyam were the trustees of some endowments, which were for the service of lighting daily 24 oil lamps and one camphor light for Tiruvengada Devar in Tirumala. They failed to perform the service in full. The king&rsquo;s Adhikari during his audit of the acccounts detected this and made due enquiries of the Devakarmis (religious service men) of the Tirumala Temple, recovered from the Subhaiyar 23 pon which was all that could be recovered. The amount was credited to the Treasury, or Sri Bhandaram, of the Temple and the secular managers a d the religious officers were ordered to look to the proper performance of the lighting. The lighting of twenty-four oil lamps could only mean that these were located outside the garbhagriham and would naturally have been arranged in the corridor of the pradakshinam. In the garbhagriham the akhandam would have been fed with ghee and not oil. Tie order of the Adhikari was to the effect that oil should be transported daily to Tirumala along with the other provisions for the Temple. An endowment trust would run into non-performance only after a fairly long period when in all probability the donors or their relations were no more. We may therefore reasonably assume that these endowments would have been made 50 or 60 years before 1013 A.D. The date of those endowments might have been of 950 A.D. And on that date the Temple consisted of the Garbhagriham and Sayanamantapam and also the Mukkoti-pradakshanam as a covered and enclosed space.
The Tiruvilankoyil and the consecration of the silver Idol called by the donor Manavalapperumal (Bhoga Srinivasa).
The Tiruvilankoyil is the structure now known as Stapana mantapam which is a corruption for Snapana mantapam. It was in this mantapam that the donor Samavai got consecrated the silver replica of the Mula Beram whom she presented and for</li>
</ol>

<li>The inscription was already referred to.
&quot;
95HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
whom she made endowments. The inscriptions relating to this endowment are marked numbers 8 and 9 in Volume-I of the T.T.D. Inscriptions. These two inscriptions are of the highest value to us, for they mark the commencement of the popularity of the Tirumala Temple. They are both on the North wall of the first prākāram and are dated the 14th year of Koppatramahendrapanmar. This Koppatramahendrapanmar is identified as KoParthivendra varman who was the son of the Emperor Sundara Chola or Parantaka II. The son is said to have been made the Viceroy of this part of the country, known as Tondaimandalam Sundara Chola&rsquo;s reign covered the period of 953-970 A.D. KoParthivendra on the death of his father became the Emperor in 970 A.D. under the surname Aditya II, Karikala. These details enable us to fix the year of the inscriptions.
The year of the inscriptions Nos. 8 and 9 Volume-I, the date of the First Purattasi Tirunal and the date of consecration of Manavalapperumal.
The earliest year for the appointment of Ko-Parthivendra as Viceroy of Tondaimandalam would have been 953 A D. soon after Sundara Chola became the Emperor. The fourteenth year therefrom which is the date of the inscriptions will therefore be 966 A.D. Some may argue that the fourteenth year should count from the date of Ko-Parthivendra&rsquo;s accession to the throne as Emperor. But as the period of his reign did not extend to 14 years after his accession this view would be unacceptable. Further if the 14th year referred to the year after he became Emperor, the name used should have been Aditya Karikala with all the prasasti which is usual to employ while referring to the Emperor. The year 966 A.D. is therefore the date of our inscriptions. This is borne out by the internal evidence contained in inscription No. 8. It is given therein that for commencing the Brahmotsavam</li>
<li>The Tamil expression used does not indicate the idea &ldquo;in the reign of&rdquo;
96
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
the Tirumulaiattal (or seed sowing-usually referred to as Anku rarpanam) should take place in Chitra (chitta nakshatram) and that there should be possessions and festivals on the succeeding nine days ending with the Tirthavari festival. The tenth day from Chitra would not always be Tiruvonam (Sravanam) on which day the Tirthavari should take place since Sravanam is the ninth nakshatram from chitta. It has been an unalterable custom that the Tirthavari, which is always on the tenth day, counted from Ankurarpanam, should be when Sravana nakshatram is current. So in very many years the Ankurarpanam would be in Hasthanakshatra to make sure that the Tirthavari is in Sravana. It happens that in 966 A.D. Chitta nakshatram was current for Ankurarpanam. In 967 and in 968 it was not so. In fact the only nearest year after 966 to satisfy the conditions was 983 A.D. in which year Ko-Parthivendra was not alive even in his capacity as Emperor. In 966 A.D. on Tuesday 27th of the Tamil month Avani (August, 21) Chitta nakshatram commenced at 6 ghatikas after sunrise, so that it was current during the night when AnkuFarpanam would have taken place. On Thursday the 5th of Purattasi, which is ten days counted from Tuesday 27th August, Sravana Nakshatra was current till 8 ghatikas 24 vighatikas after sunrise, within which time Tirthavari would have taken place. This period from Tuesday of one week to Thursday of the succeeding week gives ten days. After the Ankurarpan day there would therefore have been festivals for nine days. The year 966 A.D. was Akshaya according to the southern cycle. The Tirthavari of the first Purattasi Tirunal instituted by Samavai was thus in Akshaya year (966 A.D.) Thursday the 5th of Purattasi (30th August).
The date of consecration of Manavālapperumal will next be fixed. There is nothing in either of the inscriptions to help us in this. But there are other considerations which do definitely help us. The installation and consecration of the Idol and the Purattasi festival for it are mentioned in the same inscription. The reasonable inference is that the festival would have taken place in the same year as the consecration of the Idol; also that the consecration would have been on the earliest possible day preceding the festival consistent with the astrological dictums

97
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
guiding the selection of an auspicious day. It should be during a uttarayanam month, i.e., one of the Tamil months covered by the northerly course of the sun. This would point to the month Ani as the suitable one. Without going into the details of astrological considerations it may be stated that Friday, Bahula Tritiya, the 16th of Ani of Akshaya year, Sravana nakshatram, was the day of consecration of Manavalapperumal (or Bhoga Srinivasa.) The nakshatram Sravanam is known as the Avatara nakshatra of Sri Venkatesa as also of Sri Varahaswami. The inscription tells us that Karmarchana was performed for Tiruvengadattu perumanadigal first and Abhishekam was performed next for the Manavalapperumal (who was adorned with all the jewellery (or Tiruvabharanam) mentioned therein, before the ceremony of consecration took place. On that Friday Sravana nakshatram commenced at 8 ghatikas after sunrise. The first 10 ghatikas of Sravanam being inauspicious the consecration would have taken place after 18 ghatikas from sunrise had expired. The Karmarchan of the Dhruva Beram or Periya Perumal would have taken that much time since an ordinary Abhishekam would have been performed for the Dhruva Murti also. On the previous night (Thursday night) there would have been flower decoration, now known as Poolangi seva. Friday June 8, 966 A.D. would have been the day of consecration of Manavalapperumal. This day in the month of Ani was considered the most auspicious and the Nayanonmilanam (opening the eyes of the new silver idol) would have been done on the previous day which was also an auspicious day.
The Place of Consecration, The Tiruvilankoyil.
The Abhishekam and consecration of Manavalapperumal took place in a mantapam which was called &ldquo;Tiruvilankoyil &quot; which term means Junior temple. A separate place for the Abhishekam is a necessity as an Idol which had not been duly consecrated could not find a place in the Garbhagriham. A mantapam was perhaps newly constructed, even if it was not already there, as near to the Garbhagriham as possible so that at the moment of consecration the new Idol may without loss of time be placed in front of the Dhruva Beram and the connecting link for the flow
98
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
of the Divine Power be established. We must remember, that there was no invoking of Divine Power treating Manavälapperumal as an independent Murti. This mantapam or Tiruvilankoyil was constructed so as to be in front of the then existing temple which consisted of the Garbhagriham and Sayanamantapam and the Pradakshinam. The silver Idol (Manavalapperumal) was spiritually united with the Dhruva Beram by a connecting gold link and silk cord which were introduced at the proper moment. This gold link and cord continue to exist and are long enough to allow the silver Beram being shifted from near the Dhruva Beram to the outer most eastern edge of the Tiruvilankoyil, where now is situated the Bangāruvakili which is the first and imposing entrance into the sanctum. How and when the Bangaru vakili and the wall containing it were constructed will be discussed later. After the consecration ritual was completed the silver Murti would have found His place in the Garbhagriham just in front of Tiruvengadamudaiyan at the spot where we find Him now. He is the Kautuka Beram for the Dhruva Murti and therefore made to be an exact representation of the original.
It is worth restating that the Dhruva Murti played no part in the consecration ritual except when the linking took place. The usual daily puja, called Karmachana in the inscription, was performed to Him. It was after completing this Karmarchana, that the installation of the silver Image in the mantapam, the Abhishekam and consecration in the mantapam, took place. It may be mentioned here that the Marichi Samhita calls the daily puja as Karmarchana (worship as prescribed).
The necessity for the Installation of Manavalapperumal.
The necessity for an Idol of a smaller size than the Dhruva Beram would be apparent to all those who have faith in the Archa form of worship as ordained in the Agamas. Six asanas1 are prescribed therein and the worshipper performs the worship pertaining to each of these. In the case of the Dhruva Murti paryanka</li>
<li>Asanas are the postures in which the murti is supposed to be for facilitating worship such as bathing, dressing, eating and sleeping
99
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
åsana (putting into bed) is an impossibility. Abhishekam (bathing) is inpracticable every day owing to the difficulty of getting a large quantity of water and the greater difficulty of removing the water from the floor of the Garbhagriham. In regard to food offering also there is a difficulty. It is to obviate these difficulties that a smaller Idol was found necessary. All the upacharams, or services rendered to this Idol are in effect rendered to the Dhruva Murti. When large quantities of food (called Tiruppavadai) are deposited in the front mantapam the silver Beram is brought near to the Bangaru Vakili so as to remain within the consecrated limits and the archaka offers the food to this Deity. All the doors being kept open the food will be in the view of the Main Deity as well.
Ornaments or Tiruvabharanam of Manavalapperumal.
At the time of consecration the Silver Murti was decorated with certain ornaments known collectively as Tiruvabharanam. In Idol worship the idea of associating with the Murti certain weapons and ornaments is an ancient one and the jewellery mentioned in the inscription is according to those ideas. These ornaments are here mentioned in extenso to give an idea of the culture and civilisation of those days. These are:-
(1) Tirumudi (crown or Kireetam) which is set with 23 diamonds, 16 big pearls, two large centre rubies or (Tadavikkaṭṭina māņikkam). (4).
(2) Ear ornaments consisting of gold makaram and coral koppu for each ear. (பொன்னின் மகரம், பவழத்தின் கொப்பு)
(3) Necklace or garland of four strands of gold set with 14 diamonds, 3 rubies: 11 large pearls and several small red pearls.
(4) One gold body belt or Udara Bandhanam.
(5) One gold waist girdle (Tiruvaraippattigai) set with four
rubies.
(6) Gold bracelet round each of the upper arms set with
two cut rubies (called Bahu Valayam).
100
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
(7) Gold bracelets four, each set with two rubies.
(8) Necklets or valaiyal of gold, four.
(9) Anklets or Karai of gold, two.
(10) Silver Prabha set with one big ruby (Nāyāka mānikkam)
The total weight of gold in all the ornaments was 47 kalanju These ornaments are only copies of those sculptured on the body of the Dhruva Murti.
Whether Manavälapperumal has now all these ornaments on His Divine Person or Tirumēni is a mootpoint. Having been consecrated along with the Murti it is presumed that He has not been divested of them.
Endowments Corpus and the Services.
The services for which the endowments shown in the two inscriptions were made, have already been mentioned. What the endowments were will now be described in some detail. These two being the first endowments that we know of deserve special mention. They are in the shape of lands purchased from a number of parties aggregating to 7176-3/4 kulis. Inscription No. 8 Vol. I accounts for 3000 kulies and No. 9 for 4176-3/4 kulies. A kuli is one square rod, the rod being a pole measuring 16 spans length. If we assume that a span is equivalent to 9 inches, the endowments would be about 24 acres in extent.
From the details given of the lands we learn that there was a highway going northward and passing through Tiruchchukanur; that lands belonging to the Tiruchchukanur Tiruvilankoyil temple were purchased indicating thereby that that temple had begun to be liquidated; that there was a tank called Perumbāna tank leading to the inference that the country was under the Bāna rule and that there was also a tank called Panchavan Mădevi eri in the name of one of the Chola queens leading to the inference that when the inscriptions were made the Chola rule had become effective.
The Pallavas and the Cholas seem to have paid great attention to the improvement of irrigation sources in the country. The
101
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
name Salaiperumal-Tirumala shows that the Tirumantra Salai in Tiruchchukanur was becoming a popular proselytising institution.
We also learn from a comparison of the closing words in inscriptions Nos. 4, 12 and 8 (Volume I) that the worshippers of Vishnu down to the year 936 A.D. styled themselves as Emperummånadiyar. Thereafter they came to be called Sri Vaishnavas. Sri Vaishnava Raksha became the subscription in all later inscriptions. The significance and implications of this change would be apparent to all.1

<li>Before the days of Sri Alavandar Vaishnavas did not form an organised community but on&rsquo;y individuals who had faith in Emperuman (Vishnu) as the Supreme Dcity. Sri Devi was not considered as being co-equal to Vishnu. It was Sri Alavandar who first made it an essential article of faith that Sri and Vishnu should be worshisped together and as forming one entity. Vishnu worshippers who did not subscribe to this doctrine such as Dvaitins are only Vaishnavas and not Sri Vaishnavas
102
TIRUVENGADAM TEMPLE
There is however a secret which is known only to a very few worshippers but not mentioned in the inscription. There is a Yantram on the Pitham of Bhoga Srinivasa and a corresponding one under the Bēram. It has a definite significance according to the Vaikhanasa as well as the Pancharatra agama more so in the latter. This will be considered in another Chapter.
Tirukkodi Tirunal (festival)
We also learn from these two inscriptions that a Tirukkoḍitirunal need not necessarily be a ten days&rsquo; festival. The festival ending with the Tirudvadasi day was only a seven days&rsquo; festival. There were processions by day as well as by night during these days. The Vaikhanasa agama provides for festivals of five, seven and nine days. It is very unlikely that the Silver Idol inseparably connected with the Dhruva Beram would have been the processional Deity. We find a processional Beram in the Garbhagriham known as Venkatatturaivar or Ugra Srinivasa which is reported to be an ancient Idol. This Idol would have been the processional Murti in those days. This will be considered at length in the next chapter
Alterations and additions made to the temple structure, the installation of a few more shrines, the other Murtis installed in the &lsquo;garbhagriham&rsquo; and the Varahaswami Temple in Tirumala as an independent temple will be mentioned in the next chapter. Mantapams and Nandavanams which multiplied themselves in large numbers will be dealt with as an Appendix. The real history of the Tiruvengadam Temple commences with the installation of Manavalapperumal in 966 A.D. Every inscription on the walls of the &lsquo;mukkoti pradakshinam&rsquo; is of a later, date. Soon after the consecration of the Silver Idol, gifts and endowments were made and inscribed on the temple walls. Although the Chōla kings made no gifts or endowments their queens seem to have made some, as is observed from some of the fragmentary and incomplete inscriptions. In the sixteenth year of the reign of Vira Rajendra Panmar (Raja Raja-I) or in 1000 A.D., Parantaka Devi amman, the widowed queen of Sundara Chola was the first to present a gold pattam weighing 52 kalanju and set with six rubies,
103
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
4 diamonds and 28 pearls. About the same time Ulagamadevi, the queen of Raja Raja-I, appears to have made an endowment of 29 kalanju of gold for burning one perpetual light or Nanda Vilakku. As the inscription is fragmentary the exact date cannot be fixed, but must be between the years 985 and 1013 A.D. It was already noticed that it was on the seventh day ofthe reign of Rajenda Chola-I (son of Raja Raja-I) i.e,, 1013 A.D. that the king&rsquo;s Adhikari enquired into the non-performance of lamp lighting by the Sabhaiyar of Tirumundiyan and arranged for the future observance of the trust. This inscription is of special interest as it disproves the futile contention of some people who argue that Tiruvengaḍa muḍaiyan was the name of the deity in Tiruchchukanur, which place they presume was called Tiruvengadam and that there was no such deity in Tirumala till about 1245 A.D. This inscription is clear on the point that Tiruvengada Devar was on the Tirumala Hill, that endowments for lamp lighting in that temple were made long anterior to 1013 A,D. and that oil for the purpose was ordered to be transported daily to Tirumala. One Arulakki alias Raja Raja Muvendavelan, probably a Chola officer, made two endowments in the reign of Raja Raja-I, one of 40 kalanju of gold for lighting one perpetual lamp and the other a grant of some land or village in Avūrkkuṛṛam on the south bank of (possibly the Kaveri) in Sōlanāḍu. These are inscribed on separate slabs in Tiruchchukanur and may have been intended for the Deity in that place. But the endowments are here mentioned to show that even during the Chola period their officers, made endowments for Vishnu Temples. Apart from the one inscription of 1013 A.D. which shows the method adopted by the Cholas for dispensing justice there is no inscription to show that either Rajendra or any of his men made endowments to this temple. Nor do we find any endowments during the reign of any of his successors till we reach the reign of Vira Rajendra Chola-II or Kulothunga-I. Kulothunga made no endowment. But his queen (Avanimuludaiyal) made some arrangement for the supply of milk and curds. The inscription is fragmentary and was found on a slab paved into the floor of the west side of the first prakara. It must have found its way there</li>

when the flooring was laid after the renovation of the garbhagriham and vimanam in 1250 A.D. The reference to Tiruvengadamudaiyan is in endearing terms our Tiruväyppäḍi Tirumala Ālvār&rsquo; (எங்களுடை திருவாய்ப்பாடு. திருமலை இழ்வர்க்கு பாலமுதும் தயிரமுதும்). These words are very suggestive of the tradition which states that cows emptied their udders into the mound wherein the Deity was first discovered. There are four more fragmentary inscriptions of this period. Two are on the Mukkotipradakshinam walls; the one on the south wall seems to indicate that a dēvādānam village Tirukkō was granted to the Sri Bhandaram; the other on the north wall of the third prakaram refers to an endowment for food offering on some days by one Kasyapan in the middle of the festival days. How this fragment went into the third prakaram we cannot now explain.. The other two are separate slabs, one being some Gure by a TirunaKaivilli and the other probably an endowment of land in Sola vala nadu. These fragmentary inscriptions are being dealt with in detail to show that the temple was becoming popular after the installation of Manavālapperumal and that the Chola kings resorted to no persecution against Vaishnavism. Some may be under the erroneous impression that because Sri Ramanuja feared persecution at the hands of Kulottunga-I and therefore took refuge in the Hoysala country till the death of Kulottunga, there may have been a general persecution of Sri Vaishnavas. Some of these inscriptions of the Chola period give the full &lsquo;prasasti of the kings which will be shown separately.

PART (1)
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE AND ITS ENVIRONS.
IN the previous chapter the installation and consecration
of the silver Murti &ldquo;Maṇavālapperumal,&rdquo; now known as Bhōga Srinivasa, was described. It was presumed that at that time the temple consisted of the Sanctum Sanctorum (Garbha-griham) and an ante-room (Mukha mantapam) together with an Antarmandalam or Pradakshinam or circumambulating corridor surrounding the former. There was also a mantapam (Ardha mantapam in front of the Pradakshinam called Tiruvilam Koyil (now called Sthapana-mantapam). The present temple, however, is very much. larger and is composed of a number of structures, gopurams (towers) and prākārams (compound walls) which will be described in this chapter. Before doing so a topographical description of the temple and its environs will be given.
Topography: -Whether the pilgrim ascends on foot by the old pathway or travels by the new motor road he will arrive at the top of the hill at about the same spot near to the temple. He will there find the Fnquiry office of the Devasthanam and the Devas&rdquo; thanam Dispensary facing him. There is also the old unfinished or mondi gopuram which was recently renovated and furnished with a roof and a kind of turret much unlike the others of the old style. This gopuram faces the south. A short paved roadway towards the north leads to another small gopuram and portal of older construction. It is after crossing this gateway that the street known as the Sannidhi street runs east to west straight to the main gateway and gopuram of the temple known as Mukhadvaram or the Periya Tiruvasal, and now called &lsquo;Padikavali Gopuram.&rsquo; At the eastern end of this street stands the shrine of Anjaneya or Hanuman, facing the temple. To the left is the old thousand pillared mantapam. That part of it which abuts

the street has in recent times been converted into living tenements and a portion for the police station. To the north of the road lies the Periya Jiyar matham, a market stall and a few shops. At the western end and right in front of the gopuram is a small but tall four pillared mantapam which was much used during festivals in olden times. From this manapam there is a flight of steps to the full width of the street,descending to meet the East Mada Street running north to south in front of the main gateway of the temple.
Pilgrims usually secure lodgings in one or the other of the pilgrims&rsquo; quarters belonging to the Devasthanam or may have to be under obligation to Pandas who not only provide lodgings but act as guides and cater to all the requirements and conveniences of their wards.
As the main object of the pilgrim is to worship in the temple the usual formalities observed before entering the temple will now be described. He goes or is taken to the small pond which is provided with cut-stone steps and has a mantapam at its centre called Neerāļi mantapam. This pond is situated to his right as he faces the temple and close to the north prākāram wall of the temple. A number of shops on its banks however hide its view. This pond is called the &ldquo;Swami Pushkarini &quot; or Tirukōnēri and is considered so holy that all the thirty-three crores of sacred waters in creation are said somehow to find their way into it on the sacred day known as Mukkōļi Dvādasi.&rsquo; Here a purohit who claims hereditary privilege, helps the pilgrim to a purificatory bath in the traditionally accepted manner after reciting the Sankalpa mantrams. The pilgrim is then made to circumambulate the four main streets surrounding the temple and the Pushkarini which form the Mahapradakshinam.&rsquo; On the north-western shore of the Pushkarini and almost near the middle of the north mada street stands the temple of Sri Varaha swamy, also known as Varaha Nainar and Gnanappiran,(the boar avatar of Sri Vishnu). The pilgrim is expected to worship this God first so that spiritual knowledge or</p>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Gianam may dawn on him and make him fit to worship Sri Venkateswara. The north and south maḍa streets of the Mahapradakshinam measure about 800 feet each in length and the west maḍa street is about 900 feet. But the cast maḍa street running in front of the main temple and alongside the east bank of the Pushkarini measures about 750 feet. The ground slopes from west to east. The entire area bounded by these streets is very much lower in level than the outlying country. It may roughly be taken that the maḍa streets are about 15 feet lower in level than the outlying ground whereon houses have sprung up. The ground beyond this rises rapidly on all sides. The space enclosed by the maḍa streets would originally have been uneven ground and considerable amount of excavation and levelling should have been done to bring it to its present shape. The area of this plot is roughly 16 acres and comprises the Temple proper, the Swami Pushkarani, the Varahaswamy temple and a site called the Pāta Pushkarini where a tank was constructed by Achyutaraya Maharaya in the 16th century and subsequently filled up by the Mahants in the 19th century. There are also behind the Temple and the Swami Pushkarini a number of lanes and houses which at one time were cultivated gardens (Nandavanams) maintained to supply daily fruits and flowers for the use of the Deity. The vast amount of excavation and levelling done should naturally have made the temple authorities realise that the Deity stood on very low ground. So they seem to have changed His name from Uchchiyilninrän (he who stood on the summit) to &lsquo;Malai kuniya ninran&rsquo; (he who stood where the hill bowed). Out of the total area of 16 acres the present temple covers 2.20 acres, the Swami Pushkarini 1.50 acres and the Pāta Pushkarini 2.50 acres (the Pāta Pushkarini is now a flower garden with some houses). The remaining 10 acres are covered by a number of lanes, houses and some matams, although originally they were all flourishing Nandavanams supplying flowers and fruits to the temple. The present Ahobila matam in the south mada street (facing south) was one such flower garden or Nandavanam in the early years of the 14th century A.D. with a matam located in the garden. The matam then bore the name &ldquo;Van Sathakōpan Tirunandavanam.&rdquo; There was also the Sitakaraganāam Matam. Some fragmentary and incomplete inscriptions of the pre-Yadavaraya period mention some matams whose names are however lost.
108
TIRUMALA TEMPLE AND ITS ENVIRONS
The old land-marks on the boundary of this area are (1) The Tirumala Nambi Tirumāļgai (the house in which Tirumala Nambi lived in the last quarter of the 10th century A.D.) It was the first building, (a stone mantapam with mud walls all round) in the south maḍa street facing the north. It is near this place that the processional deity makes the first halt during festival processions and the recital of Vedas and the Tamil Prabhandam commence formally with the blessings of the deity. The Ahobila matam (or Van Sathakōpan matam) is also in this street some distance further west facing the south. There are also the old residences of some of the other Acharyapurushas (2) At the end of the south māda street and nearly where it meets the west mãḍa street stood the garden &lsquo;Tirumalikai&rsquo; (or garden house) where Sri Ananthaļvār, the famous disciple of Sri Ramanuja, lived in the last quarter of the 11th century A.D. The garden and the tank stand outside the temple area. At the south west corner the path way from Chandragiri joins this māḍa street. There is a mantapam at the junction. (3) In the west maḍa street are a number of choultries facing the east, the well-known ones being those which belong to the Maharaja of Mysore and the Raja of Pithapuram (the latter is now owned by the Devasthanam). There are also other matams of recent origin. Some of the Acharyapurushas and the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur owned houses in this strect. After 1843 A.D. the Mahants of the Hattiramji Mutt who were also the Vicharanakartas of the temple extended their possessions. It is worth remembering that as in the south mada street so also in all the other streets the houses were originally stone mantapams which were subsequently converted into houses by raising mud walls between the pillars. They might have been built by the temple authorities and given as free quarters. (4) The Pāta Pushkarini and the Swami Pushkarini together abut a large part of the north mãḍa street. The archakas (nambimars) have their houses on either side of this street. Sri Varahaswami temple is on the shore of the Swami Pushkarini and at its north-west corner adjacent to the archakahouses, a house site (facing south) which was confiscated from an erring archaka was gifted away by Sri Krishnadevaraya Maharaya to Sriman Vyasa Tirtha Sripada Udaiyar for constructing a Madhwa Matam in 1524 A.D. The forebears of our Ex-Governor

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
General, Sri C. Rajagopalachari had their home in this street next cast to this matam. This street has a steep gradient from west to east and the dragging of the big four faced wooden car during the Brahmotsavam has to be managed by dexterous application of breaks and steering. At the north east corner is the Kalther mantapam (GU) where during the Vijayanagar days swing festivals used to be celebrated. At the north west corner the hill-path from Bhakarapet to the temple joins this street, and at the north east corner the one from Mamandur and Piliutla joins. The pathway to the Akasa Ganga and the Papavinasam waterfalls also take off at the latter corner. (5) The cast maḍa street has the Swami Pushkarini and the temple to its west, while there are some houses of acharyapurushas, and others and also the Brahmatantraswami matam (Parakalaswami mutt) on the east side. The large four faced wooden car and the car-stand mantapam, the Divanam building of the Devasthanams and the Vahana mantapam are also on this side. At the southern end can be seen the west face of the thousand pillared mantapam. The most disquieting and disfiguring feature of the east maḍa street is the existence of a large number of coffee hotels and shops along the shores of the Pushkarini which pollute the tank. There are also numerous shops in temporary sheds of inflamable material abutting the temple wall and the base of the thousand pillared mantapam. These have considerably narrowed the already narrow width of this street. In case of a fire accident all the inscriptions on the temple wall will be lost. The starting of the car procession in this narrow space is a difficult affair. Even the mantapams which were constructed by Saluva Narasimha and other great devotees on the shores of the Pushkarini for use during the floating festival have become shops and coffee hotels.
The Thousand Pillared mandapam.
The thousand pillared mantapam is rectangular in shape and is bounded on the west by the east māda street, on the north by the sannidhi street, on the east by the street or pathway from the newly renovated gopuram to the small gopuram at the eastern end of the sannidhi street and on the south by the street in front

TIRUMALA TEMPLE AND ITS ENVIRONS
of the Sri Hattiramji matam. The Hathiramji matam stands on high ground and is on a level with the top of the terrace of the thousand pillared mantapam. There is a row of corrugated iron sheds for housing pilgrims constructed on this terrace and facing the Hattiramji mutt. The ground floor of the mantapam stands half submerged by the street on its east side. This mantapam was constructed from out of the annual income of the village of Durgasamudram which Saluva Narasimha endowed in 1472 A. D. for the specific purpose of building gopurams, mantapams and prākāram walls of the temple. It does not now serve the purposes for which it was originally constructed. Its renovation and use for festivals would commemorate the name of that great benefactor.
Sri Hattiramji Mutt:-This is still an important matam in Tirumala although its secular connection with the temple, and therefore its influence, nominally came to an end from 1933 when the Committee system of management replaced the Vicharanakarta Mahant. The Mahant however continued to be a hereditary member of the Committee and wielded much power. The administration of the temple by the Mahant Vicharanakartas from 1843 A.D. onwards was marked by a series of litigation which characterised it as one of embezzlement, misappropriation and diversion of temple funds.
The Committee which replaced the Mahant in 1933 had not the legal powers to prevent the diversion of temple income. &lsquo;Dalalies&rsquo; still ply their old trade with impunity and even openly. The rival temple within the matam still continues to receive votaries. It is believed that the unwary and simple-minded pilgrim is seduced by the Dalali into the Mațam and is made to feel convinced that it would be more pleasing to Sri Venkateswara if the intended votive offerings are given away in part or in full to the Matam. There seems to be no provision in the new H. R. E. Act of 1951 to effectively check diversion of temple income.
In the old days a pilgrimage to Tirumala was not without its risks and discomforts. Rulers and men having wealth and influence would bring with them a retinue of followers for purposes

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of safety. During the years when the Muslim Emperor of Delhi and the Nabob subordinate to him, the French and the English were fighting for political supremacy conditions seem to have been far worse than during the Vijayanagar rule. Reference was already made in Chapter I as to how the British were employing the caste Hindu sepoys to safeguard the routes during the Brahmotsavam period. But neither the British nor the Muslims ever set foot on the Hill out of respect to the sentiments of the caste Hindus. After the management of the temple passed into the hands of the Mahants in 1843 A.D. circumstances made it necessary to violate the old traditions. Increase in the commission of grave crimes even within the Mahant&rsquo;s Matam on the hill and the non-co-operative attitude of the Mahants to facilitate detection compelled the Government to establish in 1872 a police station on the hill and a police force to maintain law and order. European district officers of the magistracy, the police and the excise departments were permitted to ascend the hill, for exercising supervision and control; but not other officers. The exemption was, however, extended to others also at the discretion of the Mahant.
A very commodious and well-furnished Travellers&rsquo; Bungalow was constructed in recent times for the halt of a European Governor of the Province. This bungalow has since been improved by the Devasthanam Committee. A hill which according to tradition burns away all sins, became a rendezvous for criminals committing grave crimes and European officer had to be welcomed on the Hill. The Travellers&rsquo; Bungalow is in a lovely spot overlooking the pathway to Chandragiri and on the shores of the Ananthāļvār tank which supplies drinking water to the pilgrims.

PART (2)
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE:-Gopurams, Prakarams,
Pradakshinams and the Structures thereon.
THE Sanctum is surrounded on all sides by three compound walls known as Präkārams or Avaranams. The space enclosed between these walls increases in width, the narrowest being between the Garbhagraham wall and the first prakaram and the widest being that between the outer and the middle prākārams. As is usual there is only one entrance for each prākāram which is on the east side and gopurams have been constructed over the two outer entrances. The space enclosed between each set of prākāram is called a pradakshinam or antarmandalam or circumambulating space. The pradakshinam surrounding the Garbhagriham has, however, remained closed for the public, except for one day in the year, for about seven centuries past.
After circumambulating the maha-pradakshinam, the pilgrim arrives at the main gateway of the temple or Periya Gopura Vāsal or Padikavali. At a distance of about 120 feet from this gateway is the inner Gopuram with its gateway. From these gopurams take off on either side high compound walls about 4 feet in thickness which completely enclose the ground covered by the temple.
The outer Gopuram.
The outer Gopuram stands on a quadrangular base, 38 feet south to north, and 32 feet east to west. The gateway or opening called Mukha Dvāram or Tiruvāsal is in the middle and about 11 feet wide. There are two cutstone door frames symmetrically placed from either end. The door jambs, the sills and soffits of these are of wide and thick cut stone and carved in the traditional
8
113HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
style. The front doorway alone has folding doors hung on pivots and made of stout lattice wood work, backed with thick battens fastened together by stout iron nails having artistic heads. The doors are closed during nights after temple service, bolted and locked from inside. There is also a trap door on the left side door which is kept open on occasions when the main doors have to be kept closed. Only the privileged few are allowed to get into the temple by this trap door. The compound walls emanating from the outer gopuram measure 414 feet east to west and 263 feet south to north.
No inscription records the date of construction of this Gopuram and the prākāram attached to it. An approximation could however be made. There is an inscription on the right side front face of the door-jamb wall of the Gopuram dated the twelfth regnal year of Tribhuvana Chakravartigal Sri Yadavaraya Viranarasinga Devar which records the gift of 62 cows and two breeding bulls for the daily supply of ghee for lighting two Nandāvilakku. The year would correspond to 1217 A. D. The place where the inscription is found leads us to believe that the outer Gopuram had come into existence before that date. Chronologically the next inscription is on the door-jamb wall (front) in Sanskrit language and Grantha script. That states that Sriman Viranarasimha Deva Nripati having conquered his enemies and having become famous, assumed all the emblems of royalty&ndash;such as elephants, garland, světa chchatram-also that he had himself weighed against gold and that with that gold he made Venkatagiri rival Suragiri (or Mount Meru) in brilliance. This event would have taken place late during his reign and perhaps some time about 1260 A.D. There are many other inscriptions of still later dates on this Gopuram. But the one which deserves notice is fragmentary and is in a niche above the first tier of the Gopuram to the south of the passage. Translated into English it reads, &ldquo;Kshēmāsura who is Ganapati
&hellip;&hellip;..for him who forcibly expelled from the town.&rdquo; These words appear to refer to the exploits of the Emperor Sundara Pandya who reigned from 1251—1275 A.D. The fragment may be assigned to about the year 1260 A.D. It might be surmised from this that the outer Gopuram, although constructed before 1217
114
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
A.D. had only a bald terrace until about 1260 A.D. when the first tier of the gopuram appears to have been raised. The construction of a bald Gopuram (without the tiers) might have been the work of one of the earlier Yadavarayas, perhaps Ghatţi Dēva or Rajamalla or even Sri Viranarasinga. It may be stated here that all the inscriptions relating to Jatavarman Sundara Pandya (the overlord of the country from 1251 A.D.) are on the right and left base of the inner Gopuram, including No. I-45 of the year 1264 A.D. and No. 1-51 which refers to his crowning himself in Kanchi. The presence of a fragment in a niche in the first tier of the outer gopuram leads to the inference that the tiers of the outer Gopuram were constructed at a very late period when some of the Pandyan inscriptions had even gone to pieces. We know that Saluva Narasinga Deva endowed the village of Durgasamudram for the purpose of constructing and repairing gopurams etc., about the year 1472-1482 A.D. The tiers might have been constructed during that period. The construction of the präkāram walls might have commenced soon after the completion of the Gopuram (without the tiers). At any rate, at the time when Sri Ranganathaswamy of Srirangam was brought to Tirumala about 1320 or 1330 A.D. the outer prākāram walls were in existence, since the shrine for Sri Ranganatha abuts the south prākāram wall, Inscriptions however were not made on these walls until the end of the 15th century or the beginning of the 16th century. The most conspicuous is the one on the east wall, outer side, south of the Gopuram inscribed by the personal engraver of Sri Krishna Deva Maharaya. It is in Sanskrit poetry and prose and Telugu script. In it the geneology of the Emperor is traced from the Moon. The geneology is only a preamble to an endowment made by him in the year 1513 A. D.1 of three villages from the income of which a Brahmotsavam was to be celebrated annually for Tiruvengalanatha Deva for the merit of his father Narasanayaka Uḍayāru and his mother Nägarājam mangāru. A Kanarese version of the same in Nandinagari script is on the south wall of the second prākāram. It is thus seen that the third or outer prākāram wall came into use for inscriptions long after the second one had been largely used.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
THE SAMPANGI PRADAKSHINAM.
(Or the third Avaranam.)
Leaving the outer Gopuram passage behind, the pilgrim enters a mantapam 36 ft. x 36 feet standing on sixteen pillars and adjoining the Gopuram. In front of this and at a distance of about 50 feet therefrom is a similar mantapam situated in front of the inner Gopuram. This will be described later. These two mantapams, with the open space in between practically cover the width of the front or eastern portion of the Sampangi Pradakshinam,. which is the name given to the quandrangular space between the outer prākāram and the next inner one. Although the frontage or open space here is about 120 feet in width, on the other three sides it is hardly 50 feet. The structures and objects found in this portion will now be mentioned.
Krishnarayar Mantapam:-This one adjoins the outer Gopuram above mentioned. This name is given to it for want of a better one. The objects which come to view therein are a number of statues, placed on either side of the passage with their back to the west wall of the gopuram. It is worth noting that all the statues of the emperors are bare-bodied except for the under-wear or loin cloth. This is in conformity with the rules enjoined by the Agamas and the Puranas when going to worship the Deity in a temple. There are thirty two rules for observance and these will be given later. On the north side are three statues in bronze which represent Sri Vira Krishnadeva Maharaya with two of his queens, Tirumala Devi on the left and Chinna Devi on the right. The emperor wears the crown which is said to be of his own design. On the south side are three more, the first one being the copper statue of King Venkatapatiraya. The next two are of stone representing an Emperor and his queen. The Devasthanam epigraphist has stated that they represent probably Tirumalaraya and his queen Vengalamba. This, however, does not appear to be a correct surmise as none of our inscriptions couples with his name the Emperor&rsquo;s titles. They are more likely to represent Achyutaraya Makaraya and his queen Varadajiamman. There is a clear cut Vadagalai caste mark on the fore-head of the Emperor, just below
116
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
the crown. It is an undisputed fact that Achyuta Raya was a staunch sectarian Sri Vaishnava. Soon after his liberation from the Chandragiri fortress, he was given a sacred bath in the Tirumala Temple with the consecrated water poured from the conch used for the daily Tirumanjanam of Bhoga Srinivasa. The coronation then took place in the temple itself for the first time. This conch (Sankham) would have been handled for this purpose only by an Acharyapurusha since an archaka would not have been accepted by that emperor as a religious preceptor. Kumāratatayyangar, son of Ettür Sottai Tirumalanambi Tholappar Iyengar, who was a prominent Vadagalai Acharyapurusha would naturally have done the abhishekam and crowning ceremony. It. has to be borne in mind here that Achyutaraya personally performed the Srinivasa Sahasranamarchana while the archaka had to content himself with reciting the 1,008 names. This shows how conceited he was as a Sri Vaishnava devotee. The statue shows that he was a Vadagalai. It is also seen from an inscription of his endowment for the celebration of a Lakshmidevi festival in Tirumala that he preferred to be styled therein as Swami Achyutaraya Maharaya (not Sri Vira Achyutaraya Maharaya) and his wife as Swami Varadāji Amman. Swami is generally the eponym prefixed to the name of a Srivaishnava held in veneration. For the above reasons, we may state confidently that these two statues represent Achyutaraya and his queen Varadajiamman. By way of contrast, it may be noted that there is no caste mark on the forehead of Krishnadevaraya and Venkatapatiraya. Venkatapatiraya has a long garland of beads (lotus or tulasi) round his neck; so also Achyutaraya. Although Achyuta and Krishna wear the kanthi (neck ornament) the kanthi of the latter has something like a rudraksham in the middle. There are three other statues stationed near the Dhvajastambha mantapam and facing north. They are those of Khemaran (Todara Mall) and his family Mata Mohanade and Pita B b..
Ranga Mantapam.
Abutting the east and south walls of the outer prākāram and to the south of the Krishnaraya mantapam is the Ranga Mantapam standing on high basement and measuring about sixty feet
117
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
east to west and 108 feet north to south. At nearly its southern end is a small shrine about 12 feet square which has long been kept closed. The shrine appears to have been the abode of Sri Ranganatha of Srirangam during His stay in Tirumala in the years 1320-1360 A.D. After the idol was conveyed back to Srirangam the shrine seems to have been closed. In front of it is the big Seshavahanam screening the above shrine. A portion of the mantapam on the eastern side as well as the western side has been converted into store rooms. This Ranga Mantapam might have been constructed by Sriranganatha Yadavaraya, the local ruler, to accommodate Sri Ranganatha of Srirangam when the idol was removed from Srirangam owing to the fear of molestation by the Muslim hordes of Malik Kafur about the year 1310-1320 A.D. The shrine is a small one owing to the fact that only the Utsava Vigraham was brought over. Consequently a small Mula Vigraham would have been manufactured locally to serve as Mūlaberam, and installed within the shrine. The mantapam is spacious enough to accommodate the fairly large number of refugee Pancharatra worshippers who would have gone over from Srirangam to Tirumala for carrying on the worship according to the Pancharatra Agama, which is different from the Vaikhanasa Agama of the Tirumala temple. The spaciousness of the mantapam suggests that when Sri Ranganatha was here His daily services according to the Pancharatra agama were performed with great eclat by the large band of Sri Vaishnavas who accompanied that Deity. This left its mark on the present composite form of daily worship since developed in Tirumala and in the many festivals introduced which were before foreign to the Vaikhanasas. It is worth reminding that congregational worship in Srirangam was current even at the time the Silappadhikaram was composed (ut @TYS</li>

The Tirumalarayan and Anna Unjal Mantapam.
Next to the Ranga Mantapam and extending to within 12 feet of the east prākāram wall of the inner Gopuram is another spacious mantapam measuring 40 feet east to west and about 80 feet north to south. This mantapam consists of two parts constructed at different periods. The southern or inner portion (10 ft. x 45 ft.)
118
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
has a more elevated basement than the front one and might have been constructed by Saluva Narasimha in the middle of the 15th century for celebrating the Anna Unjal Tirunal instituted by him in the year 1473 A.D. This structure was renovated and extended to its present size and shape by Araviti Bukkaraja Ramaraja Srirangaraja Tirumalaraja in the last quarter of the 16th century. In this mantapam other festivals like the Vasantōtsavam, were also celebrated during Tirumalaraja&rsquo;s time. This Mantapam has finely carved high pillars depicting a warrior riding a horse standing erect on its hind legs over an elephant, etc. It is in this Mantapam that the Processional Deity, Malayappan has been annually holding His Asthanam or Durbar on the evening of the hoisting of the Garuda Dhvajam on top of the Dhvajastambham to mark the commencement of the Brahmotsavam. The prasadam distribution on this occasion called Tirumalarayan pongal is a delicacy greatly appreciated by pilgrims. Although the endowment made by him for that has disappeared, the pongal continues to be offered regularly. In the middle of the older structure stands the cut-stone carved pavilion where the Deity is seated for the occasion. This Mantapam practically touches a portion of the Dhvajastambham Mantapam At its north-east corner is a small raised pail where the elephant (on whose back during the Brahmotsavam days a pot of the water from the Akasa-ganga falls is brought in street procession) bends down for the person bringing the water to alight. The above structures are all on the southern side of the open space. On the northern side there is another Mantapam about 42 feet square with an enclosed room of about the same size in continuation. This room is called the Aina mahal, and is of late origin. Its front mantapam is now used for vending prasadams. In an article contributed to the Asiatic journal of the Year 1831 by the highest Revenue Officer of the district it is stated that Addāla (5) festival was being celebrated most likely inthe room in this mantapam the walls being lined with huge mirrors.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
ration of the Deity are thrown after removal. The tradition is that flowers on the hill should be used only for God and not for man. It is also the rule according all Agamas that flowers removed after use by the Deity should be deposited in a well.
Dhvajastambha Mantapam:-This mantapam appears to have been built for the purpose of affording shelter on the occasion of the Dvajārōhanam ceremony of the Brahmotsavam. As the festival occurs about the month of September when there are rains, a mantapam has always been a necessity. The Bali-pitham and Dhvajastambham which measure together about 15 ft. east to west stand practically in the centre of this mantapam in front of the inner gopuram. The Balipitam which stands in front of the Dhvajastambham is square in shape and made of cut-stone, broader at the base and decreasing by steps to a smaller size at a height of about 5 ft. The Bali-stone on top is about a foot in diameter. The structure was in recent years covered with gold gilt copper plates. The Dhvajastambham or flag-staff is a long piece of timber circular in section and encased in gold gilt copper sheeting. It stands on a cubical cut-stone structure also covered over with gold gilt copper sheets.
It is an uncommon thing that these two structures should be found outside the inner gopuram and in the space known as the third Avaranam (between the second and the third prākāram). In its earliest days this temple would have had only one Avaranam surrounding the Garbhagriham. The Agama rule, rather practice, in such a case is to locate Garuda, the Dhvajasthambham and the Balipitam in the first avaranam itself in the following order. Divide the frontage of the first avaranam into four equal parts. Garuda and Dhvaja would be in the second quarter, Garuda being nearest to the Vimanam. The Balipitam would be in the third quarter. Where there is a second avaranam also (the space between the inner gopuram and the first prākāram wall) Garuda would be placed in the second quarter of this avaranam and Dhvaja and Balipiṭam would come in the third quarter of the avaranam. This second avaranam was built about 1190 A.D. Garuda, the Dhvajastambham and Balipitam would therefore have been
120
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
within the second avaranam until the date of construction of the Tirumamani Mantapam about 1417 A.D. As that construction left little space for the Dhvajastambham and Balipitam, they were shifted to the third avaranam. The Vaikhanasa agama however recognises this arrangement also as a last resort; but they should be in the third quarter and not in the first where we find them now.
The other three sides, viz., south, west and north sides of the Sampangi Pradakshinam were, while constructing the prākāram walls, left as mere open space. But in due course, corridors of the mantapam type were constructed abutting the walls on one side and carried on pillars at the other end. These have high basement. On the south side this corridor is about 17 to 18 ft. in width, leaving an open space of 30 ft. width for the pradakshinam. But in recent times the corridor has been converted into a number of rooms for storing the samans of the floats for the floating festival and also for storing the wooden dolls used for decorating the car for the car festival. On the west side the corridor is 26 ft. in width, with three rows of pillars. A large part of this space has been converted into rooms called Ugranam (store room) for storing the provisions required for preparing food offerings such as rice, pulses, ghee, jaggery, sugar, oil etc. These are usually purchased in bulk and stored. The pounding and cleaning of rice, pulses and other articles are carried out here under the supervision of an officer called Ugranam Parpatyadar till recently. This duty was originally performed by the Jiyangar who about the year 1390 A.D. was entrusted with the task under the designation &ldquo;Koil Kelvi &quot; Jiyar. It was his job to examine and approve the quality of the articles and to issue the daily requirements. Without his permission no article would have been received or issued. It is stated in the Asiatic journal (already referred to) that in 1831 A.D. the Jiyangar assisted by his Ekangis was the Store keeper acting under the orders of the Parapatyadar (the chief officer). The north side corridor is similar to that on the west and has been converted into a number of rooms. The open space or the Pradakshinam on the west side is 22 ft. 6 in., wide while that on the eastern end is 25 ft. There is a long room known as Ramanuja Kutam where the portion of the food intended for pilgrims is freely distributed.
121
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The next room is known as Padi Potu where panyarams or (fried and baked preparations and sweets) are made for being offered to the Deity. As in these preparations portions of ghee and some other articles once used are kept over for future use, the place of preparation is removed from the kitchen where cooked food is prepared. Next to this room is the Yamunatturai where flower garlands are daily made to exact sizes required for decorating the Dhruva Beram and other deities. It owes its name to Yamunacharya or Sri Alavandar who is said to have given a start to this kind of work in his days. The next room is filled with articles of the float. The original purpose for which these corridors were constructed might have been for the procession of the Utsavar Beram around the Pradakshinam on rainy days when street procession was impracticable and also to afford shelter to pilgrims in inclement weather. That purpose, however, is not being served
now.
Saluva Narasimha&rsquo;s four Mantapams in
the Sampangi Pradakshinam.
At each of the four corners of the open space there is a small mantapam on four pillars measuring about 10 ft. square. These were constructed by Saluva Narasimha about 1470 A.D. in the name of himself, his wife, and his two sons. It was arranged that on almost all festival occasions the processional Deity should be seated at each of these and that food offerings should be made there and distributed to the pilgrims. Even now they serve the purpose during the forty days of Vasantotsavam soon after the Yugadi day. This pradakshinam is called in the inscriptions Sambaga chchurṛu (L) the word Sambagam being the Tamil equivalent of Sampangi or Champaka. There might have been several Champaka trees therein, whose sweet smelling flowers were daily offered to the Deity.
The Inner Gopuram.
After circumambulating the Sampangi pradakshinam we arrive at the inner gopuram. The inner gopuram measures at its base
122
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
24 feet east to west and 36 ft. south to north, the width of the gate-way or entrance being 9 feet. It is similar to the outer gopuram in design. The compound or prākāram walls emanating from this gōpuram measure on the outside 235 ft. east to west and 160 ft. north to south. These walls as in the case of the outer prākāram, are faced on both sides with well dressed cut-stone, the thickness of the walls being about 3 feet. There are numerous inscriptions on the outer as well as the inner face of these walls and also on the base and the walls of the gōpuram. The general feature of these is that the older inscriptions are on the basement and walls of the gopuram, the next in point of time being those on the inner face of the prākāram walls. The outer faces of these walls contain inscriptions of the 15th and 16th centuries.
The date of construction of the gopuram is not given in any inscription. There are however a number of these-some complete. some incomplete and others fragmentary-on the base and the walls of the gopuram itself which enable us to fix the date of construction with some degree of probability, if not of accuracy. The earliest of the complete inscriptions is on the south base (left inner side) dated the 19th regnal year of Tirukkalatti Devan. It records an endowment made by him of all the lands of Kudavur village to Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan for His daily Nimandam or daily worship and food offerings. There are two other inscriptions, one dated the 34th regnal year of Sri Viranarasinga Yadavaraya on the south base (right inner side) The other is an incomplete inscription of the Saka year Vikrama on the north base (left outer side) and it records the grant of some village (name missing) by Nayanar Pillai-Viranarasinga. The year Vikrama corresponds to 1220-21 A.D. The earliest inscription being of the year 1209 A.D. we can safely assume that the inner gopuram was then in existence. There are, however several other inscriptions which though fragmentary still enable us to state that the gopuram would have been constructed,</li>
<li>As the word Nayanar is prefixed to the name we presume that the inscription belongs to the later Chola period when either Viranarasinga or his son Pilla viranarastngar made the grant. The later Vikrama year 1280 A.D is not the likely one as the Cholas were not then in power and the prefix Nayanar would not have been used
123HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
at least the base portion of it, some time in 1160-1170 A.D. These inscriptions are on the north base of the gopuram and are partially hidden by the thickness of the prākāram wall which obviously was constructed a fairly long time after the gopuram itself. If at the time the inscriptions were made the construction of the pråkāram was at least in immediate sight sufficient space would have been left for the thickness of the wall while inscribing. Or it may be that this portion of the prākāram wall, was cut open and reconstructed in 1244-50 A.D. when the temple was renovated which will be discussed later. These inscriptions are largely the work of Sri Anandālvän&rsquo;s grandson Venkaṭatturaivar. Anandālvän is presumed to have been born in 1048 A.D. and would have been 90 years old when Sri Ramanuja died in 1137 A.D. Assuming that Anandalvan&rsquo;s son and grandson were born at intervals of 40 years, the grandson Venkatatturaivar would have been 10 years old when Sri Ramanuja died. The inscriptions made by him convey his pledge (probably to his father) to carry on the Nandavanam work and also the amudu padi and sattuppadi (either for Tiruvengadamudaiyan or for Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s temple in Tirumala).1 The temple or shrine of Sri Ramanuja might have come into existence about 40 years after his death. Seeing that a similar temple was in affluent state in Tirupati in 1220 A.D. the assumption of an earlier origin for the one in Tirumala is justifiable. Tradition ascribes the consecration of this shrine to Pillai Tirumalanambis. More details about this fragmentary inscription are given in the chapter on the temple of Govindarajaswami.
THE VIMANA PRADAKSHINAM.
After crossing the inner gopuram we enter the open space which is now called the Vimana Pradakshinam. This is a quadrangular space enclosed between the walls of the second prākāram</li>
<li>This is a fragmentary inscription 1.79 D on the East wall inner side south of the inner Gopuram which indicates something about Ramanuja Emperumanar on a day in Saumya year. This year can be no other than 1129-10 A.D. If the base of the inner gopuram was then in existence Anandalwar&rsquo;s son would have got it inscribed on the base like so many others. The inference therefore is that the inner gopuram was commenged after 1130 A.D.
124
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
of the inner gopuram and the walls of the first prakaram which surround the Sanctum. The open space of this Pradakshinam between the gateway of the inner gopuram and the large mantapam to the west of it, the Tirumamani or Mukha mantapam, is hardly 18 ft. Consideration of the Sanctum will be taken up later. In addition to the structures composing the Sanctum, there are a large number of other cut stone-structures, shrines and mantapams within this Vimana Pradakshinam. These leave a comparatively narrow width of open space surrounding the Sanctum. It is this open space which is called the Vimana Pradakshinam.
Anga Pradakshinam.
It is in this space that pilgrims circumambulate the Sanctum. Women and men while in great distress of body and mind some times take a special vow (or prarthana) that when freed from distress by the Divine Grace they would take a cold plunge bath in the sacred waters of the Swami Pushkarini and with the wet clothes on circumambulate the Sanctum in a prostrate condition. This circumambulation is called Anga Pradakshinam. The person rolls round the Sanctum on the stone pavement of the Vimana pradakshinam in a prostrate condition so that every part of the body touches the floor. Some attendant (a relation usually) would help him or her in keeping to the correct position and in changing at corners. The structures abutting the second prākāram wall will now be stated.
Sri Varadarajaswami shrine.
This shrine is about 7 feet to the south from the inner gopuram and 2 feet from the East prākāram wall. It is a small one about 20 feet in length and 15 feet in width and is dedicated to Sri Varadarajaswami. The history of this shrine will be given later. The pilgrim circumambulates this shrine also except during Anga pradakshinam.
An inscription on its north wall dated sixteenth regnal year of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya (1354-55 A.D.) shows that the Temple
125
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
was built before that date. It was probably built during the Malik Kafur&rsquo;s invasion of the South and was meant for Sri Varadarajaswami of Kanchi. To the south of this shrine is the main kitchen known an Potu and is about 61 ft. x 30 ft. standing on a basement 2 ft. high. The cooking of all articles for the day&rsquo;s food offering to the Deity is done here. New earthen pots only are used every day. Once used they are broken and never used again. The supply of these is a Mirasi right called Kumara Svarupam.. The supply of fire wood from the temple forests was also a Mirasi right. The present supply is however from Government forests taken on contract by the Devasthanam, the coupes being worked under the supervision of the Government Forest department. There is a small shrine inside and close to the door-way of the kitchen and the presiding Goddess therein is known as Madapuli Nächchiär, who keeps watch over the doings of the cooks. In front of this kitchen and adjoining the corridor which runs to the west is the well known Bangaru Bavi from which all the water required for the temple and the kitchen in particular is drawn. This well is considered to be a holy one. The site of it is as directed in the agama
Corridor:-The height of basement of the Corridor which starting from the kitchen runs west is the same as that of the kitchen. Its roof adjoins at one end the second prākāram wall while the other end is carried on cut-stone pillars. There is also an intermediate row of pillars 7 ft. distant from the end row. The total width is 19 ft.
Kalyana Mantapam.
The western end of the corridor has been converted into a large mantapam 80 ft. x 36 ft. called the Kalyana mantapam. The date of its construction is not known but it may be assigned to the end of the 16th century. Architecturally it is similar to the Tirumalaraya Mantapam. The pillars are exquisitely well carved and the ceiling of the roof of the central portion possesses beauty. At its western end is situated a small shrine with a small but beautiful mantapam carried on slender cut stone pillars well
126
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
sculptured and surmounted by a Vimānam. Behind the shrine is a raised portion called the Yagasala where Homams are performed in connection with Brahmotsavam and other festivals. This mantapam is called the Kalyana Mantapam because Kalyanotsavam (or marriage festival) is celebrated here. Whenever a pilgrim pays the prescribed fee and requires it to be done, Malayappan and His Consorts are brought here to take part in this festival. The mantapam and the festival are both of late origin. The festival is described in a separate chapter along with other festivals. This mantapam is also used by the processional Deity Malayappan and His consorts in connection with the Brahmotsavam and the Adhyayanotsavam for long periods. The idols are then housed in the small shrine above referred to and the decoration etc., take place in the small mantapam in front of it. From the day of Dhvajärōhanam of the Brahmotsavam to the day of the Dipävali Asthanam (in the Purattasi and Arppasi months) Malayappan resides here and not in the Sanctum Sanctorum. So also for a period of twenty-three days in the month of December in connection with the Adhyayanotsavam. The Asthanams take place during those days in this mantapam only.
The width of this mantapam necessarily contracts the open space of the Pradakshinam to about 11 feet width and even the processions of the Deity have to pass through this narrow space with difficulty.
The west corridor:-This corridor is similar to the one on the south side, but a little wider. It is also divided into a number of rooms for storing Vähanams. In a small room the Devasthanam publications are now being kept for sale. In this part of the Pradakshinam some Arjitam Festivals are sometimes celebrated in haste. A devotee might have taken a vow to perform a Garudōtsavam. But on that particular day it might not be possible to spare the time to take Deity in street procession on the Vahanam. In a case like that the Vahanam would be placed in the pradakshinam with the Deity seated thereon; the music played with tom tom and the harathi performed. A silver wand would during this short time be placed in the hands of the devotee who will go an even number of times round the Vahanam in
127
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
pradakshinam and the festival would be considered to have been fully performed. We next pass on to the Northern corridor. This one has acquired a little more importance than the others. At nearly the western end of this corridor which is an open verandah those who are religiously minded would sit down and read portions of religious books. The Madhwas will particularly be seen doing this. Standing at the edge of the corridor opposite to the north face of the Vimanam the pilgrim&rsquo;s attention would be drawn to the bas-relief representation of the gold gilt copper plate repousse of Sri Venkateswara the Dhruva Mürti, on the top portion of the Vimānam. On this side of the prākāram wall also are to be seen the most ancient inscriptions of the Chola period in full and also Sri Vira Krishna Devara Maharaya&rsquo;s endowments. There are a few rooms in the corridor which are occupied by the Mirăsi servants, such as the Gammikars (cooks), the Kaikālas or lighting servants and the Vagapadi (the place where panyarams are stored for purposes of issue or sale to pilgrims) people. There is also a room for keeping the pallaki (Palanquin) of the Deity. In another small room partitioned out of the verandah are preserved the copper plate engravings of songs in praise of Sri Venkateswara by Tällapakkam Annamacharya and his descendants. Next to this is the Sabha Arai which is the wardrobe of the used-up clothing of the Dhruva Mürti. Pilgrims are permitted to press this cloth to their forehead in veneration.
Sri Ramanuja Shrine.
The next one is the shrine of Sri Ramanuja, the great Sri Vaishnava Acharya. The history of this shrine will be given separately in this chapter. In front of the shrine and on a level with it is its Mukha mantapam. All Sri Vaishnavas worship here and receive tirtham and Sathari. There is however no independent puja for the Acharya. A portion of all prasadams offered to Sri Venkateswara is first transmitted to this shrine to be offered to Sri Ramanuja. Also, on several occasions the distribution of food offerings in goshti (i.e., according to the order of precedence) is made in this Mukha mantapam. Special honours are shown to this Acharya on certain festival occasions as he was responsible
128
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
for placing the worship and other affairs of this temple on a sound working basis. No other Acharya and none of the Alwars find a place in this temple although they have been admitted into the pantheon in other temples. Ramanuja&rsquo;s adherence to the Panchaatra form of worship did not stand in the way of the recognition f his shrine by the Vaikhanasa archakas, who serve him every day with tirtham and prasadam.
Sri Narasimhaswami Temple.
This shrine is much later in origin than that of Sri Ramanuja or of Sri Varadarajaswami. As will be seen from its position and its environs, it is a make-shift arrangement made in haste. The history of this will be given separately.
There were other rooms such as the Chandanam room and the Parimalam room which have since been removed. In the former the grinding of the sandal paste on the sandal stone was carried on daily by manual labour for making up the required quantity of chandanam. In the Parimalam room the articles of perfumery required for the daily abhishekam of Bhoga Srinivasa Mürti and for the Friday abhishekam of the Dhruva Mürti as well as punugu tailam, turmeric paste, saffron paste are prepared and kept here by the Periya Jiyar who supplies the same when required. Devotees who pay for the performance of Friday abhishekam are given these articles in separate silver cups to carry round the Vimana Pradakshinam and then to deliver them in the Garbhagriham before the abhishekam commences. Of the articles of sacred Panyarams the one which is known as Manoharam Undai (or ball) kept in Vagapadi room has acquired a special fame. On occasions when high dignitaries of State, Maharajas or great men of religious fame are received by the temple authorities in Tirumala, according to custom, Manoharam, Chandanam and Srīpādarenu are taken on a silver plate and given as a mark of distinction at a spot prescribed in the rules and regulations of the temple. This Manoharam is made of cleaned black gram and rice fried in ghee pounded, mixed with jaggery treacle and made into balls. Although other sweets of greater delicacy have come into vogue, Manoharam claims antiquny, priority and distinction.

CHAPTER VIII
PART (3)
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM.
In this part of the chapter the following subjects will be dealt
with.
The construction of the architecturally designed walls encompassing the old walls of the Garbha Griham and the construction and gold gilding of the Vimanam.
The demolition of the walls of the original first prākāram, the consequent mutilation of the stones bearing inscriptions, the construction of the walls of the present first prākāram and the use of the old stones bearing the mutilated inscriptions for lining the inner face of these walls.
The conversion of the front portion of the pradakshinam formed by the above walls into a room called Ramar Mēda.
The closure of the other three wings of the Pradakshinam also, from daily use. The conversion of the Snapana mantapam into a safe room and the construction of a new mantapam in front of it called Tirumamani manţapam.
The removal of the Garuḍālvar shrine, the Dhvajastambham and Balipitam from their old places to the present ones. The shrines of Sri Ranganatha, Sri Varadaraja and Sri Narasimha Swami. The shrine of Sri Ramanuja.
Facts which at one time would have been common knowledge have long since been forgotten. So also circumstances which gave rise to certain practices have been forgotten, but the practices have grown into usages which are now considered inviolable. Even silly ones which violate the dignity of man became sacerdotal.

As an example of the latter the difficulty which the poor pilgrim always had to face for worshipping Sri Venkateswara in His temple may be cited. Even the Finance Minister of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Rajah Raghottama Rao had to seek the help of Lord Clive to obtain the privileges of darsan due to his rank. He left a message to Lord Clive suggesting ways in which the hard lot of the poor worshipper could be bettered. In those days and even till 1933 A.D. the crowd was so unmanageable and the difficulties were so many that the servants in the temple, whose duty it was to maintain order within the Sanctum, got into the habit of using freely a deer skin thong on the back and even the head of the worshipper. The scene became so common that the worshipper soon attached to that blow a certain sanctity. He who did not receive that blow was considered to have been left unnoticed by Sri Venkateswara. People courted the blow. the scene the policeman and the boy scouts. policeman was an unwelcome figure on the Hill. the innermost precincts of the temple with his uniform and head dress. The agamas proclaim curses on the man who goes into the Temple with the upper part of his body covered with clothing. These are days when we seek the policeman and not our acharyas to help us in our devotional visits. Who enters the Sanctum now without a shirt on? In Tirupati itself there is a Gangamma temple -a sacredotal importance attached to the pujari of the Kshudra Devata-who during the days of the annual jatra goes through the streets with a broomstick and a dust pan.). Morning and evening women can be seen waiting with their young children for this priest to pass by and to hit the head of the children with his dust pan and the broomstick. This act is supposed to bestow on the recipient immunity from visitation by evil spirits and illnesses. So much importance is not attached even to the Sri Sathāri of Sri Venkateswara.

The real shape and size of the temple in Tirumala have remained a secret or a riddle. There are practices, rather usages in relation to the structures which no one can question and not even enquire into. Some of these will be described in this chapter for the first time. Even persons who are intimately and hereditarily connected with the working of the temple are not aware of these. A description
131
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of these practices has now been made possible by a study of the relevant inscriptions found on the walls of the temple and in the light of careful measurements of the Sanctum structures. Mathematical accuracy is not claimed for these measurements; but they are accurate enough for all practical purposes. There is really no such interval as off time&rsquo; in the daily routine work of the temple to afford facilities for taking measurements. There are again structures which are treated as sacred and which should not be subjected to measurement. Who could stretch a tape or a piece of string to measure the height or the width and girth of the Dhruva Bēram (Müla Mürti) and the other Bērams and appurtenances in the Sanctum? The entire structure including the Vimanam is proportioned to the size of the Dhruva Beram. The measurements taken subject to these limitations claim sufficient
accuracy.
The Garbhagribam and Mukhamantapam a double
structure.
For the first time we learn that the Sanctum Sanctorum, consisting of the Garbhagriham and the Mukhamantapam attached thereto, is a double structure. Two distinct and separate sets of walls do exist one set enclosing or gripping the other with perhaps an airspace (or antarmandalam) in between. The Vimanam was built along and in connection with the new (or outer) walls of the Garbhagriham between the years 1244 and 1250 A.D. The outer faces of the walls of the old temple bore at least four ancient inscriptions in Tamil referable to years 966 A.D., to 1013 A.D. True copies of these were taken before the new walls were built to enclose the old ones. By inference we learn that the old temple had a pradakshinam and prākāram walls surrounding it, wherein twenty oil lamps were daily burning and also that those präkāram walls were, and should necessarily have been, demolished to make room for the width of space required for the construction of the new walls of the Garbhagriham. In the process of demolition of the prākāram walls all old inscriptions relating to gifts and endowments made by members of the royal families of the Cholas and their feudatories and dependants got mutilated due to careless dismantling

work. A new set of prakaram walls was constructed for the new temple and such of the inscribed stones as were salvaged were lined on the inner faces of these walls. The outer faces of the new walls were kept perfectly clean and clear of inscriptions except for the ancient ones which were copied out from the walls of the old temple. We also learn that the local ruler Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya who probably financed the reconstruction work and who was a feudatory chief under the Pandya King Sundara Pandya and who raised himself soon to the status of a king, had himself weighed against gold and made use of that gold to make Tirumala rival in brilliance the Suragiri of the Devas. This should be taken to mean that after building the Vimanam he covered it with gold gilt copper plates. His overlord Sundara Pandya placed a gold gilt Kalasam on top of the Vimanam (about 1262 A.D.). The new first pradakshinam which was in use for some years after its construction was soon closed to the public and the front or eastern wing of it was walled up on the north and south sides converting the enclosed space into an apartment which is now called Ramar Meda ( GLOL σDOTS a) in front of the Mukhamantapam. Two inscriptions found on the south wall go to show that this closure might have taken place sometime between 1265 and 1285 A.D. The other three sides of the pradakshinam. now known as the Mukkoti pradakshinam were also closed to the public by doors placed at the two ends which are kept locked. except for two days in the year (.c.. on the Mukkoți Ekadasi and Dvadasi days). It is also noticed that the width of this pradak shinam is not the same on all the sides The north wing is more than double the width on the other two sides. The pillars in the middle row of the north wing indicate that the change of width was a eleventh hour idea. A Gomukham (or narrow passage in the wall to drain off water from the Garbhagriham) about nine feet in length running through the wall was built and subsequently closed, as it would have been found impossible to keep it functioning.
The outer face of the south and west prakaram walls was left untouched by the engraver&rsquo;s chisel for nearly 130 years between 1250 and 1380 A.D. and of the northern wall till 1446 A.D. In
133
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
this interval several endowments made by the Vijayanagar king and his feudatories and generals were inscribed in nooks and corners of the two gopuram structures and on the walls of minor temples. We have to, and shall speculate for a proper explanation of this phenomenon. There were additions made to the temple structures by converting the old snapana mantapam into a safe room and by the construction of a new asthana mantapam which went by the name of Tirumamani mantapam (which by the way is the name of the mythological ästhāna mantapam in Vaikuntam or the Sri Vaishnava Heavens). These were done early in the fifteenth century. Consequently, the shrine of Garuda āļvār, the Dhwajastambham and the Balipitam appear to have been shifted from their original position to their present place. The agama rules support this inference.
The above are the subjects which will receive attention in this part of the chapter.
The Sanctum Sanctorum-A Double Structure.
Reference is invited to the ground plan, drawn to scale, of the buildings composing the sanctum (attached hereto). The ground plan of the old temple is also marked thereon. The two are shown in different colours. Parts of the old temple which remain intact are shown in red colour. Portions which were demolished to make room for the new structures are shown hatched in red. The old prākāram walls and the pillars which supported the terrace of that pradakshinam, the old shrine of Garuda and the original site of the Dhvajastambam and Balipitam are the portions shown hatched.
The effective thickness of the walls of the Garbhagriham is found to be about seven feet two inches. In the language of the
6</li>
<li>The old silpis did not use the foot and the inch for setting out their buildings. Their measures were the dandam, the hastham and the mänängulam. The thickness of walls would usually be in hasthams and fractions thereof, such as quarter half and three quarters. Where extreme minuteness was called for, they might have used an eighth also. Twenty-four mänängulams made one hastham. The Sanctum Sanctorum had its size deter-
134
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
silpi this overall thickness is about five hasthams. The inner measurement of the Garbhagriham is about 12 feet 9 inches square; or nine hasthams (chaturasram sama vrittam) square. This is the largest size mentioned in the agamas, and is adopted for this temple as the Dhruva Bēram is very tall. The thickness of the walls invariably depends on the proportion which the area of the inside floor space of the Garbha griham bears to the area of the base of the proposed Vimanam which the walls have to carry. This proportion would vary on the quality of the stone available, the excellence of workmanship and the personal equation of the silpi. Ordinarily it would be. The other proportions are between 1/3 and and also 3/5, 4/7, 5/9, 6/11 etc. The proportion 1/3 would be for poor material and workmanship. The average would be 1. For our temple the area of the base of the Vimanam (if the old temple had a Vimānam) would have been (2x12'9&rdquo; x 12'9&rdquo;) 324 Sq. feet. Each side of the Vimanam would therefore have been 18 feet. This would give a wall thickness of 2 5/8 feet or 31 inches. The necessary thickness would thus be less than two hasthams. The silpi might have adopted two hasthams. As the overall effective thickness of the existing wall is 7 feet 2 inches or a little over five hasthams, it is clear that there are two walls enclosing the Garbha griham, the inner one being a little less than two hasthams and the outer a little more than three hasthams in thickness. Calculation shows that a thickness of four-feet, or two and three quarter hasthams, would meet the requirements of safety. The overall thickness of five hasthams might have been
mined so as to be proportionate to the size and the posture of the Dhruva Bēram (Múla Mürti). For a Murti of the standing posture with no other murti by the side, the room will be square in size, called Ekatalam or single plot. The dimensions of the sides would depend on the height of the Dhruva Bēram. As the hastham refers to the human hand it would vary in length. It was therefore the habit of the silpis to leave engraved on a stone slab in a safe part of the building the exact measure of the hastham adopted.
Such a stone does not appear to have been yet spotted in the Tirumala Temple. But from the dimensions of the Garbhagriham it is clear that the hastham adopted would measure about 17 inches in length.</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
made up of outer walls of three hasthams closely gripping the inner walls of two hasthams thickness. Or it might be that the calculated thickness was employed in both cases and an air space of about 6 inches left between the two sets of walls. This space would be called àn Antarmandalam&rsquo; or antaralam or void left between the two structures. The latter supposition might be the correct one judged by the language used for describing the two structures in inscripsion I. 88. The Tamil expression used for the old temple is Koyil Alvär (the saintly abode). The second structure is called Koyilalvārku koyil (கோயிலாழ்வார்க்கு கோயில்) or the temple for the Koyilälvär. The latter is a well understood term among Sri Vaishnavas. In fact every house where puja is offered to God in some form or other would possess a wooden structure of the usual type having one room and a small mantapam in front of the same height as the room. It usually has only a flat roof. It is not improbable that the original temple in Tirumala was of this pattern, but of a large size and in cutstone. If this assumption is correct, that temple might not have had a Vimanam until the construction of the new temple took place sometime between 1244 and 1250 to 1262 A.D. The method employed for constructing a new temple did in no way adversely affect the old structure, which would have been considered very sacred because it was presumed to have been built by the Devas themselves.
The Motive for Renovation.
There were beautiful temples built for images made and consecrated by man (Manusha pratishța), in other places. Here was a poor temple on the most sacred Hill for a Svayam-vyakta Murti. The temple was attracting streams of enlightened men. Judged by the fact that the walls of the old temple had on its three faces four long ancient inscriptions, the surface of these walls would have been plain and devoid of any architectural features and sculptures worth mentioning. It probably had no Vimanam to boast of. The word Vimanam does not occur in our inscriptions till about 1262 A.D. in which year Sundara Pandya is said to have placed a gold gilt sikharam on top of it. Every other temple of fame conducting puja according to the Vaikhanasa or the
136
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
Pancharatra agama had a Garbhagriham whose architecture answered to the agamic stipulations. The Yadavarayas were the patrons of this temple and Sri Vira Narasinga was the most famous of these, having risen from the rank of a chieftain to that of a king. He set his heart on building a temple worthy of his Patron Deity and of his own importance. He and his queen were of a devout disposition and had already given away Paiyinḍipalii village for several services in the Tirupati temple, including the construction of the big four faced car, its gold gilt kalasam etc. To the Vaikhanasa archakas also it meant a higher status since the new temple would make adequate provision for the installation of all or most of the Deities which according to their agama should find representation even during the daily puja.1
It has to be pointed out in this connection that in those days the daily puja was a function in which none but the Vaikhanasa archaka had a share. The Jeeyars came into the temple a century and half later. There was no recitation of the Tamil Prabandham at any stage of the puja, nor for that matter any where in Tirumala. The First Alvar for whom a shrine was erected was Tirumanga alvar. It was erected in Tirupati in 1234 A.D. It was an independent temple for which the Tirumala Sthanattars agreed to be trustees. Fifty years later (about 1287 A. D.) a shrine for Nammāļvār was also built at Tirupati (near Alwar Tirtham). Tirumoli was sung in Tamil during the Brahmotsavam in Tirupati only from the year 1259 A.D. But no such Tamil song was sung in Tirumala. The only person who played a part in the daily puja was some member of the family of Tirumala Nambi who recited mantrapushpam slokas during the puja and that was in Sanskrit. Neither the Vaikhanasa nor the Pancharatra agama of those days countenanced the recital of the Tamil prabandham in congregational worship of the kind mentioned in Silappadhikaram as having been in vogue in Srirangam as early as 756 A.D. (u Q465). The recitation of the Vedas in congregation daily or during the festivals is not mentioned in any of the early inscriptions. It was only in the first quarter of the fifteenth century</li>

137
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
that Sri Virapratāpa Devaraya Mahārāya made arrangements for employing twenty-four mahajans for this service, two persons serving by turns every month. The descendants of Tirumala Nambi and Anandāļvar who were the Acharyapurushas of the Temple appear to have been the only Sri Vaishnavas who were associated with the Archakas in daily worship. The renovation work of the temple would therefore have been influenced more by the notions of the Vaikhānasa āgama (marichi samhita).
The Renovation work of the Garbhagribam.
In the inscription I. 88 the old temple is called the Köyil alwär and the renovation work is called Kōyil or Temple. The latter was meant to serve as a temple to house the former, which even now is called Kōyilālvârs. The idea is a novel one, because there is no space left between the walls of the two, as far as we can see. Even if there be a space it is not visible. There is nothing said about the Vimanam, whether it is a new one constructed by Vira Narasinga on the walls of the new Koyil or whether there was an old one which was improved by him.1
The old temple also had a covered corridor surrounding it on all sides, with an open or covered antarāļam to permit rain water from the vimanam or roof to flow into the drain below surrounding the walls. These had to be demolished to make room for the foundations and walls of the new structure. A reference to the ground plan, which shows the old as well as the new structures, will make this clear to the reader. The old prakaram walls should have been demolished before the foundations for the new temple were laid. The inscription does not speak of the old prakaram walls nor does it state in clear terms that new prakaram</li>
<li>If measurements are taken of the base and the height of the present Vimanam it would be easy to form a correct notion. Sentiment however makes it an act of pollution to tread upon the terrace of the pradakshinam for taking measurements. This pradakshinam is now known as the Mukkōți Pradakshinam and has been a closed enclosure open to the worshippers only on two days in the year as already stated. People go round and scribble on the walls of the Garbhagriham also on those two days. But treading on its terrace is an act of sacrilege.

walls were built. It says that certain old inscriptions which were on the walls of the old temple and true copies of which were already taken (before building the new temple walls) should be reengraved on the outer face of the north wall of the first prakaram.1 That there were the old prakaram walls together with pradakshinam could easily be understood from the very large number of stones showing fragmentary and incomplete inscriptions which have been built into the inner face of the walls of the new pradakshinam and also the roughly dressed bald round stone columns used in the new pradakshinam. These columns do not go well with architectural beauty and finish of the new temple walls. The inner faces of the new prakaram walls containing fragmentary inscriptions on the roughly dressed faces of the old stones present a sorry contrast to the walls of the new temple. The portion of the old temple from which these stones could have come should be the old prakaram. The new pradakshinam along with its prakaram walls is also called a templc in the inscription. &ldquo;கோயிலாழ்வார்க்கு Cari Caru (a temple for the temple of the Koyilālvār). It is unusual to call the first pradakshinam a temple. A temple usually contains an image for worship. So we must presume that this new pradakshinam was designed to hold within it one or more images for worship. The design of the outer face of the new Garbhagriham walls and the closure of the antaralam space in the roof of the pradakshinam support this view. A look at the plan and elevation of the south wall will show that a niche is sculptured centrally in the body of the wall. There are similar niches on the western and northern walls also. is) one on the east wall also, a little to the south of the doorway. This has been covered up by one of the thick walls subsequently formed which enclose the Ramar Mēdai. The space enclosed by these two bits of walls on the south and north sides formed the eastern wing of the new pradakshinam. This was however subsequently walled up. These niches form an essential feature of the design of garbhagrihams according to the Vaikhanasa as well as the Pancharatra agamas. The Vaikhanasas attach greater

importance to them. In fact they would have had three more niches at corners on the south. west and north faces to instal deities in all these. It is with a view to preventing ram water from dripping upon and beating against the images that the antaralam or open space in the terrace was closed, leaving only. small openings to admit a little light.
North side of the Pradakshinam.
For some reason which cannot be ascertained the north wing of the new pradakshinam was made very much wider than the wings of the other sides. On all the sides one end of the roof rests on the prakaram walls. The other end is carried on stone beams resting on stone columns of circular section. As was already stated these columns and the beams have no claim to beauty and stand unfavourably by the side of the fine walls of the Sanctum. On the north side the greater width was negotiated by an intermediate row of columns. But these columns (seven in number) being shorter than those in the other row are supplemented by short lengths of cutstone basc similarly shaped. This leads to the suspicion that the idea of making this wing wider was an after thought and that such stones as were readily available were used.
It was also pointed out already that the construction of a Gomukham through a wall about nine feet thick was the result of hasty execution. A Gomukham which connects the interior of the Garbhagriham with the pradakshinam to serve as a drain should necessarily be of small calibre but capable of being kept clean and clear of all obstruction. Probing with a piece of stick a hole nine feet in length could not be managed from the inside of a shrine which is 12&rsquo; square and having little free space. Probing from the outside could be managed only if the pradakshinam is more than about 10 feet width. Even so clogging matter would not be permitted to be driven back into the Garbhagriham. So the Gomukham seems to have been closed ultimately. The wider space on the</li>

140
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
north side would have been used for holding Asthanams which were increasing in number. There was really no other mantapam in the temple during those days The snapana mantapam had its specific purposes to serve.
First Pradakshinam soon closed.
We however find that this first avaranam or pradakshinam deliberately built was soon closed. Two inscriptions on the south face of the south wall of the Ramar Medai go to show that this closure would have taken place sometime after 1262 A.D. when sundara Pandya placed a gold gilt kalasam on top of the Vimanan and when in all likelihood Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya made a gold gilt copper sheet covering to the vimanam. The two inscriptions above referred to relate to one Vijayaganda Gopala, a Telugu Pallava chieftain who was one of Sundara Pandya&rsquo;s adherents just like Vira Narasinga. The date usually assigned to him as a ruler is 1250-1285 A.D. But his political life should have commenced much earlier. There are fragamentary inscriptions on the inner face of the Mukkoti pradakshinam walls which go to show that some of his gifts were made before the construction of the new temple and of the new prakaram walls. Of the two inscriptions which are on the south wall of the Ramar Meda one is a complete inscription and was presumably inscribed after that wall (of the Ramar Meda) was constructed. It extols Vijayaganda Gopala for his charitable disposition and states that every living being was benefited by him and that every one was grateful to him. The other inscription is an incomplete one and even fragmentary. The queen of Vijayaganda by name Devarasi ar presented cows for the perpetual lighting of three lamps in Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s temple. When an incomplete inscription of this type is seen on a new wall of a later date the inference would be that the stone was originally in some other place and was subsequently taken out and set in its present place. It would originally have been on the South wall of the new prakaram at its junction with the east wall. To form the Ramar Meda that end would have been cut open and the stones, moved in the process used for the Ramar Meda wall. The inscribed stone might have got mutilated in the process of
141HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
removal and resetting. The surmise therefore is that the Rāmar Mēda was formed sometime between 1262 and 1285 A.D. The eastern end of the south and the north prakaram walls would thus have been opened out while walling up the Ramar Meda. Although the formation of the Ramar Meda blocked up the eastern wing, the other three sides of the pradakshinam were perhaps open to the public for some years. The doors and the walls which now completely seal the pradakshinam are of later date and are not in keeping with the other parts of the structure.
The intention of the builders to treat this first pradakshinam as a Kōyil for four additional Murtis was frustrated by the formation of the Rāmar Mēda although the other three sides since remain open to the public. It could not be classed as a pradakshinam as it is incomplete having lost the eastern wing. The locking up of the passages has also a purpose and significance. It prevented the Pancharatras from making an attempt to form a Chatur murti alayam by putting up Pancharatra images on the south, west and north walls of the Garbhagriham.
The Closure of the Mukkoti Pradakshinam and the formation of the Room, Ramar Meda-Reasons.
The architectural features of the new temple presented scope and facilities for extending the Vaikhanasa form of worship to the maximum limit. The images on the Vimanam are all of the Vaikhanasa pantheon-Purusha, Satya, Achyuta, and Aniruddha on the first tier and those above likewise. We need not here go into it at length. Lower down on the walls of the Sanctum are provided niches wherein Satya, Achyuta, Aniruddha and Purusha might be installed and consecrated. The pradakshinam was constructed in a manner to serve this end. The ideal Vaikhanasa temple should have nine Murtis. If Nara Narayana, Vārāham and Narasimha were also installed in addition to Purusha Satya, Achyuta and Anirudhha a completely equipped Vaikhanasa temple would have been the result. The Pancharatras also favour a Pancha (five) Murti temple. Instead of Satya etc., they would prefer to instal the Vyuha avatars Sankarshana, Pradhyumna and Aniruddha and
142
THE TIRUMALA TIMPLE-THE SANGTUM
Vyuha Vasudeva. It would not stop there. Within the Garbha griham itself Brahma, Siva, Markhandeya and Bhrigu have a right to be installed according to the Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra agamas. Vikhanasa Rishi himself would be placed at the second doorway. They have been and, I believe, are still having their share in the daily puja mentally. Once the installation of new deities was permitted all these would have been installed. Ganesa and Durga, would also come in. Would the followers of Sri Ramanuja and others of the Alvar school of Bhakti have looked on these possibilities with complacence?
In this context we have to review the changes through which temple worship has been passing. The Murtis installed and the form of the worship are only concrete presentations of certain metaphysical ideas of the later Pancharatras. The primeval Being or Paran is conceived of as going through some evolutions for purposes of destruction, creation and sustenance. These are called Vyüha avatars. He is credited with six gunas or characteristic divine powers for these purposes. They are the pairs Gñanam, Balam; Aisvaryam, Tejas; and Sakti, Viryam which are the essential powers required for destruction, creation and sustenance. All the six gunas are however present in each. In the conception and modes of evolution the Vaikhanasa differs from the Pancharatrin and Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Visishtadvaitam differs from both the above. It is the representation of the above mentioned Vyuha forms that creates differences between the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra. According to Sri Ramanuja and his commentator Sri Vedanta Desika these Vyuha froms are not avatars in prakrita sarira like the Vibhava avatars. They are only aprakirta forms having specific powers of the Supreme Being to be meditated upon by Yogis for the attainment of special spiritual faculties. Then again in the actual work of creation, Brahma is said to have sprung from the navel of Vishnu and Siva or Sankara sprang from the irate forehead of Brahma. Brahma was commissioned to create this world and its living beings. His first attempt ended in a failure as the first ones he created, Sanaka etc, were pure Sätvic beings who had no desire to procreate and who straight away merged into the Supreme Being. Brahma in his mood of frustration created from his irate
143
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
forehead Siva or Sankara who was full of Tamöguna.
That also having failed to fulfil his purpose he created the Svayambhu Manu who peopled this world and so on. This story is briefly told here because they were being represented in a concrete form in temples, and images installed and consecrated according to the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra agamas. We know that Poygai Muni and Pey Alvar took delight in worshipping Sri Venkateswara when dressed to look partly like Vishnu and partly like Siva. That happened before the Image of Sri Venkateswara came to be worshipped according to the Vaikhanasa agama. In the normal Vaikhanasa temple the Garbhagriham area would be cordoned into four zones. The central one is known as Brahmya where the flowers etc., of worship are deposited. The standing Dhruva Murti would be installed in the next zone called Daivika. In other cases a portion of the next zone called Manusham would also be taken up. The outermost zone is called Paisacham. While the Dhruva Murti is in the Daivikam, Brahma would be in the Manusham close to the wall on the right and Siva would be in the Paisacham zone close to the wall on the left. Markhandeya and Bhrughu would be in a bending and kneeling posture close to the Dhruva Murti. The Vaikhānasas who pride in calling themselves Adi Vaishnavas conceived of this arrangement in their zeal. Siva in particular is made to wait on Vishnu and is represented as a being born from Brahma and full of Tamōgunam. He would receive a Nyasa flower only after all the Vyuha Murtis and Devatas have been propitiated. Havis or food offering made to Siva in this manner is considered fit to be partaken of only by menial servants. To those who can follow the details of the form of worship and who happen to be non-Vaishnavites the procedure would be provocative. But to the common run of temple goers it would mean that Brahma, Vishnu and Siva form Trimurtis of equal status. In fact, the Vaikhanasa procedure defeats its purpose. The only benefit was to the Archaka who would receive more food offering in the name of each of these images. The Visishtadvaithins of the Ramanuja School would have considered this form of worship as pantheistic. They are monotheists owing allegiance to Vishnu alone. There is another objection to the introduction of the Vaikhanasa images in the temple. The ancient tradition about Tirumala is that Brahma is every night doing
144
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-TIE SANCTUM
puja to Sri Venkateswara in this temple. The absurdity of setting up images of Brahma, Siva etc., and of the Vyuhas should therefore be apparent. Brahma would worship only his creator Para Vasudeva. Sri Ramanuja is said to have converted all the ancient temples in Southern India to the Pancharatra form of worship, because the latter quickly adapted themselves to forms suited to Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s metaphysical ideas. They abandoned the setting up of those images which irritated both friends and foes. The Vaikhanasa archakas also took to the Pancharatra form as modified by Sri Ramanuja. In Tirumala there was no necessity for him to interfere, because right from the commencement the worship was for one Murti only (Eka Murti), although the orthodox Vaikhānasa considered it the Adhama form of worship. The Kautuka Beram (or Bhoga Srinivasa) was made and consecrated during the days of Sri Alavandar and bears the impress of the Shadgunya yantram of Sri Venkateswara, or Para Vasudeva manifesting Himself on earth. There has been no other Dhruva Murti in that temple. The old temple did not display on its outer or inner face any feature which would lend itself to the installation of any other Deity. Sri Ramanuja did not therefore find any necessity to change the Vaikhanasas over to Pancharatra. They carried on worship agreeably to his metaphysical ideas. All the flowers during &rsquo;nyasam&rsquo; are deposited between the feet of the Dhruva Murti. Even the Bali offering is not made in detail, but all are deposited en masse, as it it were, on the five Bali stones which stand between the Dhvajastambham and the Bali pitam. The possibility of Purusha, Satya etc., being installed in the renovated temple and of other images, in consequence thereof, in the Garbhagriham or elsewhere in the temple was shut out by closing up the front portion of the first avaranam (pradakshinam)and therefore the place of &lsquo;Purusha&rsquo; in particular.
Whether this closure took place during the life time of Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya or later it is not possible to say. The complete closure of the pradakshinam might have been done with a view to screening from public view all vestiges suggestive of the attempt to make vital innovations inthe form of worship.Vijayaganda Gopala (Telugu Pallava) became a frequent visitor to Tirumala;
10
145
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
he arranged for the feeding of pilgrims during the festivals in Tirupati and Tirumala and so endeared himself to the Sri Vaishnavas of those days that an inscription on the south wall of the Ramar Meda (one of the two walls which effectually prevented innovation being made in the temple worship) extols him as one at whose hands every one was benefited and to whom every one felt grateful. The great protagonists of the Visishtadvaita Siddhantam in those days were Nadādür Ammal and Kidambi Appullar of Kanchi who would undoubtedly have shaped the religious faith of Vijayaganda Gopala. His attachment to the temple in Tirumala at this juncture (more so after the death of Vira Narasinga) has therefore a special significance.
The non-recognition of other Murtis is the basic principle of the Tirumala temple. There are shrines for Varadarajaswami and Narasimhaswami; but separate puja is not offered to these. There are the images of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna. They share the worship offered to Sri Venkateswara. It has been the custom from the carliest times that even on the days of Sri Rama Navami, Sri Jayanti and Nrisimhajayanti the speial food offering is made to Sri Venkateswara and not to the concerned deity. This is the main reason for prohibiting the erection of any other temple in Tirumala. Processions connected with festivals for alien deities or even acharyas were not allowed. Even the Sri Vaishnava Alvārs were not given recognition in their individual capacity. But in recent years, these ancient usages and customs have been lost sight of.
The Outer Faces of the Walls of the First Prakaram.
(Vimana Pradakshinam.)
It was stated in the earlier portion of this chapter that except for the four ancient inscriptions which were re-engraved on the outer face of the north wall of the first präkāram in the year 1250 A.D. there were no new ones made for about 130 years thereafter on the south and west walls. On the north wall however it was only in 1446 A.D. (two centuries after the re-engraving of the ancient ones) that the next inscription was made. This requires some
comment.
146
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
Inscriptions of endowments made by very great men between the years 1250 and 1380 A.D. are found in other places in the temple and not on the walls of this prākāram. There must be some reason for avoiding the clean walls of this Vimana Pradakshinam.1
During all this period of about 120 years the walls of the first prakaram were left without a scratch of the engraver&rsquo;s chisel. Inscriptions were made in odd corners. Endowments mentioned</li>
<li>Of those made during the reign of Jatavarman Sundara Pandya I, one is by Vira Narasinga himself in 1262 A.D. of the grant of the village of Padirivedu which is inscribed on the north base of the inner gopuram. Sundara Pandya&rsquo;s ratification of an old Chola grant of two villages situated on the banks of the Kaveri is inscribed on the west base. The inscription which records the Tularōhanam of Vira Narasinga and the use of that gold for gilding the Vimanam is on the south base. There are again a large number of inscriptions in Sanskrit Grantha characters which sing the glory and fame of Sundara Pandya. All these are recorded in some part or other of the base of the inner gopuram. Inscriptions of grant made to Mahapradhani Singayya Damnayaka of the village of Pōngalur and of his endowment of the same for specific services (including a daily sardhi food offering); of another endowment by Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya himself of the years 1328, 1332 A. D. are on the outer face of the second prakaram wall to the south of the inner gopuram and two in Sri Govindarajaswamy Temple, Tirupati. Inscriptions of endowments made during the reign of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya between the years 1339 and 1360 A.D. are also in other parts of the temple. (1-104. 1339 A.D. is on the outer side of the east wall north of the inner gopuram ; another 1-106, 1357 A.D. on the north wall of Sri Varadarajaswami Temple; I-109, 1358 A.D. which states that he built a palace for himself on the Tirumala hill is on the door jamb wall of the Padikavili or outer gopuram). Inscriptions of endowments made by the Vijayanagar Mahanayakkar brothers, Yeriamanchi Pappunayakkar and Periya l&rsquo;emmu Nayakkar are also on the door jamb wall of the outer gopuram.
I 41-1262 A.D. 1 45 1264 A.D.
An inscription which records the gold gilding of the Vimanam by Mahamandaleswara Mangi Deva Maharaja (in grantha and in Kannada Script) are on the north base of the innner gopuram. The grant of a village by the Vijayanagar Emperor Bukkaraya (about 1365 A.D.) for daily sandhi &lsquo;offering and Brahmotsavam and gift of cows by the Vijayanagar Prince Vira Kumara Kempanna are recorded on the outer gopuram door jamb wall.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
in the foot note were made by great warriors who saved Hinduism and its temples from Muslim spoliation and vandalism. Emperors -Bukkaraya and Sundara Pandya; the Yadavaraya rulers, Mangidēva Mahārājah, Vira Kumāra Kempanna and the Mahānāyakkar brothers visited Tirumala, worshipped Sri Venkateswara and made their endowments as thanksgiving offerings for the success they achieved against the Muslims. Wt made them refrain from having their endowments inscribed in the most conspicuous place which should have been staring before them as blank surface? We are left to speculate on this.
Why were the walls of the Vimana Pradakshinam left bare for more than a century?
We may take it for certain that Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya would not have felt proud of the temple he built in spite of the fact that he had the Vimanam covered with gold gilt plates and that Sundara Pandya placed a gold gilt kalasam on top. The use of the old rough-chiselled stone columns in the new pradakshinam bears testimony to this view. He would have been smitten with remorse at the sight of the mutilated stones bearing fragmentary inscriptions lining every side of the inner prākāram. He would also have been told, though at a very late hour, that the smothering of the old temple was uncalled for and that the architectural features of the new temple were not in keeping with the Eka Murti tradition of the place. He might himself have had the pradakshinam closed and Ramar Meda built in his life time itself.
But what followed after his death would have weighed considerably with those who visited the temple and made endowments in later years. It is not known who succeeded him as king, for he assumed the emblems of royalty and had his Tularōhanam. The use of that gold to gild the Vimanam of Sri Venkateswara would not have been considered by the wise men of those days as an appropriate use. Service to God should be in a spirit of true humility. Tularohanam in connection with his assuming the emblems of royalty was quite the opposite in spirit. The fact that no one worthy of the name succeeded him and that between 1264 and
148
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
ab ut 1320 A.D. there was a sort of interregnum in his domain, would have been pointed to as a sign of divine displeasure. It was only about the year 1320 A.D. that we hear of Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya as ruler of the country. He perhaps assumed that name in the spirit that he governed in the name of that God.
South India itself was in a perilous state. Sundara Pandya&rsquo;s conquests up to the river Krishna and the gold gilt Kalasam which he placed over the Vimanams in the temples in Tirumala, Kanchi, Chidambaram and Srirangam did not secure peace to the country. He seems to have had troubles nearer home. Historians tell us that sub-kings had to be appointed to appease his kith and kin. Jaţavarman Vira Pandya became sub-king in 1253 A.D. In 1268 A.D. Māravarman Kulasekhara succeeded as Emperor. Jațăvarma Sundara Pandya II was made sub-king in 1276 A.D. Māravarman Vikrama Pandya II in 1283; Jatavarman Sri Vallabha in 1291 A.D.; Vira Pandya II in 1296 A.D. and Jatavarman Sundara Pandya III in 1303 A.D. Māravarman Kulasekhara the Emperor, was murdered in 1310-11 A.D. That was the signal for a civil war between Sundara Pandya III and Vira Pandya II. Muslim help was sought by one of these and the invasion of the south by Malik Kafur was the result. These events would have had their repercussions in Tonḍaimandalam also. Tirumala at any rate seems to have been a no-man&rsquo;s land at the end of the thirteenth century. In between 1264 and 1328 A.D. there is a solitary Inscription dated cyclic year Kilaka and Saka 1230 (1308 A.D.) I. 98 which is recorded on the north wall of Sri Andal&rsquo;s shrine in Tirupati. This endowment makes provision for the feeding of devotees resorting to the temple on certain special festival occasions. Inscriptions were being invariably dated citing the regnal year of the local ruler or his overlord. In this instance there is no reference to the name of the ruler and the regnal year. For a similar situation we have to go back to the Saka year 824 (902 A.D.). That was a period when the Pallava rule had broken down and the Chola rule had not effectively taken its place. The Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanoor acted on their own responsibility in expending the nett proceeds of taxes for the &ldquo;upkeep of the temple and the Saka year is cited. After a lapse of nearly 400 years there is now a
149
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
similar situation. The Pandyan rule had broken down although it was least felt in Tirumala. There was no local ruler whose name and regnal year the donors of the endowment could cite. The cyclic cum Saka year was therefore cited. The citation of the regnal year is again reverted to from 1328 A.D. to the closing days of Sriranganatha Yadavaraya in 1360 A.D. All the misfortunes to the country would naturally have been attributed to Vira Narasinga&rsquo;s impropriety in closing up the old temple and in erecting a new one which pointed to innovations in temple worship. Even in our days we find ignorant people attributing the failure of rains and consequent famine to the so called sins of the Governments.
The Muslim invasions would have been considered a sign of divine wrath. If Malik Kafur had marched down by the Damalcheruvu or the Kalahasti route, Tirumala with its new gold gilt Vimanam and Sikharam would have afforded him the first good booty. But he selected the western route. That choice would have been attributed to the Will or the Sankalpam of Sri Venkateswara. The Hoysala king Vira Ballala was one of the first sufferers as his capital was ransacked. But he soon made peace in 1313 A.D. with the Delhi Emperor Allauddin Khilji by becoming his vassal. Malik Kafur plundered other temples in the South and had to return to Delhi. Mubarak who became Emperor in Delhi sent in 1316 A.D. another invasion and Devagiri was annexed to his empire Vira Ballala therefore took the necessary precautions to meet a further attack on him.
The mountain passes in the Tirupati hills had to be protected. He did this by sending his Minister and Commander Mahapradhani Singayya Dannayaka to Tirupati to be an ally and military protector to the local ruler. (I. 102, 99). From the language used in the inscription of his endowments we find that he was a highly cultured Sri Vaishnava. He therefore sought Divine help by inducing Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya, the local ruler, to grant a village from the income of which a daily food offering called Sitakara ganda Sandhi was instituted for the first time. (I. 99. 1328). The Yadavaraya himself made another endowment for a similar Sandhi offering for the merit of his forebear Yadava Narayana. (I. 100.
150
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
1332 A.D.) But both were careful to avoid making the inscription on the walls of the first Prakaram whose faulty construction wrought havoc. The inscriptions were therefore made on the second prakaram wall and in Tirupati.
As a result of the Muslim invasion the Utsava Beram of Sri Ranganatha Swami of Srirangam was carried by a circuitous route to Tirumala for safety. Here the idol was receiving separate worship till about 1360 A.D. when it was reconveyed to Srirangam on the annihilation of the Muslim Sultanate of Madura. Sri Vedanta Desika (one of our great acharyas of those days) composed his Dayasatakam in praise of Sri Venkateswara during the period of invasion and his Abhitisthavam before Sri Ranganatha in Srirangam after the downfall of the Sultanate. A confederation of the Hindu rulers under the leadership of Vira Kumara Kempanna the Vijayanagar prince, brought success to the Hindus. The names of all the great men connected with the struggle and the endowments made by them as thanks-giving were mentioned above. The still blank walls of the first prakaram could have been pointed to as the mysterious cause of all troubles or as one too sacred to be touched by the engraver&rsquo;s chisel. It is also possible that none of these entered the first pradakshinam as it would have been kept closed.
The Spell Broken after 1360 A.D.
The spell was however broken after 1360 A.D. Sri Ranganatha the last of the Yadavarayas left no successor. As a result of the political changes in the country the Vijayanagar king became the overlord of South India. Mangideva Mahārāya seems to have been appointed Viceroy of Tonḍaimandalam. A new set of Sthanattar or trustees came into existence for the management of the Temple. They were natives of Tirupati and knew that there could be nothing wrong with the walls at any rate.
Alagappiranar Tirukkalikanri dasar who was the leader (or Mudaliar) among the Sri Vaishnavas of Tirupati was the first to have his endowment inscribed on the south wall of the prakaram
151HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
in 1380 A.D. (I. 184, 1380 A.D.) This was followed by Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar in 1390 A.D. since he then rose into importance having become the &lsquo;kartar&rsquo; or manager of the Arisanālayam Nandavanam and matam and also one of the Sthanattar of the temple. Then followed other inscriptions. But the north wall was still left untouched till 1446 A.D. in which year Periya Mallayadeva Mahārāja had his endowments inscribed by the side of the ancient inscriptions of the Chola period. The famous Sāluva Narasimharaya also left some of his inscriptions on the north wall. But Sri Virapratapa Vira Krishna deva Maharaya made the greatest use of the north wall even by extending its length (and encroaching into the width of the Vimanapradakshinam). The great gifts made by him and his two queens are inscribed on the north wall and some are also on the south wall. The outer and the inner faces of these walls contain valuable information commencing from about 900 A.D. to the end of the 16th century and some are of even later date. The careful protection of these from the des tructive effects of sun and rain is a matter worthy of attention.
The Snapana Mantapam.
This is now a dark room which we enter after crossing the Bangāru Väkili or the golden door way of the temple. It is being used more as a safe room and not as Snapana Mantapam for performing special Abhishekam on certain calendar days. It is no longer a mantapam. The four cut-stone pillars standing in the centre of the room are the only vestiges of the mantapam. Even these pillars do not appear to be the original ones. The old pillars set up about 960 A.D. would have been of circular section. What we now see are square in section, a pattern common during the Hoysala and Vijayanagar periods.
It was in this place, then known as Tiruvilankōyil, that the silver Mürti (Bhōga Srinivasa) received His Abhishekam and consecration in 966 A.D. The western wall and the doorway into the Rāmar Mēda would have been constructed (or reconstructed in its present shape) alongwith the new temple and prakaram walls. The other three sides would have been kept open as that
152
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
was the only mantapam available for commencing celebration of festivals and the abhishekam known as Snapana Tirumanjanam. It was however soon realised that this mantapam should be converted into a strong room for keeping the costly articles and jewels of the temple in safety. From a study of the dates of inscriptions now found on its walls (south, east and north walls) it is inferred that when, or just before, the construction of the present Mukha mantapam (or Asthāna mantapam or Tirumamāni Amantapam as it was then called) this Snapana Mantapam was converted into a strong room in the early years of the fifteenth century A.D.1
The doorway in the east wall is now known as Bangāru Väkili (Golden gate). The old circular section pillars in the centre were replaced by those of the square section. The alterations made are shown on the plan which exhibits the original as well as the remodelled condition of the building.
This room would have certainly served as a safe room ever since a new department under the name Por-Bhanḍāram was</li>
<li>This inference is drawn on a reading of the following inscriptions On the cast wall in which is the Bangaru Vakili and to the south of that door way and behind the twin bells, there is an inscription in Tamil dated Wednesday Babula 12. Mina Month Avittam nak of Sarvadhari year (along with a short statement in Grantha Sanskrit) that one Madhava Dasa renewed an old river channel and that from the increased yield thus obtained a daily food offering of one &lsquo;Tiruppōnakan should be made. On the door jamb wall of the Bangaru Vakili itself is an inscription in Kanarese script dated Monday sukla dasami, Ma gasira month of Saumya year. saka 1351 which records a magnificent endowment made by Sri Maharajadhiraja Raja Paran eswara Sri Viapratapa Devaraya Maharaya, the Vijayanagar Emperor. Another inscription in Sanskrit (Grantha) on the north wall records the gift of a gold pattam (Kireetam) to Sri Venkatesw: ra by Sirigiresvara, the son of Vissanna Devaraya on Satu day, Sukla Dasami of Ashodha me nth in the year Sadharana,saka 1352 As against the above there is an inscription on the wall of the record room near the Yagasala which states tl at the Tirumamani mantapam was completed by Mallanna (Madhv Dasa, in the year 1417. The inferere therefore is that the walls around the Sn ipana Mantapam are of dates later than 1430.

created about the end of the fifteenth century. From an article appearing in the Asiatic Journal for 1831 A.D. it appears as if the &lsquo;gangalam&rsquo; and &lsquo;koppara&rsquo; into which votive offerings are deposited by the pilgrims were kept in this room in direct view of Sri Venka-
teswara.
The Tirumamani Mantapam.
This is the open mantapam or pavilion standing on 16 stone pillars. It is now called Mukha Mantapam and serves the purpose of an Asthāna Mantapani also. It measures about 43 feet by 40 feet and is divided by the pillars into three aisles. At the eastern end of the central aisle is the shrine of Garuda. The Dvarapalas (or Divine gate keepers) are on either side of the Bangāru Väkili at the western end of this aisle. While the side aisles are being used for other purposes the central one is left unoccupied and is used for certain daily and other functions and for distinguished pilgrims to stand or rest for a while. It is in this portion and in front of the door way that early in the morning every day Bhaktas recite and sing songs called Suprabhatam in praise of the Lord as if to wake Him up from sleep. This is done during the interval taken by the archakas etc., to transfer Bhoga Srinivasa from the swing cot on which He was reposing to His place in the Garbhagriham, to trim the lights, etc. It is in the central quadrangle of this mantapam that the idol known as Koluvu Srinivasa (the Bali Beram) holds His durbar after the morning puja known as Tomala seva of Sri Venkateswara is finished; the day&rsquo;s panchangam or calendrical details are read, the daily rice ration called Matradanam is given over to the archaka and a preparation of fried gingelly seeds, powdered dry ginger and country sugar is offered to the Deity and distributed to those assembled. On the afternoon of the commencement of the annual Brahmotsavam, the &lsquo;utsava murti&rsquo; Sri Malayappan with the two Nächchimars are decorated and seated here in a Tiruchchi. Those who have made the prescribed payment for the celebration of the Brahmotsavam are invested on the wrist of the right hand with the Kankanam (the saffron coloured string) in the usual ritualistic manner and receive the silver wand which they later carry in procession with the Deity.
154
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
In the old days when there was no Kalyana Mantapam, the Utsava Murti was accommodated here night and day for a long period, from the day of commencement of the festival to the day of celebration of the Dipavali festival. The same was done for about 22 or 23 days during the Adhyayanōtsavam in the month of Margali. On the night of Sri Jayanti, the Abhishekam for Sri Krishna takes place in the central quadrangle and simultaneously an abhishekam and twelve aradhanams (Dvadasa aradhanam) are done for Ugra Srinivasa (or Venkatatturaivar) at the eastern end near Garuḍālvar&rsquo;s shrine. The latter is an anomalous apology for the Dvadasārādhanam (12 aradhanams) which He should have received on the tenth day of the annual festival. This mantapam (its central aisle) is also used for heaping on the floor an enormous quantity of cooked rice and condiments so that Bhoga Srinivasa Murti might be brought over to the Bangaru Vakili for accepting the food offering called Tiruppavadai. The poor from the adjoining villages gather by previous intimation and take away all that food. God does the poor feeding off and on in Tirumala. It is a very costly festival. A special abhishekam festival known as Sahasra Kalasabhishekam (1008 vessels of water are consecrated with appropriate rituals) is held in this central aisle. Sri Malayappan with Nachchimar, Bhoga Srinivasa and Vishvaksēna are brought over here for receiving the abhishekam. Devotees pay heavy sums for this. On the night of the Sattumurai of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s twelve days, festival he is given here a grand reception by the Utsava Murti. The reading of the Kausika Puranam and other Puranams take place here in the asthānam. The four principal asthanams or durbars on the occasion of the Yugadi, Anivarai (Dakshinayana Punyakālam), the Dipavali and the Makara sankramanam or Sankranti also take place here. The Anivara asthanam is a particularly impressive function when the drama of observing an old tradition is annually enacted. All the principal officers of the temple (hereditary and otherwise)depo it there the ensignia of office at the feet or Sri Malayappan and are reinvested because they have been found fit to continue in office. It is again in this mantapam that the marriage festival of Sri Venkateswara known as Kalyanotsavam used to be celebrated before the kalyanamantapam was constructed.
155
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
It is in the northern aisle of the mantapam that the daily financial transactions of the temple take place. In its west quadrangle is placed a long gangāļam (large brass vessel) covered with a long canvas spout and guarded by peons. All votive offerings are deposited in this vessel called koppara. They range from hairs removed from the head of men and women to diamond necklaces, earrings, kammals, gold bangles set with precious stones, bundles of currency notes, gold, silver and copper coins of all denominations, current and uncurrent. It is sometimes a moving sight to see ladies removing all the valuable ornaments they wear so dearly and wrap them in a yellow cloth and drop the bundle into this koppara, then worship the koppara, circumambulate it and go away contentedly. Even those who have not taken a vow deposit at least a rupee or some coin into this koppara.
In the next compartment the chief officer of the temple called Parapatyadar is seated in direct view of the koppara. The contents are emptied every afternoon soon after the second bell or naivedyam and the sorting and counting take place openly in the presence of all assembled. This is called parakamani. Some of the respectable visitors are invited to witness the scene and to attest after the counting and sorting is completed and entered in the books by the parapatyadar. Tickets are issued by accountants and shroffs sitting in the next compartment for moneys received for admission to the various arjitham darsans.
At the western end of the southern aisle hang the twin bells which keep ringing with their deafening noise for well nigh an hour when Sri Venkatesa is presumed to be going through the naivedyam or the Divine Dinner of all the food offerings prepared. All the doors of the sanctum remain closed during this interval, the archakas alone having the privilege to remain inside. In other temples a pair of hand bells serve the purpose as perhaps the quantity of food offered is small.
Lastly it is through this mantapam that the poor pilgrim approaches the sanctum in a queue during the short period set apart for Dharma darsanam. The soul of the donor of this mantapam, Mallanna is surely dancing round the mantapam every day

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
in ecstacy while the soul of Samavai has become one with Bhoga Srinivasa in the Garbhagriham itself, another Andal of this yuga.
Sri Narasimha Swami Shrine.
This Deity is known by two other names in our inscriptions, viz., Alagiyasingar (the beautiful lion) and Venkatattari (lion of Venkata). The Shrine was constructed in haste perhaps during the years 1330 to 1360 owing to the fear of desecration of Hindu Idols by the Muslim iconoclasts, and meant either for the Deity in Shōlangipuram or the one in Ahobilam. But it does not appear to have served that purpose. The archakas have a special attachment to Narasimha and Varahaswami as they go to make up the Nava Murtis of their agama. Narasimhaswami is also the patron Deity of the Ahōbila matam, also called the Van Sathagopan Matam. In 1469 A. D.1 Kandadai Rāmānuja Iyyangar made the first endowment for a food offering of one Tiruvõlakkam to this Deity on the Panguni Amavasya and Vasanta Pournami days. This might have been to appease the archakas and bring them round to accept his next move to celebrate Adhyayanotsavam in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s temple in 1476 A.D. In 1493 A.D. one Dattirāja Timmayya of Konakonța who was a disciple of Sri Van Sathagōpa Ji, yar made an endowment for food offerings during the 30 days of Tiruppalli eluchchi and for offering atirasappadi on each of the days of Sri Jayanti, Vasanta Paurnami, Sri Rama Navami and the seventh festival day of each Brahmotsavam of Sri Venkateswara. The food offerings would be made to Sri Venkateswara only in honour of Narasimhaswami. He made over to his acharya the donor&rsquo;s share of the prasādams. Again two of the accountants of the Tirumala Temple made an endowment for food offerings in connection with the reading of the Kaisika Puranam on the Utthana Dvadasi day. There is separate provision in this endowment for food offerings in the name of Sri Narasimhaswami, Ponmeynda perumal (or Varadaraja) and Varahapperumal.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Shrine of Sri Ramanuja in Tirumala.
This Shrine abuts on the north wall of the second prakaram; and the vimana pradakshinam separates it from the Tirumamani mantapam. In size it is about 15&rsquo;x12&rsquo; with a Mukhamantapam 20 ft. long. The Shrine is in fact a portion of the north corridor abutting on the prakaram wall. It could not therefore be assigned a date prior to the construction of the prakaram wall, whcih, as was already discussed, could be assigned to the second quarter of the fifteenth century. Sri Vaishnavas would not however subscribe to the belief that the Shrine was constructed about that time. Certain inscriptions,traditions and considerations arising thereform will be placed before the readers. They may draw their own conolusions.
There are three shrines of Sri Ramanuja; one in Tirupati, one on the way to Tirumala at a place called Mulangal murrippan (or mokalla metlu at the summit of that hill) and the third in the Tirumala temple. Although we are for the moment concerned with the one in the Tirumala temple it is necessary to refer to the shrine in Tirupati also because a near enough date can be assigned for it.
Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Shrine in Tirupati.
An inscription (I-89) on the west and the south bases of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Temple in Tirupati states that in the month of Avani of the Vikrama (cyclic) year ( is wrongly put for in the inscription) the fifteenth regnal year of Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya, certain Sri Vaishnavas made an endowment (dharmam) for the lighting and the supply of flowers for the Emperumânar Shrine. This year corresponds to 1220 A.D. A later inscription in the third regnal year of Sri Ranganatha Yadavaraya shows that the shrine owned some lands which were overgrown with shrubs and that water supply was made available for its cultivation (and reclamation) from the Periya-eri (big tank) in Tirupati.

Shrine in Tirupati shows that it had its own corpus for which onc Yatiraja Jiyyar was the &lsquo;kartar&rsquo; (or manager) and that Udaiyavar Emperumanar&rsquo;s annual festival was being celebrated in the month of Chitra. The endownent was made in connection with that festival by one Annan Tiruvenkaṭayyan. There is a fourth endowment dated 20th October 1475 (inscribed on the east wall of the front mantapam of that shrine by Mudaliyar Sathagopadásar Narasimharāya Mudaliyar (one of the chief Sri Vaishnavas or Mudaliyars of Tirupati) in connection with Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Sattumurai during the Chitra festival. On the 9th of May. 1476 another endowment was made by the same donor in the name of Kandaḍai Ramanuja Ayyangar for offering a daily Tiruppōnakam etc., in the Tirupati Shrine.
Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Shrine in Tirumala.
Sathagopadasar Narasimharayar also made an endowment for food offerings to be made on various other occasions and for different purposes in Tirumala. The inscription relating to this is one of the key inscriptions in the Tirumala Temple. It is placed on the south wall of the second prakaram. It makes provision for offering daily one Tirupponakam to Sri Raghunatha (Sri Rama) in the Tirumala Temple. It is the first time that the existence of this Deity in Tirumala Temple is mentioned. It is also the first time that the shrine of Sri Ramanuja and the celebration of an Adhyayana utsavam in front of his shrine for 12 days in the month of Chittra are mentioned. There is a further provision therein of 11 tiruvolakkam for the celebration of his monthly birth star in the other months of the year. There is also provision for the celebration of the annual birth star (aṭṭai tirunakshatram) of all the 12 Alvars by having their respective works recited in front of Ramanuja&rsquo;s Shrine. The inscription shows that the Non-brahmin Sättäda Sri Vaishnavas also recited the prabandhams along with the Sattina or Brahmin Sri Vaishnavas in front of the Udaiyavar shrine during the 12 day festival for Udaiyavar in the Chittirai month.

was responsible for this innovation. We have shown that there are references to Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine in Tirupati from 1220 A.D. onwards; but for the shrine in Tirumala the earliest one is of the 1476 A.D. The shrine abuts on the prakaram wall which obviously came into existence in the second quarter of the fifteenth century A.D. The inscription does not say that Sathagōpadasar constructed the Tirumala Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine (as he did Raghunatha&rsquo;s temple in Tirupati in 1481).
There is a tradition that the shrines of Sri Ramanuja in Tirumala and Tirupati were constructed more or less simultaneously soon after the death of Sri Ramanuja. The Guruparampara account says that a shrine was constructed in Srirangam (Koil) by Thirukkurukaippiran pillan, the gñanaputra of Sri Ramanuja; that Mudaliyandan (another disciple) constructed the shrine in Sriperumbüdür, the birth place of Sri Ramanuja; that Kidambi Achchan, Nallan and some others constructed a shrine in Tirunarayanapuram and installed Alvārs also there; that Naḍādūr alvar installed Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s idol in Kanchipuram and that Pillai-Tirumala Nambi installed one in Keelai Tirupati, a second at the spot now called Dōvabhashyakar Sannidhi, where Tirumala prasādams of Tiruvengaḍamudaiyān were presented to him on the occasion of his glorious visit and the third in the Sannidhi of Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan. Apart from this tradition and account we know that Anandāļvār and his son were devoted disciples of Sri Ramanuja. The grand-son viz., Anandālvän Venkatatturaivan has left an inscription (which stands as an incomplete one) on the north base of the first gopuram in the Tirumala temple. It reads translated into English. (I. 172.)

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
There are two other inscriptions in a similar incomplete condition which only go to show that Anandālvär Venkatathuraivar took a pledge to carry on the Tirunandavanam (or flower garden) and some other dharmam of Sri Ramanuja. This pledge might have been given to his father when he was in his old age or about to die.
There is nothing in these inscriptions which could be construed as stating that there was a shrine for Sri Ramanuja in Tirumala on that date which may be about 1170 or 1180 A.D.1 Inscription I-172 only shows that &lsquo;amudupadi&rsquo; and &lsquo;sattupadi&rsquo; were meant for some (Deity) in the month of Margali when the inscription was made. It might well have been for Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s Temple for Dhanurmäsa food offering.
The Tirumala Temple in those days had not sufficient resources to carry on the daily Nimandam (puja including food offering) and the Sthanattar represented the matter to Tirukkālattidēva Yadavaraya when he was camping in Avilali near Tirupati in his 19th regnal year (1209 A.D.). He then granted with libations of water all the nanjai and punjai lands situated within the four boundaries of Kudavür together with all taxes, etc., for the nimandam. So at the time Venkatatturaivar made his inscriptions the temple stood in need of &lsquo;amudupadi&rsquo; and &lsquo;sattuppadi.&rsquo; It is therefore reasonable to assume that Sri Ramanuja himself would have asked that &lsquo;amudupadi&rsquo; and &lsquo;sattupadi&rsquo; should be supplied by his disciples</li>

regularly to the Temple of Sri Venkateswara. There was no likelihood of a shrine having been erected for Sri Ramanuja at that time. The tradition however is that his images were installed simultaneously in Tirupati and in Tirumala. In Tirupati there was one in 1220 A.D. (which was after 1209 A.D.). It is therefore not unlikely that a small shrine was built in Tirumala also or at any rate that an idol was installed in the temple. The idol might have been subsequently shifted to the present shrine after it was built some time before 1476 A.D. Since then attention was paid to the maintenance of the shrine. In fact it needs no maintenance. We find that food offerings even when intended for Sri Ramanuja were by stipulation of the donor first offered to Tiruvengadamudaiyan and then brought to the shrine for being offered to Sri Ramanuja. This has always been the procedure in Tirumala. It is inconceivable that a shrine would have been built in Tirupati when there was none in Tirumala.
Other Relevant Considerations.
Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s association with Tirumala was intimate in many ways. His mother (Bhuppirätti) was married to Kesava Somayaji of Sriperumbudur in Tirumala after the latter&rsquo;s conversion to Sri Vaishnavism by Tirumala Nambi. When Yadavaprakasa from whom Ramanuja was receiving his general education in Sanskrit in Kanchipuram declined to give him any further instruction owing to acute differences between the pupil and the teacher in the interpretation of certain debatable texts and when Sri Ramanuja sought his mother&rsquo;s advice as to what he should do next she unhesitatingly advised him to follow the footsteps of his great uncle Tirumala Nambi and carry water from the Sala well in Kanchi for the daily Abhishekam of Sri Varadarajaswami (vt $ LAFON ). It was in Tirumala that Sri Ramanuja learnt from his uncle the several esoteric meanings of Srimad Ramayanam. When in later years he visited Tirupati and Tirumala as the acknowledged leader of all Sri Vaishnavas, his uncle received him with unprecedented temple honours at the spot where stands. the Dōva Bhashyakar Sannidhi on the Mōkalla parvatam or the knee breaker hill. Sri Tirumala Nambi&rsquo;s second son Tiruk-

THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
kurukaippiran Pillän was adopted by Sri Ramanuja as his gäänaputra. We are also aware of the tradition that when Saivites laid claim to the Tirumala temple as being a Saivite one it was Sri Ramanuja who came to Tirumala to establish it as a Vishnu Shrine. In his great work Sri Bhashya, the opening verse is a devout prayer to the Supreme Brahman. He equates therein Brahman with Srinivasa. His prayer in short is that Srinivasa may endow him with knowledge founded on Bhakti and not mere intellectual learning. He emphasises therein the universal tradition that Para Brahman has manifested Himself on the Tirumala Hill as Srinivasa. His association with Tirupati has been equally intimate. He installed and consecrated the idol of Sri Govindarajaswami after the same was cast away from Chidambaram by Külöttunga Chola I. He formed the little village surrounding that temple which was known for a long time as Ramanujapuram. He converted Tirupati into a flourishing little town by making it incumbent on those who wished to serve in Tirumala to become permanent residents of Tirupati.&rsquo;
Knowing so much about all that was done by him for enhancing the fame of Tirumala and Tirupati it would be a surprise to be told that no shrine was dedicated to him in Tirumala when there was one in Tirupati about 1200 A.D. Inscriptions are not the only evidence for this. There are inscriptions in Tirupati because every temple and shrine there was and had necessarily to be provided with an independent corpus for its maintenance. The Temple of Sri Govindaraja, the shrines of Sri Ramanuja and Tirumangai Alvar had each its own funds. Not so in Tirumala. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine would have been from the commencement a part and parcel of Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s pantheon. There could not exist, according to ancient usage and tradition, any other independent shrine, except of course the Shrine of Sri Varahaswami. There could not therefore have been independent puja for any other Deity there. The Alvars have not been installed there, because they do not dovetail into the Vaikhanasa Agama according</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
to which the daily worship of Sri Venkateswara was fashioned from the days of the installation of Bhoga Srinivasa when we hear of a karmarchana for the first time Sri Ramanuja did not consider it desirable, nor would it have been possible for him, to disturb old arrangements to which his own uncle Tirumala Nambi was a party.
There however still remains the question how is it that none of the great bhaktas and the other great men who made endowments ever thought of associating Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s name with some endow. ment or other and how was it that the year 1476 A.D. was singled out for the celebration of a twelve day festival in Chitra month, for his monthly birth star days and for the recitation of the prabandham of the Alvars in his presence during their birth star (or Sattumurai) in Tirumala? The chequered history of prabandham recital during Adhyayanōtsavam in Sri Vaishnava temples, working even on the Pancharatra system, gives the reply. Serious objections were raised by worshippers of Vishnu in general who did not subscribe to the Sri Vaishnava doctrines as promulgated by Alavandär and Ramanuja to the recital of Tamil songs in a temple where worship was being carried on according to rituals prescribed in the Agama based on Vedic texts in Sanskrit. The use of Tamil verses at any stage within the holy precincts of the temple was considered an act of pollution. Sri Vedanta Desika is said to have exposed the hollowness of the objections in his Satadushani No. (65) which is said to have been composed before the invasion of the south by Malik Kafur. There was subsequently confusion caused by the Muslim invasion and Sri Ranganatha was removed from Srirangam to Tirumala. Until all the confusion came to an end and Sri Ranganatha was taken back to Srirangam, (after a brief stay in Senji) by the Vijayanagar commander Gopanna all festivals were suspended. When shortly after 1348 A.D. the Adhyayanotsavam was resumed, the same objections were again raised and Sri Vedanta Desika had again to meet these objections in an assembly specially convened by Gopanna. These difficulties arose in the biggest Pancharatra temple at Srirangam where the recital of the Alvårs&rsquo; Prabandhams was in vogue before. In Tirumala the objections to the recital of these songs would have been
164
THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE-THE SANCTUM
all the stronger as the Vaikhanasa Agama does not recognise any other mantrams or slokams than those contained in the Sanskrit Agama. Nor do they recognise the Alvars as saints with the spark of divinity in them. Even Sri Ramanuja did not unsettle the Vaikhanasa form of worship in vogue. His uncle Tirumala Nambi contented himself with bringing water from Akasaganga for the abhishekam and puja and with performing the mantrapushpam by reciting the riks, etc., and offering Tulasi. According to the Vaikhanasa agama even this is the prescriptive right of the archaka. It is seen from our inscriptions that until the year 1360 A.D. the prabandham was not recited in any part of Tirumala. In that year the first attempt was made in front of the main Gōpuram (Periya Tiruvasal or outside the temple) by reciting the Tiruvoimoli of Nammalvar during the Brahmotsavam before the Deity was taken back into the temple. The recital was not within the temple. Sri Vaishnavas who had witnessed the grandeur of the recital of the prabandhams in the Pancharatra temples of the south set their heart on initiating it in the Tirumala Temple. The first attempt was therefore made in the Udaiyavar Emperumanar shrine in Tirupati in the year 1475 A.D. or a short time before that. In that year two endowments were made, one by Annan Tiruvenkatayyan on 9-7-1475 and the other by Sathagōpa dasar Narasimharaya Mudaliar on .20-10-1475 for food offerings in connection with a twelve day festival for Udaiyavar Emperumanar in Tirupati ending with Sattumurai on the day of his birth star Arudra in the Chitra month. The inscriptions do not state in clear terms that the prabandhams of the Alvars were sung at the time. This attempt was extended to Tirumala in 1476 A. D. The non-brahmins were associated with the brahmins in the recital of the prabandhams in front of the shrine of Sri Ramanuja. The dissenters if any would have been the Vaikhanasa archakas and other Vaishnavas who did not profess the Sri Vaishnava cult. As there were other items in the endowment such as a daily food offering for Sri Raghunatha etc., and as the recital did not take place in the presence of Sri Venkatesa, the attempt proved successful. Further, just about that time, the Vaikhanasa archakas were under a cloud as one of their folk was guilty of embezzlement of temple jewels, etc. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine and festival offered the most
165
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
convenient venue for the attempt to introduce the Tamil prabandham into the temple. In this all Sri Vaishnavas joined. Sri Vedanta Desika had established beyond a shadow of doubt that the Prabandhams were as sacred as the Sanskrit Upanishads and he had published his tract called &ldquo;Dramidopanishad-săram&rdquo;. But for this earnest desire of the Sri Vaishnavas for prabandham recital Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine might have continued its quiescent existence in Tirumala. After 1500 A. D. we notice a greater recognition of Sri Ramanuja and also the Deity known as Sri Raghunatha in Tirumala.
It may incidentally be stated that there is a general impression that Ramanujakūtam (a place where the offered prasadam is freely distributed to pilgrims) is an institution, or practice which owes its origin to Sri Ramanuja. There is no authority for this. The first time we hear of a Ramanujakutam is in the year 1450 A.D. in an inscription recording an endowment made by one Chennakesavadāsar for making daily one food offering to Vira Narasingapperumal in Tirupati. The donor&rsquo;s share was given away to those residing in the Ramanujakūtam which was his creation. (தம்முடைய தர்மமான ஸ்ரீனிவாஸ புரத்தில் இராமானுஜ கூடத்தில் இருக்கிறபேர் பெற்று போதக் கடவராகவும்).

SRI VARAHASWAMI TEMPLE, TIRUMALA.
The Temple of Sri Varahaswami is on the west bank and at the northwest corner of the Swami Pushkarini in Tirumala, There is a tradition that Sri Varahaswami, also known as Gñānappiran, was the oldest Deity in Tirumala. Although there are no inscriptions to confirm the existence of this temple before the year 1380 A.D. it is generally believed that Sri Varahaswami was the original Deity presiding over the Tirumala Hill. According to Hindu mythology we are now (of time), in the eighth sub-division of what is called Vaivasvathamanvantaram of Svēta Varaha Kalpam and in Kaliyuga. Mythology also tells us that all the Vedas and Vedangas revealed by God Himself go into hiding or oblivion on the occurrence of a Mahāpralaya, when all manifested creation is dissolved and absorbed into Him. There is then nothing but an ocean of tamas or darkness. It is in this ocean that the Vedas lie hidden. After another creation takes place God in His avatar as Sri Varaha rescues and restores to us the eternal but hidden Vedas. This is probably the reason why Sri Varahaswami is regarded as the oldest God on the Tirumala Hill. Mythologically Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan&rsquo;s manifestation on the Hill was only at the beginning of the Kali Yuga of Vaivasvatamanvantara of the Sveta Varahakalpa. His Archavatara then usurped the seat which Adi-Varaha was occupying.
There is also another apsect to be considered. According to the Bhriguvalli of the Taittiriya Upanishad the Embodied Soul passes through five stages in its spiritual evolution-Annamaya, Prana maya, Manomaya, Vigñanamaya and the Anandamaya kōsams. The pilgrim to Tirumala approaches the Hill with his Annamaya kosa. After a bath in the waters of the Alvar Tirtham which is presumed to issue from the right toe of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan and with faith in the teachings of Sri Nammāļvār whose shrine is near that Tirtham he enters upon the Pranamaya stage in his ascent of the Hill. When he reaches the knee-breaking ascent he changes into the Manōmaya kosa, a period of serious searchings of the heart and the mind. Sri Ramanuja (whose shrine is there)
167
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
is supposed to help him with his metaphysics of the real relationship between Prakrith, Jivatma and Paramatma. After reaching the Hill top and bathing in the Swami Pushkarini, which is supposed to possess the virtues of all sacred waters, he gets inspiration from Gñanappiran (Sri Varaha) and true knowledge or the Vigñanamaya kosa. The final stage is reached when he worships Tiruvengadamudaiyan in His Ananda Nilaya Vimanam. So worship of Sri Varahaswami (Vignanamaya stage) should precede worship of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan with the Anandamaya kosam. This perhaps is also what is meant when it is stated that Tiruvengadamudaiyan usurped Varahaswami residence. When Anandam takes possession of the soul there is no further need for Vigñānam as such. This is perhaps the reason for the injunction that one must first worship Sri Varahaswami or Gnanappiran before attempting to worship Sri Venkatesa. None of the Alvārs however has composed verses in praise of that shrine in Tirumala.
Tirumala is called Varaha Kshetram. Those living around Tirupati while doing Sankalpam for all ceremonials recite &quot; Varaha Kshetre, Ananda Vimana chchāyāyām&rdquo; to define the position of the place in space. But the place is not called Varaha Kshetram in any of the inscriptions nor by any of the Alvārs.
The metaphysical relationship between Gñanappiran (Varahaswami) and Sri Venkateswara is demonstrated every day in the procedure adopted for offering Naivedyam. A quantity of the food prepared in the kitchen of Sri Venkateswara is sent to Sri Varahaswami Temple. It is only when the bell in the latter temple strikes to signify that the prasadam has reached that temple and is ready for offering, that the bells in Sri Venkatesa&rsquo;s temple begin to ring and the Naivedyam takes place simultaneously in the two temples. The Avatara Nakshatram of both the Deities is Sravanam (Onam) sacred to Vishnu.
The existence of a temple for Sri Varahaswami comes to notice only in 1380 A.D. In that year one Alagappiranar Tirukkalikanri dasar, the foremost Sri Vaishnava resident of Tirupati, made an endowment (I. 184. 31-1-1380) of 400 panams and from the interest thereon a tiruvõlakkam food offering was made every year
168
SRI VARAHASWAMI TEMPLE, TIRUMALA
for Malaikuniyaninraperumal on the second day of each of the Brahmostavams and also one kurini of cooked rice for each of the Deities, Periya Perumal and Sri Varaha Nayanar. The next reference is 96 years later, i.e., in 1476 A. D. in an endowment (II. 68 2-3-1476) made by Sri Sathakopa dasar Narasimharaya Mudaliar, of 5200 panams making provision for a series of food offerings to Malaikuniyaninraperumal on festival occasions. One of these items is the offering of one Sukhiyan padi,while Malaikuniya ninra Permumal is seated in a flower mantapam (Tiruppumantapam) in the temple of Gnanappiran, (Sri Varahaswami) on the bank of the Swamipushkarini on the sixth festival day of each of the Brahmotsavams. This is not an offering intended for Sri Varahaswami. It is worth noting that in 1380 A.D. the Deity was called Varaha Nayinar whereas in 1476 He is named Gñanappiran which became the more popular name.
Although the temple came to notice only in 1380 and the next mention thereof was made in 1476, it will be seen from the account of endowments made since then that this temple maintained its hold on the devotees since then till now. There are however a few persons who seem to think that a temple was constructed for the Boar God with view to making the Muslims detest the Hill as the God there was represented to them as Suvar Allah.
The next reference is to an endowment (II. 76. 7-7-1481) for offering daily 2 tirupponakam to Adi Varahapperumal and 4 tirupponakam to Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan. This was made by Saluva Timmaraya, son of Saluva Mallayadeva Maharaya. Another reference is to an endowment (III. 132, 133) made by Sri Kandadai Vedantacharya Dodḍappayyangar on 13-4-1519 for offering 40 atirasappadi during the 8 Brahmotsavams, when the Utsava Murti (Malaikuniyaninra perumal) hears Tirumoli in the shrine of Gñanappiran.</li>

In the Tasdik prepared by the East India Company about 1819 A.D. Sri Varahaswami Temple was classed as a minor temple. It received no contribution from the circar, but depended entirely on Kānukas paid by pilgrims, on ubhayams and on contribution made by the dharmakartas of the temple. Its average income and. expenditure was about Rs. 250/a year (79 puļļi varāhas 12 maili and 65 käsus).
padi on the day of his father&rsquo;s annual birth star. The donor was an archaka and as such the dharmakarta of Sri Varahaswami temple. We have elsewhere noticed that a large part of the funds which constituted this endowment represented the payment made to him by Achyutaraya Maharaya on the occasion when he himself performed the archana to Sri Venkateswara and the archaka recited only the 1008 names.

One of the items of an endowment (IV-157. 13-2-1541 of 2770 panam) by Settalur Srinivasayyan was the offering of one dosaipadi to Sri Varahaswami on the day of his annual birth star (Arpisi Sravanam)

Again one Ellappa Pillai made an endowment (IV-165, 3-8-1541) for conducting Mukkoti Dvadasi festival for 3 days commencing from Dasami. On the Tirthavari day (or dvadasi) he provided for offering 9 Tirupponakam when Malaikuniya ninra Perumal was seated in the shrine of Sri Varahaswami in the early morning of that day.
Kuppa Venkattarasu (one of the accountants) made an endowment (V-5-2-1543) of 1282 panam for the merit of his mother. The amount was to be utilised for offering of 4 tirapponakam on each Mukkoti Dvadasi day to Gianappiran when Tiruvali-alvan (Sri Sudarsana) was bathing in the sacred waters of Swamipushkarani. For the same occasion but after Tiruvali alvan&rsquo;s bath in the tank and when Malaikuniya ninran, Nachchimar and and Tiruvali Alvan are seated in the front mantapam of Gñanappiran&rsquo;s temple, Ellappa Pillai made an endowment for offering one nayaka taligai For the same Tirudvadasi day Kuppa Venkatattarasu made an endowment (V. 8. 5-10-1543) for offering 6 tirupponakam to Sri Varahaswami.

SRI VARAHASWAMI TEMPLE TIRUMALA
There need be no doubt about Varahaswami Temple being an ancient one in Tirumala. Its late recognition in inscription may be explained in a manner. The temple has always been the sole concern of the archakas, who were archakas for both the temples. It might have continued to be a temple unnoticed in inscriptions made by the Sthanattar of Sri Venkatesvara&rsquo;s Temple but for two innovations which the Sri Vaishnavas and the Sthanattar were anxious to effect, and in which the Vaikhanasa had to be made to acquiesce. These were the admission of Malaikuniya ninra Perumal and Nachchimar into the sanctum and the recital of the Prabandhams of the Alvars without a protest from the archakas. It was already pointed out that Malaikuniya ninra perumal got admission about 1339 A.D. and the recital of Tiruvaimoli in front of the (Gopura vasal) main gate of the temple took place in 1360 A.D. We consequently find that Alagappiranar Tirukkalikanri dasar (one of the Sthanattar) included Sri Varaha Nayanar in his endowment for food offering in 1380 A.D.
Sottai Tirumala Nambi Srinivasayyengar provided for offerings one appapadi to Sri Varahaswami on the second day of the Adhyayanotsavam in Tirumala in Margali month.
Rajasri Sivaraya Ramachandra Yadamatara Dabirsa in an endowment (VI. 24, 19-3-1634) for daily food offerings to Sri Venkatesa made provision for offering daily to Sri Varahaswami one taligai prasdam and one pot (gün) of payasam.

PART (4)
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
THE Murti Swarupam of Sri Venkateswara, and the complementary metallic idols (or Berams); and the Utsava or processional idols of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna which make up the Pantheon of Tirumala.
Around the Murti of Sri Venkateswara have gathered all the other idols mentioned above. The main Murti is apparently a stone image; but we cannot be too sure about it. The tradition is that it is not an image wrought by the hand of man and that God manifested Himself in a form which man could comprehend, being similar to his own. The material from which this form is shaped is seemingly lifeless matter. But we Hindus fully believe that It is full of divine life. We worship not only this idol but similar or nearly similar ones installed in other temples. Not being content with this we get small metallic idols manufactured in gold, silver or copper, worship them at home and leave them as precious legacy to our legal heirs. It is not stone or tree worship, nor even nature worship. It is said to have Divine sanction. Divine sanction for the Archa Avatar (or Idol) worship has a mythological backing. The erection of temples and the installation of ancillary and complementary images are also copies of a mythlogical pattern held out to us in the traditional account of creation and dissolution of all mundane (prākrit) matter and its innumerable forms, shapes and activities.
In this chapter some idea will be conveyed of such matters and more particularly about identifying Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s Image with the Supreme Being and the rationale of idol worship in general. In all matters which we could not verify by direct observation or by reasoning with the aid of our limited senses, we place implicit

faith in what the Sastras and Puranas say and in the observations and sayings of great seers and Acharyas.
Divine origin of Sri Venkateswara Murti and divine sanction for the archa form of worship.
In the Yugas preceding the advent of our Kaliyuga the method adopted for God realisation was the practice of penance, mental concentration and meditation, known as Yoga Marga. This has its own intermediate pitfalls brought about by the acquisition of undreamt of psychic powers and the consequent temptation to imagine oneself as being co-equal with God1. Our Mythology. Itihasas and Puranas abound with stories to illustrate these pit falls. The yearning to achieve God realisation by easier means has always been there in the human breast. The Divine Will gave a response to this desire at the end of the Dvapara Yuga which just preceded our Yuga.
As Adharma or evil was stalking the earth in the later period of that Yuga, the Supreme Being of His own free will appeared on earth as a Man (Sri Krishna) and in a human manner brought about a colossal war which wiped out the evil elements which then threatened to destroy the human soul. Having done this Sri Krishna designed the manner of his terminating that Avatar of His in an equally natural manner. In the Treta Yuga (preceding the Dvapara Yuga) the Supreme Being had come on earth as Sri Rama to destroy evil. One of the incidents of that Avatar was his shooting with a deadly arrow Väli, the great king of the monkey race. He committed this act by hiding himself behind seven Sal trees because</li>

The import of the Stanza is that &ldquo;with the exception of those Yogis who while realising the Brahman within the self dare to come to the exclusion that they are one with or co-equal to Him, all others consider it the right thing to do when they deeply meditate, sing praises and and dance in ecstasy&rdquo;.
173
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Vali&rsquo;s psychic powers were such that he drew into himself all the powers of an enemy who faced him. Before his death he accused Sri Rama of having acted in a cowardly fashion and of being an unworthy son of the great Dasaratha. Väli was in the eye of God entitled to a quid pro quo. So Vali was given another birth as a hunter by name Jara. Sri Krishna having accomplished His selfimposed task on earth and desiring to cast off the material body went into a Yoga trance resting His body on the ground in a thick forest, with the right foot placed on the left knee. Jara came that way in search of game and mistook Sri Krishna for a beast of prey. Instantly he shot a deadly arrow shod with a piece of steel which was the remanent left after fulfilling a curse made by the Rishi Dhurvasa for the destruction of the Yadava race. Sri Krishna was the last great figure of that race left and so offered himself for that piece of steel. Jara found that he committed a huge blunder and incurred a great sin in having killed a man. That man appeared to him as being unique with four hands. He fell prostrate and caught hold of the feet of Sri Krishna begging pardon. He was not only pardoned but freed from any future birth. The above portion of the story is only a prelude to the setting in which divine sanction was given to Idol worship.
Divine Sanction for Idol worship
Rishis, Munis, Devas and others headed by Brahma (the creator) gathered on that spot and praised Sri Krishna for having rid the earth of all evil elements. But they regretted very much that by the termination of that Avatar they were losing touch with Divinity and they being only mortals could not hope to see Him in His abode the Divyalōkam or Sri Vaikuntam. The Divine Spirit on whose breast Sri Devi was seen seated was worshipped by all with flowers. The Devas addressed Him as one who wielded the Divine bow Särngam; perhaps because they saw in Him Sri Rāma as well. The Spirit ascended the Heavens illuminating the earth and the Heavens. As it entered the Süryamandalam (the Sun&rsquo;s disc), it took a shape and form with four hands but made of lifeless stable matter. Simultaneously a voice from the Heavens (asariri väkku) exhorted the Devas and the others to behold that
174
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
form which was to descend, or had already descended, on earth where He would dwell for ever and which form they should worship This incident is taken to be the divine sanction for the worship of Idols Srimad Vedanta Desika in his Tamil tract known as &ldquo;Srimad Tatva Mātrukai&rdquo; quotes Sri Bhagavan&rsquo;s own words then uttered as given in Sri Maha Bhāratam (Chapter V. Mausala Parvam). &ldquo;Bhūmau gatam pūjayatām pramēyam.&rdquo; It was a direction given to Brahma, the Devās, Munis and others in response to their request, so that by doing puja and other acts of service for that form they might obtain Salvation. This sanction has been extended by our acharyas to images manufactured and consecrated by mortals, namely the Devas, Risis and great men. Sages subsequently framed rules for standardising the size and proportion of idols, the material of which they should be made, the erection of temple structures and the procedure for consecration of these idols. This was done because indiscriminate and chaotic form of worship will not eventually prove beneficial. The form of the temple, the deities to be installed, their appropriate places and the manner and time of worship are the subjects dealt with in the Agama Samhitas. There are two Agamas which deal with worship of Vishnu, the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra. Each claims greater antiquity and higher sanction for itself. But so far as Tirumala is concerned, neither of these Agamas could lay claim to have manufactured or installed the Mürti as the belief is that It is Self-manifest Brahman. As some form of ritualistic worship had to be adopted the Vaikhanasa form was adopted in course of time. For a long time however, there appears to have been no regular or standard form of worship.
·
Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s Image is self manifest Brahman or Svayam Vyakta Murti.
We have Sri Bhagavan&rsquo;s own statement in Sri Maha Bharatam that He has manifested Himself on earth to make it easy for men to do puja and render such other services as would satisfy their desire to keep close touch with the Divine form. Those who have faith in the Itihasam would have faith in this episode mentioned therein, unless it is argued that the narrative or portions of it are
175
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
later interpolations by interested persons. Such an objection has not yet been raised.
We next have Sri Nammāļvār&rsquo;s assurance that &ldquo;Paran&rdquo; has come down to Tirumala from His Divyalõkam for our spiritual benefit, not at the request or in answer to the prayers of any one, but of His own choice. He illustrates God&rsquo;s solicitude for our spiritual salvation by giving two instances, viz., the manner in which He held up a hill to protect dumb cattle left to His care from the threat of danger to life caused by heavy pelting rains and biting cold, and the odd and unsolicited manner in which He saved the soul of Maha Bali. He tells us that the devas headed by Brahma himself daily worship Sri Venkateswara on this hill just as we do. Again Sri Ramanuja in the Mangala Slokam of his great work &ldquo;Sri Bhashya&rdquo; while enunciating concisely and yet comprehensively the nature and functions of the Supreme Being, lays stress on His great solicitude for the salvation of mankind (Rakshaika diksha). He equates that Brahman with Srinivasa (Sri Venkateswara). So we believe that Sri Venkateswara is selfmanifest Brahman come to Tirumala for our salvation.
It will now be shown that the Mürti was not wrought by human hands.
The Murti (Sri Venkateswara) not a man-made one.
Images manufactured by men for purposes of worship are usually made of stone, clay, wood or some metal. A temple (or mantapam) is built and the Murti consecrated therein according to rituals prescribed in one or the other of the Agamas. The Agamas have prescribed in detail rules for the relative proportions of the idol, the posture of the body, the hands etc., and the weapons borne by it as also the jewellery carved on its body. If there be any defect in the execution, or any variation from the prescribed rules that image would be considered unsuitable for consecration and therefore rejected and even destroyed. We will examine the image of Sri Venkateswara in the light of the rules given in the Agamas for the manufacture of an idol of that type.</li>
<li>All the earlier Alvars have stated likewise.
176
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
Types of Dhruva Murtis prescribed in the Agamas.
The broad classification is into three main types. The standing, the sitting and the reposing or lying posture. Each of these is again divided into four classes depending on the physical and menial attitude of the Idol. They are Yogam, Bhōgam, Viram and Abhichārikam. The environments and the purpose for which a Mürti is installed decide the kind of Idol. A Yoga Mürti would be selected if the worshippers prefer to follow Yoga Marga. Such a Murti should be installed outside a village. in the midst of forests, on mountain and hill tops, at the confluence of rivers and on river banks. It should not be in the heart of a town or village as the Murti would bring about destruction of the place. A Bhōga Mürti should invariably be installed in the heart of a town or village. A Vira Mürti should be on the outskirts of a village. An Abhichārika Murti would be installed in forests, mountains, fortresses, at the outer limits of a Rashtra and facing the enemy country. The Tirumalai temple is on a hill and in the midst of forests. It does not appear that at any time there was a fortress, or a village there. It might prehaps have been politically the boundary line between one country and another. The kind of image chosen would therefore be either Yoga or Abhichārika, not even Vira. Bhoga would be out of consideration.
The features of the Murti for each situation and type are also prescribed in the Agamas. There are three grades of temples depending on the complementary deities. These are called Utthama, Madhyama and Adhama(Best, middling and low or mean type). In the Utthama temple the Murti would be associated with the complementary deities. Brahma, Sankara, Markandeya, Bhrigu, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara, etc.&quot; In the Madhyama type Markandeya etc., would be omitted but Brahma and Siva retained. In the lowest type Brahma and Siva also would be omitted, leaving the Murti to stand alone. The above rule governs the installation of Yoga, Bhoga and Vira Murtis alike. In the case of an Abhichārika Murti,however, there is only one type, the Adhama type and therefore, the principal Murti alone would be installed. Further, in the former types the temple would have Vimanams and the consecration would be on an auspicious day in
123
177
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Sthira Lagna (at any rate not in a chara lagna). For the Abhichārika Mürti the installation should be at an inauspicious moment and in Chara Lagna. The temple should not have a Vimanam.
The features of the Murtis are also prescribed in the Agamas. Before considering the features we might as well see under which type the image of Sri Venkateswara should be classed presuming that it was the handiwork of man. Being on a hill and in a forest where there was no village or fortress in the earliest days, it should be a standing Yoga Adhama, a Standing Abhicharika or perhaps Standing Vira Adhama Murti. It is not likely to have been a Bhōga Murti in those days. Since Sri Venkateswara has always been the only Murti in the temple, the temple is an Adhama one. A standing Yoga murti of the Adhama type should have four hands, the two upper hands should be invested with Chakram and Sankham; the right lower hand should be in Abhaya posture while the left lower hand should assume the Katyavalambita posture or holding on to the loin. The presence of Sri Devi on the chest is not mentioned in the specification. But Sri Devi is on the right breast as an integral part of the image of Sri Venkateswara and not one subsequently invested or detachable. The lower right hand is (giving boons) Varada hastam and not Abhaya. The Sankham and Chakram on the two upper arms are detachable and not integral with the Image. The image could therefore not be taken for a Yoga Murti.
A standing Abhichārika Mürti might have two or four hands, but without any of the divine weapons. The posture of the hands is not mentioned in the specification. So we might place Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s image under this type but for other disabilities. The Abhichārika Murti should have a shrunken chin, lean &lsquo;angas&rsquo; (hands, legs, body should be lean). It should have upturned eyes exhibiting famogunam (evil intentions). The Image of Sri Venkateswara is however a lovely figure having well formed and plumpy angas&rsquo; and decorated with all the divine ornaments associated with the description of Para Vasudeva. Sri Devi is an integral part of the image. The Image could not therefore be classed as Standing Abhicharika.

MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
Nor does it answer to the Vira type, because the Vira type should have Sankha and Chakra permanently. Sri Devi is not mentioned as part of the image. The posture for the lower arms is not given in the specification.
If we wish to examine for the Bhoga type also as a last attempt, the Sankham and Chakram should be permanent fixtures, Sri Devi and Bhu Devi should both be permanently on the breast. The posture of the right lower arm in the Varada Hasta position is the only satisfactory element. The lower left hand should be in the Katyavalambita Simba Karna posture which is not seen in the Image of Sri Venkateswara. The result of the examination is that the Image of Sri Venkateswara does not fall under any one of the types which the Agamas prescribe for installing a Dhruva Murti. If the Image had been one wrought by man, it should therefore have been done in an age when the Agamas had not been compiled.
The only description which we have not considered is that usually given of Para Brahman or Para Vasudeva in the Heavens. Different Samhitas describe Him differently in His Divyalokam. A short one given in Bhrigu Samhita (33rd Adhyaya) shows that He has four hands, is invested with the five weapons or ayudhas; the two halves of His body are symmetrical and beautifully shaped, that he wears all the divya abharanas (jewellery), that Sri Devi ever abides in His Form and that He is full of all the Kalyana gunas and wanting in none and that He shines with His six gunas (Shaḍguna). This description is not a detailed one. The weapons (divya ayudhas)are not in Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s hands. The mention of the Shadgunas is worth noting. We will refer to it later. The Pancharatra Agamas describe Para Vasudeva in different terms, mostly as being seated on Ananta, the Divine Serpent. They are all out of place for our purpose.
In the seventh chapter, sixth amsa of Vishnupuranam there is a description given of the Murta Rupam of Vishnu for purposes of meditation. Four stages of meditation are mentioned. In the lowest the Murti is meditated upon as having all the weapons, all the bhushaṇams (ornaments) and with eight or four hands. In the next higher stage the meditation is upon the Mürti, dropping
179
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
out the divine weapons; in the next higher even the bhushanams or ornaments are also left out. In the next higher only the principal &lsquo;angas&rsquo; such as body, two hands etc., are presumed to be seen. This description states that the Mürti has a &lsquo;Prasanna&rsquo; (spotless and brilliant) face, beautiful eyes shaped like the petal of the lotus flower, beautiful temples, broad fore-head, Kundalams (ear ornaments hanging down the even earlobes, the kantham (or neck) shaped like the right-handed Sankham (Chank), broad chest with Sri Devi seated on the Srivatsa marks, Udara (or belly) in three folds as it were and a deep seated navel, long hands eight or four in number, well knit and symmetrically shaped thighs, spotless pitambara clothing, with ornaments such as Kireetam (crown), Haram (necklace) Kēyūram (shoulder ornaments), Katakam etc., rings on the fingers and toes. The ayudhams (weapons in his hands) are Sarngam (bow), Sankham (conch), Gadä (mace), Khagdam (sword), Chakram (disc). Akshamālā (garland of beads) is in the sixth hand; of the remaining two hands one is in the Abhaya posture and the other in Varada posture. When only four hands are meditated upon Sankham, Chakram, Gada and the lotus flower adorn them. The above description in full is of the form for the lowest stage of meditation. This description does not apply to the form of Sri Venkateswara. In the next higher stage all the weapons are left out and the four hands would therefore be free. All the bhushanams or ornaments however remain on the Murti. This description would apply to the Murti form of Sri Venkateswara in a general way. The lower hands have however a definite posture, the right Varada and the left Katyavalambita and corresponds to a Murti for meditation in the second stage.
As the Murti form of Sri Venkateswara does not answer to the specifications given in the Agamas, the Image should be taken to belong to an earlier age than that of the Agamas. Besides the description given in the Vishnupuranam, what are given in other places also have to be taken into account. Soon after His birth Sri Krishna appeared before his father Vasudeva in His real form. This form is described in Vyasa&rsquo;s Sri Bhagavatham in the Slokam
180
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
commencing with &ldquo;Tam adbhutam balakam ambujekshanam.1&rdquo; Therein He had four hands holding Sankha and the other Ayudhams there were the Srivatsam marks and Kaustubham; He wore pitămbaram, He wore a brilliant kireetam set with diamonds, kundalam etc., he wore gold waist band and other ornaments. It is the same Sri Krishna whose Divine spirit appeared in Suryamandalam and he was then addressed by the Devas as the one who bore the bow Sarngam. If the same apparition did descend on earth on the Tirumala hill as Sri Venkatesa, we would expect to find on the form of the Murti some traces to connect the one with the other. The Devas saw the figure in the Sun&rsquo;s disc from a long distance and it would not have been possible to notice any ornaments on the figure, even if they existed. But the absence of weapons was noticed, although before the spirit entered the Sun&rsquo;s disc the bow was distinctly seen by them. We learn from the description given in Silappadikaram that the bow was on the Murti along with Sankham and Chakram and all the three would have been detachable ones put on the figure.1 There are, however on the form of Sri Venkateswara marks on both shoulders running down from the ends of the collar bones in the direction of the arm-pit resembling scars made by the constant wearing of the bow and the pack of arrows. This scar may be taken to connect the Murti with the avatar of Sri Rama. The connection with Krishna avatar is told in the story itself. That this connection was implicitly believed in ancient days is indicated by the presence of the Utava images of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna in the Sanctum Sanctorum itself. It is worth stating that during the Margasira month the Utsava image of Sri Krishna acts as the Sayana Beram instead of Bhoga Srinivasa who does so during the other eleven months of the year. The preference given to Sri Krishna during that sacred month might be to connote the connection between the Avatars of Sri Krishna and Sri Venkateswara. The arrange-

<li>Sii Nammalvar also stated that there is Srivatsam and Sri Devi (திருமறு and அலர்மேல் மங்கை திருமார்பன) and that Sarpgam was in his hand. This will be dealt with at length in the Chapter on Temples worship Alvar, See Tiruvoimoli (3, 4-3) and (6-10 4, 5, 10).
181HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
ment of the Riks and Slokas of the Mantrapushpam recited during the daily puja helps to remind us that this Archavatar has a direct connection with those of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna. The order of recitation is (1) the opening &lsquo;rik&rsquo; of each of the four Vedas (2) the Ashtaksharam from the Narayanopanishad (3) reference to the avatar of Sri Rama (4) reference to Sri Krishna avatar and the Mahabharata war (5) Sri Krishna revealing his true form to his father (6) Narayana in His Vaikunta lõka (7) all creation is the form and abode of Vishnu (8) Vishnu&rsquo;s advent from Vaikuntam to Tiruvengadam, (9) one of the Nammalvar&rsquo;s songs because he has assured us that Narayana has come over here (10) a sloka each from Sri Alavandar and Sri Ramanuja who have likewise assured us that Srinivasa and Narayana are identically one. This form of Mantrapushpam is peculiar to the daily worship in Tirumala and was obviously composed by Sri Tirumala Nambi. It is very different from what the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharathra ägamas give. It is also different from what Sri Ramanuja has prescribed as a pattern in his &ldquo;Nityam.&rdquo; The only two avatars of Vishnu included in our Mantrapushpam are those of Rama and Krishna. Processional idols representing these two avatars only are included in the Garbha griham. From the earliest times the belief seems to have been that Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s image is Self-manifest (Svyaam Vyaktam) and has a direct link with the avatars of Sri Krishna and Sri Rama, perhaps as disclosed in the account given in Mausalaparva of Sri Maha Bharata. The tradition&rsquo; that Brahma worships Sri Venkateswara every day is kept

up by keeping overnight in the Garbha griham five large gold cups filled with the Akasaganga water and all the other ingredients required for a regular worship. It is this water consecrated by Brahma&rsquo;s worship that is distributed to the worshippers during the Visvarupaseva early in the morning.
We have necessarily given already some of the main and characteristic features of the Dhruva Bēram of Sri Venkateswara, viz., Sri Devi on the right breast seated on Sri Vatsam, the scars on the shoulders, the free and easy posture of the two upper hands into which Chakram and Sankham have subsequently been placed. the Varada posture (freely giving away boons) of the lower right hand and the Katyavalambita posture (holding near to the left hip) of the lower left hand. These might require a word of explanation as we have seen that the Varada posture is not associated with any of the Agama forms of the standing Murti. The palm and the fingers are quite open and point downwards to the right foot. What that signifies is the unrestrained grant of all boons the worshipper seeks. It seems to have a bearing on the boon granted unasked to Maha Bali. Nammalvar in his ten songs about Tiruvengadam1 makes reference to this the Thrivikrama Avatar as the one in which He measured the Earth and saved the soul of Maha Bali. Sri Alavandar also in his Stotra Ratnam makes a prayer for those feet being placed on his head. After the entire universe was measured with the right and the left foot, Trivikrama seems to point to His right foot and to ask with a smile what Bali has

to offer for the remaining portion of the gift promised to Vamana. Mahǎ Bali offered his head which was all he had to give. His promise was fulfilled; and Trivikrama gave in return, unasked by Bali, the highest gift which the Human Soul should ask for, viz., absorption into His feet. The position of the fingers and particularly of the thumb of the left hand in juxtaposition with the hip and the thign suggests that the bow itself or the string of the bow which He bore as Sri Rama (and which was placed on the Murti as stated in Silappadhikaram and in Tiruvoimoli) passed inside of the thumb to maintain a steady position. The next important features are the Pralamba sutram and the Kati sutram. The former is the sacred thread (Yagnopavitam) and the latter the loin string* These distinctly show that the figure does not represent a female Deity nor a Kshudra Devata. They characterise Sri Vishnu. The Kaustubham hanging centrally on the chest is also characteristic of Sri Vishnu and is also described in Silappadhikaram.
The other abharanams or ornaments are those mentioned in Vol. 1. 8 as being worn by the silver Kautuka Beram. These ornaments are exactly similar to those on the body of the Dhruva Bēram. The Agama rule is that the Kautuka Bēram should be an exact representation of the Dhruva Bēram. These have been already described in Chapter VII. We have only to emphasise here that there is nothing like a Nagabharanam on the form of the Dhruva Murti. The gold ornament or plating worn on the arm is a subsequent present made by some votary. Näga or Adisesha is presumed to be inseparably associated with Vishnu and a Tamil song of Sri Poigai ālvār is daily recited during Mantrapushpam1 to remind us of this connection. But the form of the serpent is not represented anywhere in the Garbhagriham, not to speak of its absence on the body of the Deity. There is no Yantram on the Kirectam or crown. Incorrect notions are, however, being repeated through ignorance by bigots of alien creed. These mis-</li>

representations will. however, be referred to at length at the end of this chapter.
The Idols which form a necessary complement to the
Dhruva Beram, viz., the Kautuka, the Snapana. the Utsava and the Bali Beram, will now be mentioned.
BHOGA SRINIVASA, THE KAUTAKA BERAM.
This Idol is made of silver and was consecrated by the donor Samavai in 966 A.D. This was discussed at length in Chapter VII. The idol is a true copy of the Dhruva Bēram. The Chakram and Sankham are, however, permanent fixtures in the case of Bhoga Srinivasa. For a small idol made of silver such a fixture was a necessity. Further we have to bear in mind that when the Kautuka Bēram was made in 966 A.D. the Dhruva Beram had the Chakram and Sankham on the hands. There is another feature on the Bhōga Murti which we presume is in the Dhruva Bēram also. It is impossible to verify it now. On the pedestal (Pitham) and below the feet of the Kautuka Bēram are counterparts of a Yantram (a six pointed figure) as if two equal equilateral triangles are symmetrically interlaced, one being an invert of the other. It is possible that a similar Yantram is on the form of the Dhruva Beram. But none can assert this positively. Sri Nammalvar gives in (3-4-4) a cryptic description of the feet of the Dhruva Beram which when compared with a similar description of the feet of the Tirumal in Tirumal-irum-solai (3-1-1) discloses that under the fect of Tiruvengaḍamuḍayan there was a figure representing radiating arms, whereas in the case of the other Deity the feet rested on a Padmam. The radiating arms would represent the six-pointed ends or vertices of the Shadgunya Yantram, the feet resting on the centrally situated hexagonal portion. The wording of the two descriptions is given below:-

Nammalvar&rsquo;s description was given about two centuries before the date of installation of Manavalapperumal. There was then obviously no pedestal of the Agamic pattern surrounding the Dhruva Bēram. This figure would be on top of the Pitham or pedestal which as usual is represented as if made up of four planks one above the other. All the four are shown as bound together by three girdles known as &ldquo;Trimekhala&rdquo;. This is a mythological pedestal which will be explained in the Chapter on the Agamas. In short the four planks represent Dharmam, Gnanam, Aisvaryam and Vairagyam. They appear in a slightly different order in the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharathra agamas. But they are essential as pedestals in both. On top of this pedestal would be a Padmam with eight or sixteen petals. In the centre of this, or in place of this, should be the six pointed Yantram referred to above. In the case of the Dhruva Bēram, the Padmam itself is covered over and could not now be seen even by the archakas unless the structure of the pedestal is broken up.
But the pedestal itself would have been constructed when the temple was constructed and possibly not before. This statement is based on the practice that the pedestal, the Vedi and the walls of the temple are all proportioned to the height of the standing Murti. There is no evidence that the present temple was built before about 900 A.D. This was discussed in the chapter on Early Accounts (Chapter V). It would have been a known fact about 966 A.D. if there was a Yantram under the feet of Sri Venkateswara. This Yantram would have been copied in the case of the Kautuka Beram.
We could, however, state that a Yantram of this type would represent the six gunas of Para and Vyuha Vasudevas. These gunas are recognised by the Vaikhanasa Agama also:-

It is by the predominance of two of these six gunas at a time that the three Vyuha avatars take place. These six gunas are &ldquo;Gnānam, Aisvaryam. Sakti; Balam, Tejas and Viryam.&rdquo; We could explain the pairing off on the analogy of the proton and the electron. More will be stated about this Yantram in the chapter on Temples and Agamas,&quot;
The Kantuka, Snapana, Utsava and Bali Berams. Kautuka Beram.
Kautaka Beram:-This Murti was installed to make it possible to render daily abhishekam and all the other forms of puja for which a portable Murti is essential. He was intimately connected with the Dhruva Murti by means of a silk cord at the time of installation. A gold link and silk cord are used to maintain the connection even on occasions when He is brought outside the Sanctum Sanctorum for deputising the Dhruva Murti on special festive occasions. He possesses all the powers of the Dhruva Murti. The functions over which He presides are given in the Chapter on Festivals and need not therefore be mentioned here.
Ugra Srinivasa:-He was originally called Venkatatturaivār (வேங்கடத்துறைவார்). The Tamil word shows that He was the resident Dcity in the temple, perhaps even before Bhōga Srinivasa was consecrated. He seems to have been the old processional Murti before Malayappan and the Nachchimar came on the scene. But there are even now three occasions on which He alone figuresUtthana Ekādasi, Mukköti Dvādasi and Dvādasarādhanam.

on daily worship) is over a function known as Koluvu is held in the Tirumāmani Mantapam when the Deity is brought out and seated on a silver chair with gold umbrella held over Him. The Panchangam or Calendar for the day is read out and then follows the reading of the collections from the Hundi (Koppara) made during the previous day. The number and value of all varieties of coins, precious stones. jewels, etc., are given in detail. This is read in public. It is also here in His presence that what is known as Mātrādānam of rice etc., which by custom the archakas are entitled to receive is made. It is not possible to state when this custom had its beginning, nor could we say at what time and how this Murti was introduced into the Sanctum Sanctorum. Although He is also known as Bali Beram, He has never been taken out to offer Bali after the daily puja is over.
Malayappan (the Utsava Murti) and his consorts (Sri Devi and Bhu Devi).
The first mention of this Deity is under the name Malai Kuniy Ninra Perumal (1) about the year 133 A.D. This has been discussed in detail already. Immediately before that date Ugra Srinivasa was in all probability the Processional Deity. He has no consorts with Him. He is like the Dhruva Murti a single Murti wearing the Chakram in a peculiar posture (called the Prayoga Sthiti) as if about to use it. It is possibl that before the Pancharatra exerted its influence on the old Vaikhanasa system this Murti was considered good enough for a procession. A tradition is current among the archakas about how Malai Kuniya Ninra Perumal superceded Ugra Srinivasa, who was known as Venkataṭṭuraivar. On one occasion during the Brahmotsavam when the procession was going round the streets in Tirumala, a terrific fire broke out in the small village which destroyed the houses. The archakas and the devotees did not know why and how this happened. When they prayed to God to forgive any short-coming on their part, an Avēsam came to a man which stated that times have changed and that He should no longer be used as the Processional Deity on pain of recurrence of such calamities. They were also told that ir
188
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENLATESWARA
one of the glades of the mountain there was another Murti whom they should search for and use. So the irate Murti came to be known as Ugra Srinivasa and the new Murti with His consorts who was found after a search was called Malai Kuniya Ninra Perumal (because He was found where the hill bowed very low). In later years the name was shortened into Malayappan. The glade where He was found is now known as Malayappan Kōnai. But for this divine sanction in the form of an Avēsam there would have been serious objection from the archakas to the introduction of a Utsava Murti with the Nachchimars when the Dhruva Murti was a self-manifest single Murti. This would have happened some little time before 1339 A.D. when Sri Ranganatha of Srirangam was also on the Tirumala hill owing to the terror caused by the Muslim invasion of the South. There is no harm in making the guess that this Malayappan would have been the Pancharatra Tiruvilankoyil Peruman of Tiruchchukanoor and that Koluvu Srinivasa (above mentioned) was the Tirumantra Salaipperumal in the same place. During the disturbed days these two Murtis would have been brought for safety to the glade in the hill. A processional Murti with Nachchimars would otherwise have been considered an innovation.
The portable images or Bērams who are by convention taken to represent the Dhruva Murti in their order of precedence are Bhoga Srinivasa, Malayappan with his two consorts, Ugra Srinivasa and Koluvu Srinivasa In the language of the agamas they stand for the Kautuka, the Utsava, the Snapana and the Bali berams (or Bim bams).If the Agama rules of installation had been observed the above would be the order of precedence. The Kautuka-beram would have received consecration direct from the Dhruva Murti and from the Kautuka the Utsava beram gets its consecration and in like manner the Snapana and the Bali berams. But in Tirumala the Dhruva Murti is self-manifest Brahmam and therefore not consecrated by man. The first consecration of a portable image was that of Bhōga Srinivasa (called at that time Manavalapperumal) in 966 A.D. There was however another portable image even before 966 A.D. called Venkatatturaivar. But He would not have been consecrated according to the Agamas, since the Agama
189
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
form of worship was introduced only in 966 A.D. at the time of consecration of Bhoga Srinivasa. Nor is He a correct replica of the Dhruva Beram. That was why Manavalapperumal had to be made in silver and consecrated. So, in the language of the Agama, Manavalapperumal became the Kautuka Bēram. Venkatatturaivar was made to rank next in importance and served as processional Murti (Utsava Murti) till about 1330 A.D. when as already described He was superceded by Malai kuniya, ninra perumal with the two consorts (now known as Malayappan).
This manner of introducing new idols is not in the true Agama style. So the inscriptions do not call Malai kunia ninra peruinal as the Utsava Beram, nor is Bhoga Srinivasa called Kautuka Beram. Nor are Venkataṭṭuraivar and Koluvu Srinivasa described in the inscriptions as Snapana Beram and Bali Beram respectively.
We thus find that in Tirumala these portable idols are not known by the Agama names but only by their popular nomenclature because the Agama rules of consecration were not observed.
Sudarsana: (or Chakrattāļvār) is another Deity in the Sanctum. He figures in separate procession on the Ankurarpanam and on the Tirthavari day of the Brahmotsavam on the Pushkarani bund in front of Sri Varahaswami temple.
The Murtis who deputise for the Dhruva Murti have been described above. We next have to consider the presence of the Processional Murtis&rsquo; of the Sri Rama (Raghunatha) pantheon and those of Sr. Krishna.
Sri Raghunatha and Sri Krishna.
The pantheon of these two processional Murtis will be considered together. Logically neither would be expected to be within the Garbhagriham of Tiruvengadamudaiyan. Their presence has therefore to be accounted for. There is no inscriptional evidence in the matter. In the case of Sri Krishna there is, however, a fragmentary inscription which states that Avani Mulududaiyāļ, the queen of Kulottunga Chola I made an endowment for milk
190
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
and curds for &ldquo;our Tiruvāyppāḍi Āļvān.&rdquo; The words Tirumala Älvän also occurs in it. Although the fragment does not make a coherent statement we may assume that the supply of curds and milk was for the Tiruvayppādi Alvān (or Sri Krishna), who is in the temple of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan. The year might be about 1100 A.D. There is also an ancient usage of the Tirumala temple that during the Dhanur masam it is the idol of Sri Krishna that daily adorns the bed at night during the Ekanta seva; but during the remaining eleven months Bhōga Srinivasa is the Murti for that function. Sri Raghunatha (Sri Rama) however, is not referred to in any inscription before the year 1476 A.D. This will be adverted to presently. That portion of the Sannidhi pradakshinam of the temple which was converted into a room about 1245-1250 A.D. known as Ramar Meda might not have been occupied by the Idols of Sri Raghunatha&rsquo;s pantheon, in 1250 A.D. The probability is otherwise even if Sri Rama and Sri Krishna were in the temple in those days. For neither Malayappan and His consorts nor Koluvu Srinivasa were then in the temple. They appear to have come in after 1330 A.D. There was no shrine or temple of Sri Raghunatha even in Tirupati till 1481 A.D. when one was built and the idol of Sri Raghunatha installed by a staunch Sri Vaishnava, Sathakopadasar Narasimharaya Mudaliyar (II. 73, and 74, 29-10-1481) on Monday, Saptami and Sravana Nakshatra in Tula month Plava year. The same donor made a large endowment (II. 68, 23-11-1476) in 1476 A.D. in connection with the celebration of an annual twelve days&rsquo; festival for Sri Ramanuja in Tirumala. One item of that endowment is for a daily food offering for Sri Raghunatha who is stated to be in the Tirumala shrine. The inscription does not state that he installed Sri Raghunatha. The inscription in Tamil reads IT GETS ÉN நாள் வழி அழது செய்தருளும் படிக்கு திருப்போனகம் ஒன்றும்&rsquo;&rsquo;.

Inscriptions of endowments made for newly installed idols clearly state that they were newly installed. The installation of Sri Raghunatha in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s temple in Tirupati (II. 88,</li>

12-8-1488) is one such. So also is the installation of Sri Ramanuja in Sri Raghunatha&rsquo;s temple in Tirupati (II. 137, 3-6-1497). Wherever there is a shrine for Ramanuja there would be a Raghunatha installed there by His side. Food offerings to Sri Ramanuja could not be made independently. There must be a Divine Murti alongside so that food offered to that Murti could be made over to Sri Ramanuja. The appropriate Murti for Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine is Raghunatha since Ramanuja is considered to be the incarnation of Lakshmana. Therefore when the food offering was made in 1476 to Sri Raghunatha of Tirumala by name as an adjunct to an endowment for Sri Ramanuja the only inference to be drawn is that at the time of installation of Sri Ramanuja in Tirumala there would have been a Raghunatha also there. Although the inscription dated 1476 A.D. does not state that Sri Raghunatha was in Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan&rsquo;s Sannidhi, another inscription of the year 1504 A.D. of an endowment for a Nandavilakku (III. 1. 4-9-1504) distinctly states that it was for Raghunatha existing in Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan&rsquo;s sannidhi
திருவேங்கடமுடையான் சந்நிதியில் எழுந்தருளி இருக்கும் ரகுநாதனுக்கு திருநந்தா லிளக்கு நடக்கும் படிக்கும்&hellip;&rsquo;&rsquo;
&quot;
We could not however dogmatise that a Raghunatha did exist on the date that a shrine was constructed for Ramanuja. In Tirupati for instance there was a shrine for Ramanuja from about 1200 A.D. but a Raghunatha was installed by his side only in 1488 (II. 88-12 8.1488) by one Vignesvara Sriman. Even the independent temple for Raghunatha and the installation of His Image were made only in 1481.
There would have been no objection from any sect of Hindus for installing Sri Raghunatha and Sri Krishna as adjuncts to Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan because He is Narayana come here from Vaikuntam and the two deities are only His Avatars. We have already shown that the Archāvatar of Sri Venkateswara has a logical connection with Sri Rama and Sri Krishna. We have also shown that slokas of the Mantrapushpam referring to these Murtis are based on that conception. There are two stories connected with the life of Sriman Nathamuni and Yamunacharya, which
192
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
suggest that Sri Tirumala Nambi might have installed the idols of Krishna and Rama as he would have had strong sentimental reasons for doing it. The tradition about Nathamuni is that after a long life of 340 years he had an unexpected call from Sri Rama. On a morning when he had gone out for the morning bath two Villis (huntsmen) and a woman with a monkey called at his lodgings. His daughter who was at home informed them that he had gone for his bath. They went away leaving a message that he was wanted by them. This message was delivered to him and straight away he went in search of them. And after a long search got darsan of them in a forest and obtained release from this life. Relating to Sri Yamunacharya (Alavandar) the story is that impelled by a sincere desire to be initiated into Yoga marga he went to meet the great guru Tirukkurukaippirān at a moment when he was in deep meditation with an image in front of him. For fear of disturbing him Yamunacharya hid himself behind a wall in rear. The Yogi suddenly asked whether there was on the spot any scion of the Sottai family (QL ISH PGL). Yamunacharya came forward, submitted with prostration that his humble self was a scion of that family and enquired how the Yogi came to suspect his presence. The reply was that the idol of Sri Krishna turned his face to the wall which could have occurred only if there was one of the Sottai family there; for he is so partial to them. Yamunacharya was Tirumala Nambi&rsquo;s grand-father at whose feet the latter learnt his spiritual lessons. It was after hearing his exposition of a portion of Nammāļvār&rsquo;s Prabandham in praise of Sri Venkatesvara he came away to Tirumala and dedicated himself solely and unreservedly to the service of Tiruvengadamudaiyan. Sriman Nätha Munigal was Yamunacharya&rsquo;s grand father and was the founder of that system of faith or Bhakti which culminated in Sri Ramanuja Siddhantam dealt with in his Sri Bhashya. There is another point also. Tirumala Nambi himself was in his life time the best exponent of the esoteric meanings of Valmiki&rsquo;s Ramayana and Sri Ramanuja sat at his feet for one year to imbibe the interpretations. His intense devotion to Sri Raghunatha and Sri Krishna could therefore be well appreciated by us.

193
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Therefore, the probability amounting to a certainty is that Tirumala Nambi installed in the Garbha Griham the images of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna during his life time even if they were not installed before.
It may be mentioned here that neither Sri Raghunatha nor Sri Krishna enjoys separate daily puja. They share in the Nityar. chana for Sri Venkatesa. All food offerings made in the Garbha Griham are first offered to Sri Venkateswara even when intended for Sri Rama or Sri Krishna. But in asthanams and processions outside the Garbhagriham the particular idol gets the offerings direct. This procedure is distinctly mentioned in the inscriptions, such as (II. 88. 12-8-1486)1 for offerings made outside the temple direct to Sri Krishna.
THE TEMPLE, ITS PECULIARITIES.
It has already been shown that the temple with its one Murti (Eka Murti) and devoid of ancillary deities which the Samhita prescribes shows distinctly that from the earliest days it stood out as something different from the Agama types. It was also shown how the idea of setting up more Murtis in the niches of the first pradakshinam did not succeed. There are some other features also which will be referred to now.

MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
Dhatri and Vidhatri guarding the door-way, the former on the south side and facing North, the latter on the North side facing South. Bhuvanga lying on the sill of the door frame with his head on the south and facing up. Patanga would be pictured on the soffit stone with his head on the North and facing down. The Dvarapalas on (the first door-way) either side of this door would be Manikam and Sandhya. The Dvarapalas at the Mukha mantapam door-way would be Vikhanas and Tapasa. The Dvarapalas at Prathamavarana doorway would be Kishkindam and Tirtha. The Dvarapalas at the second avarana doorway would be Vakratunda (Ganesa) and Nagaraja (Serpent). Not one of these is depicted in this temple. Other essential elements (in addition to the above) to make up an Adhamadhama temple (lowest) are Vishvaksena, Garuda, Sribhutam, Nyaksha and Bhutapitham. We have only Vishvaksena and Garuda in their proper place in the temple. Sri Bhutam who should be in the Sopanam in the first avaranam finds his place among the five stones placed between the Dhvajastambham and Balipitham which are outside the inner gopuram. Nyaksha is not figured. The next higher type of temple, the Adhama Madhyama, should have in addition to the above, Indra and the other digdevatas (8), Bhaskara, Chakram, Sankham. The digdevatas are only to be imagined in this temple while Bhaskara, Sankam and Chakram are grouped into the five stones referred to above.
Vishvaksena, and Garuda as also Dhvajastambham and Balipitham are common to all classes of temples, Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra, even of the commonest type. The devatas and the dikpälas etc., are essential deities in a Vaikhanasa temple. Every day the Bali Beram of Sri Venkateswara should be taken out for offering &lsquo;havis&rsquo; to these. The procession should be in a palanquin accompanied by music, dancers, songsters, etc. There are nrittam, ragam and music to be done before each devata, in the appropriate manner prescribed for each. This is called Nityotsavam and is common to Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra temples. Such a festival does not appear to have been in vogue during any period of the history of this temple. It was already stated that the Mantrapushpam ritual is something specially coined
195
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
for this temple. It is not of the pattern given in any Agama. The Brahmaradhanam by night seems to have cut out the necessity for strict observance of the Agama procedure. The Vaikhanasas have however been doing the puja from time immemorial. The abbreviated form of worship which was current seems to have in the course of ages affected their competency and to have made it necessary for them to import one family from some other part of the country for celebrating the rituals of the annual festival in the proper manner. This family consequently enjoys a greater share in the emoluments than the others. If the daily pujas were performed scrupulously and in strict accordance with the Agamas there would be little time left to the pilgrims for Darshan.
The Other Berams.
In this connection a few words have to be said about the other Berams, that is other than the Kautuka Beram, in the matter of food offering. Each Beram should get its own share of food in relation to the quantity offered to the Dhruva Beram. The usual share would be something like the following. Dhruva Beram one dronam or marakkal or tumbu. For Devi half a tümbu, Kautukam half dronam; Utsava Beram, half dronam; Snapana, half dronam and Bali Beram half dronam. Jaggery in addition by day and payasam by night. When a temple is consecrated for the first time all these Murtis and Berams would be installed and due provision made for the ration to each (at least for the day time). We know that Samavai while consecrating the Kautuka Beram made a provision of four nali of rice per day (four nāļi may be equal to a dronam). There was not a Utsava Murti then. Malayappan comes to light only about 1339 A.D. Nobody made an endowment for the supply of food ration for this Murti. Nor do we hear of any endowment for the other Berams. If Bhoga Srinivasa was offered 4 nāļi of rice per day, the Dhruva Beram and Sri Devi should have been receiving (12 nāļis) one dronam and a half per day. Inscriptional evidence for the quantity offered to the Dhruva Beram is wanting. But from a certain inscription of the thirteenth century! we learn that one half of the village of</li>

196
MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
Paiyidipalle was the property of Sri Venkateswara from ancient times. One family of the Archakas is known as Paidipalle dikshitulu. It is likely that this family was from very early days in enjoyment of the income from one half of the village of Paindipalle. This Archaka would have been offering to the Deity a certain quantity of cooked rice and, as has been the ancient usage, himself enjoying that food. The Agamas make it incumbent on the donor who consecrates a temple to make an adequate endowment of land to enable the archaka to lead a happy and contented life. All the other idols which came in later do not appear to have been provided for separately. From the Vaikhanasa point of view these were intruders, not having been consecrated properly. This affords us indirect evidence that the temple was not consecrated strictly in accordance with the Vaikhanasa or Pancharathra Agama.
Some Crude and Incorrect Notions.
The description and the explanation given above show that the Dhruva Murti in Tirumala represents some form of Vishnu. There are, however, some persons, they might be few in number, who consider the Murti to represent Subramaniaswami, Durga or some form of Sakti. They point to this or that emblem or symbol which is common to several Deities, to sayings or statements alleged to have been made by Sri Sankaracharya and to incorrect information given by men. Some of these are given collectively in a book recently published by one Sri V. N. Srinivasa Rao, a
Retired Tahsildar.
(1) Because North Indians call Srinivasa by the name Bālāji and because Durga seems to be known by the name Bālā when she was nine years of age, Sri Venkatesa is Durga. Is this not fine logic? He forgets that North Indians commenced going to Tirupati only from the days of Sivaji in the middle of the seventeenth century A.D. The Bhagavata slokam-&rdquo; Tamadbhutam Balakamambujekshanam etc.,&quot; in describing the Darsan which Sri Krishna gave to His father soon after His birth may be referred to in this connection. We have already shown how closely this avatar has been recognised to be associated with Sri Venkateswara. A standing Murti with a lovely countenance and plump body
197
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
fully decorated with ornaments would appropriately be called &ldquo;Balaka.&rdquo;
(2) People considered the Tirumala Hill a form of Mēruchakram which is a form of Devi. No one could take objection to that conception if one stretches his imagination to that extent. But the range of hills has always been called Vengadam. Even the name Seshachalam is of recent origin. Because the hill is so sacred as to burn away all sins and because people wish to worship the God thereon it is considered good manners to ascend the hills after bathing and wearing fresh or wet clothes. We are only surprised that the author did not add another argument that those who have a prarthana to fulfil wear cloth dyed in turmeric water to please Durga thereby.
(3) He adds that the real name of Galigōpuram is Kāli Gōpuram. The gōpuram itself was constructed in 1628 A.D. a fact perhaps not known to the author. The gōpuram was built by a rank Sri Vaishnava (Matla Anantaraja) who would not have left an inch of space for Kāli there.
(4) &ldquo;At the corners of the top of the central Vimanam are placed forms of couchant lions, the vehicle and emblem of Sakti.&rsquo;, We do not dispute it. But the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra Agamas require that either the lion or the eagle (Garuda) should be placed at the corners.

MURTI SWARUPAM OF SRI VENKATESWARA
Not only on top of Vimanam but also at corners on top of mantapams either of these should be placed. The lion is selected to ward off enemies of the King if the temple is situated in a locality where that consideration is necessary. If for spiritual and cultural ends only Garuda. We know that Vira Narasinga Yadavarāya built the Vimanam. The couchant lion would naturally have been preferred. It is unfortunate that the images of Ganesa and of Durga who should also find a place in the temple as per Agamas have not been placed in this temple. If that had been done Mr. Srinivasa Rao could have pointed to them to strengthen his argu-
ments.
(5) Simha lalatams, Jata and Srichakram on the crown. There is no jata on the head of the Murti, a fact already mentioned. Nor is there a Sri Chakram on the Kireetam. Mr. Rao could have had no occasion, to go near the Dhruva Bēram to observe the features of the Crown (or Kireetam). Even the Acharyapurushas do not enjoy that privilege. Unless the officiating Archaka is a very tall man even he could not satisfy the desire to observe at close quarters.
The so-called Simha lalātam is a common engraving on certain ornaments, including those covering the marmasthanam of male as well as female figures. It is a very rough delineation which by a stretch of imagination we associate with the face of a lion. It could be seen on many images of both sexes.
(6) The Ritual aspect-Sakti. Here again Mr. Rao is illinformed. Referring to the &ldquo;Drapery&rdquo; which is usually called &ldquo;Ulchattu,,&rdquo; he points to its long length as a definite proof of the Deity being Durga or Sakti. This Ulchattu is of recent origin and has been necessitated by the large number of heavy ornaments and ayudhams with which the Deity is decorated. Commonsense would tell us that a thick padding should be provided if these ornaments, many of which have sharp edges, are not to injure the fine markings etc., on the form of the Murti. How much care is bestowed in the arrangement of the folds of the cloth, it is only those who have the privilege to witness that could realise.

The Nagabharana is not an ornament integral with the body of the Murti. There is nothing corresponding to it on the image. The Naga is one of the Nityas ever present with Vishnu Murti. Its absence. even as the Seat or Sandals of Srinivasa is a unique feature. The Nagabharana connotes nothing in particular.
The sandal paste was introduced only in the fifteenth century A.D. Inscriptions are our authority. Balls of perfumed sandal paste not only adorn Sri Devi on the chest by night but two balls (billas) are placed over the feet of the Dhruva Beram. Gandham is sacred to Vishnu.
The abhishekam and its origin have been explained in connection with the installation of Bhoga Srinivasa. Turmeric bath is not given to Srinivasa on Fridays. Saffron paste is added to the water. For Snapana Tirumanjanam of all Vishnu Murtis, turmeric is however one of the ingredients. Neither Vada nor payasam is offered to the Deity after the bath. Pōli is offered during the second bell. Even that is of recent origin. It has no antiquity behind it.
Abhishekam for the gold emblem of the Goddess
Alarmel Mangai.
This image is not an integral part of the Dhruva Beram. It is really an ornament presented by some Bhakta (they say it is one of the Maharajahs of Mysore) for permanent wear; and endowment also was made for its abhishekam. This Goddess is removed and abhishekam done separately for the simple reason that it should not receive the same along with the Murti and Sri Devi. It is not open to every worshipper to see how it is hung and how it is removed and refitted. Hence the screen and the secrecy.
(7) There is neither a meru chakra under the pedestal of Bhoga Srinivasa nor any puja therefor. All puja is only for the Dhruva Murti, the Bhoga Beram and the other idols. If the screen is put on it is for replacing the Bhoga Murti from the Snapana pitham to its Archā pitham.

These operations could not be carried out in the presence of all. The Agamas enjoin screening on such occasions. The Yantram which is on the pedestal and also under the feet of Bhōga Srinivasa has already been referred to. The idol itself was installed in Sri Alavandar&rsquo;s life time in 966 A.D.
(8) Bilva Patram:&ndash;This is one of the eight punya pushpams acceptable to Vishnu in the daily puja:
Padmasamhita. 12 Adhyaye (Charyāpade):-
&ldquo;Thulasichathushtayamdürvā bilvapathram cha Pūjārhāni.
Thulasyau sithakṛsnecha kevalakshapakāsthathā Chathvarasthulasibheda durvabilradalănicha

From Brigu Samhita Page 185:-
&ldquo;Nandyavarthañcha padmañcha thulasivishnu Parṇikā: Bilvancha karaveerañcha padmam kumudame vacha Ashta vai punapushpāņi grāhyāņi thu yathākramam“,
Both the Agamas recommend its use. The question should be put the other way. Why is it not used every day along with tulasi? Its exclusion was meant probably to keep off ignorant fanatics laying claim to the Deity as something other than Vishnu.
(9) Brahmotsavam:&ndash;Mr. Rao does not probably know that it has always been called Puraṭṭāsi Brahmotsavam and that the period is regulated by the criterion that the Tirthavari should be

on the morning of the day when Sravana Nakshatram is current. The additional or second one which coincides with the Dasara occurs once in four years when there is an adhika māsam. The latter practice commenced with the advent of Saluva Narasimha and the Vijayanagar kings to give satisfaction to those who observe the Saura Chandramana Panchangam.
(10) Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s image is in the centre of the Garbha Griham and is therefore a Saivite Murti:
Here again Mr. Rao wrote out of sheer ignorance. If he had madea cursoryacquaintance with the Agama rules for the installation of standing, sitting and reposing Murtis of Vishnu he would have realised his mistake. The location of the Mürti in the Garbha Griham has already been explained in the chapter dealing with temple structures. The place for Siva in a Vishnu Garbha Griham is the Paisacha zone just abutting the walls. The Dhruva Beram should occupy the Daivika zone. Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s image is precisely in this zone.
(11) There is an outlet (Gomukham) from the Garbha Griham. Why it is not working has already been explained. Regarding the height of the Garbha Griham, it has already been explained that it bears a definite relation to the height of the Murti. The builders have observed the rule.
(12) The floor has at no time been raised. The height of the Dhruva Bēra Pitham makes this obvious and is proportionate to the Bhuvanga or height of door-step.
(13) Srivatsam:-Mr. Rao writes that the markings of the Srivatsam on the right chest, near the shoulder (instead of on the middle of the left chest as is usual with the Vishnu images) betray hasty and imperfect execution by later artists. He displays here not only his ignorance but the audacity in stating that some later artist interfered with the Murti and executed the work. The place of Yoga Lakshmi and that of Srivatsam may be gathered from the quotation given below from the Bhrigu Samhita, Lakshmi kalpam (in the case of new temples and the installation of idols therein).

Lakshmi is on the upper portion of the right breast (Daksha Stana-urdhva bhāgam) Vahnyasra manḍalam and her place is over the Srivatsam as is well known to every Sri Vaishnava. The last line of the quotation deserves attention. The markings of Srivatsam depend on the rupam or form of the particular Murti and is not identical for all. Srivatsam represents the Mula Prakriti and Sri Devi is its Adhishtana Devata.1
(14) Crystal Lingam:-There is no Crystal Lingam anywhere in the Tirumala temple. Mr. Rao imagines that Sri Vidyaranya has stated so. Sri Vidyaranya was the contemporary of Sri Vēdānta Desika in the latter part of the 13th and early part of the 14th century. As for the connection which Kapila and Bhrigu are said to have had it may be stated that Kapila, Bhrigu, Ganesa,

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Durga, Siva, and Brahma are all Upadevatas in a temple consecrated to Vishnu according to both the Vaishnavite Agamas. But they never had a place in Tirumala for the simple reason that Sri Venkateswara is svayamvyakla murti and not consecrated according to Agamas. There is also no antiquity about the temple of Sri Kapileswara Swami.
1 Ancient autherity from Sri Nammalvar&rsquo;s Tiruvoimoli for the existence of Srivatsam and Lakshmi on the breast of the Dhruva Murti has already been referred to. The relevant portions of the stanzas are given below and also Sri Andal&rsquo;s statement in Nachchiar Tirumoli with the same effect is quoted.

CHAPTER IX.
NITYARCHANA (OR DAILY WORSHIP) IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE.
FROM what has been stated in the previous chapters it would
be clear that as the Dhruva Mürti was neither made nor consecrated by man, the temple could not have had a definite form of ritualistic worship in its early days. It was also pointed out that for the worship of the dual form (a combination of Vishnu and Siva in one Mürti) which one of the Mudal-Alvars appear to have scen in Tirumala there is no ritual prescribed in any of the Agamas.1 The description given in the Silappadhikaram does not also speak of any ritualistic worship. The proportioning of the size of the Garbha Griham which bears a relationship to the height of the Dhruva Mürti shows that the temple was built to accord with the Vaikhānasa Agama (and Agamas in general). It was stated that the probable date of the construction of the original templc of cut-stone might be about 900 A.D. It was also inferred from the wording of inscription No. I. 8 that ritualistic worship (or Karmarchana) commenced in 966 A.D. when the silver Kautuka Bēram called Manavalapperumal (or Bhōga Srinivasa) was installed and consecrated for that special purpose. The sanctity of Tiruvengadam however did not depend on the temple structure or on the Karmarchana which man introduced, because divinity was not invoked by a consecration ritual. God manifested Himself there and Brahma along with the Devas has been doing the puja by night for their own spiritual benefit just as we are doing for our benefit, spiritual and temporal. This tradition that Brahma</li>
<li>Tiruppapa Alwar says in verse 3 of his Amalanädapiran that on the Vengadam Hills the worship is being carried on by the Heavenly beings which refer to Brahma, Indra, Rudra, and the others.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
conducts a worship by night has always been kept up in Tirumala. Every night before the doors of the Garbha Griham are closed five large gold cups (vattils) are filled with clean water and all the spices required are put therein. All the other puja articles are also left on a plate. It is this consecrated water that is distributed to the devotees during the morning Darsan knwon as Visvarūpasēva. Devotees who are not Sri Vaishnavas have thus the satisfaction that the tirtham offered to them is water consecrated by Brahma himself. The worship which the Vaikhānasa Archakas carry on is therefore secondary in character. Imperfections in that form of worship and differences from other forms are therefore ignored in practice. When the Supreme Being (Para Vasudeva) manifested Himself in Tirumala, He did not bring with him a Vaikhanasa Archaka or the Marichi Samhita. This is where Tirumala differs from other places of worship.
Although the Vaikhānasa form of worhsip has been in vogue from ancient times there has not been in practice strict observance of the procedure laid down therefor. For instance in 966 A.D. only 4 nālis of rice per day were endowed by Samavai for the daily nimandam of Bhōga Srinivasa. The probability therefore is that there would have been only one puja performed during the day time when cooked food or Havis was offered. We do not bear of a night puja for a long time. A puja along with Havis at dawn (Arunodaya kālam) was instituted by Tirukkalikanridāsar Alagappiränar in 1434 A.D.; and that was only for six months covered by the Dakshinayanam.
Before giving an account of the daily puja which is now in vogue it is desirable to state the recommendations made in the Vaikhanasa Agama. The Pancharatra Agama has its own classifications and recommendations which will also be referred to wherever necessary.
The Vaikhanasa Agama recommends puja six times a day, viz., Pratyusham (Arunodayam or Ushashkalam); (2) Prabhatam (Pratahkālam); (3) Madhyahnam (noon); (4) Aparähnam (after noon); (5) Sayankalam (evening); and (6) Nisi (midnight or Ardhaya-

mam). This order is not being observed in Tirumala.1 Except during the month of Margasira there is no puja performed before day break. Nor is there puja done early in the morning soon after sunrise. The Visvarupaseva which takes place early in the morning affords only an occasion for devotees to worship the Deity. Milk, butter and sugar are offered on this occasion. The third item viz., Madhyahna puja corresponds to the Tōmālasēva and archana. The food offering which accompanies it is called the first bell. This is the only occasion during the daytime when Abhishekam is done. The fourth item is the Aparahna&rsquo;puja which corresponds to the second archana and second bell with food offering. This function is an abbreviated one. The fifth is the Sayankalapuja which takes place as a strictly private function. There is food offering in connection with this also. The sixth or Nisi puja corresponds to the Ekantaseva which is really no puja. Bhōga Srinivasa adorns the bed prepared for the night. Milk, payasam, fruits, nuts etc., are offered and sweet music played. This function should logically have no place in this temple where during the night puja is done by Brahma himself and therefore the Deity would not be sleeping in bed.
Benefits Conferred by the Shatkala Pujas.
The Agama says that the pujas performed six times a day are really for our own material welfare. Puja in Ushahkālam promotes</li>
<li>Kulasekhara Alwar in his Tirumoli 1-7 states that worship 6 time a day was carried on in Sri Rangam and that would have been early in the 8th century A. D. But there is no such worship in Tirumala.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the vriddhi (or increase) of praja and pasu. Prātahkāla puja promotes japa and homa. Madhyahna pūja is for the abhivriddhi of the Rajarashtram. Aparahna pūja brings about the destruction of daityas (evil doers). The Sayankala puja is for increased production of grains and pulses (sasya). The midnight (Nisi) puja is for increase of cattle wealth. But as it is not always possible to do puja six times a day in every temple, the same agama recommends a minimum of one puja a day.1

· Shatkālam và thrikālam và dvikalam
ēkakālam vā Pūjanam devadevasya.&rdquo; |
We know that in Tirumala it is impossible to have six pujas performed every day in a leisurely manner. The Pancharatra Agama goes a step further than the Vaikhanasa and speaks of one, two, three, four, five, six, or even twelve pujas a day if that could be managed.
In Tirumala there are really only two pujas performed in extenso. The one in the morning is associated with the name Tōmāla Sēva which is open to the public on payment of a fee. The second one in the evening (night) is, as already stated, strictly private in which the Archakas, the Paricharakas and the Acharyapurushas only take part. There is also an abridged puja in the afternoon. Among the lakhs of pilgrims who go there, there would only be an infinitesimally small number who have even an elementary knowledge of the form of puja. It is perhaps for this reason that the component parts of the puja are not mentioned by their ritualistic names. They are called Sevas; such as Visvarupa seva, Tōmāla Seva, First Archana, Koluvu seva, Naivedyam, Sattumurai, second archana, second Naivedyam, Dharma seva and Ekāntasēva. Dharma seva, Koluvu and Visvarupa sevas are open to all freely. For Naivedyam only the Archakas are allowed inside the sanctum. For Sattumurai (reciting portions of the Tamil prabhandam and praise of some Vaishnavite Acharyas) Srivaishnavas only are allowed since they alone take an active part in it.</li>

NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
Darsan in connection with the Tomala Seva and Ekanta Seva could be had only on payment of the prescribed fee. The pilgrim would only be witnessing the functions. In the case of archana however the name of the ticket holder with his götram would be mentioned at the end of the archana and the Lord invoked to give His blessings. Usually there is hardly standing space available for all the ticket holders to witness the functions with a feeling of physical comfort.
As there would be at least a few who would like to know what the course of the daily puja is like, a short description will be attempted. The routine of the puja is mainly of the Vaikhanasa type, but not in strict accordance thereto. There are intrusions, deviations and abridgements. In the orthodax Vaikhanasa form of worship there is no room for one who is not a born Vaikhanasa to participate. If for any unavoidable reason an alien takes part in the puja, that other is known by the name Devalaka, and he is looked down upon. In the Tirumala and the Tirupati Temples the Parichāraka is a Sanyasi who does not go through the formality of receiving diksha or initiation at the hands of a Vaikhanasa dikshita. Yet another person who performs the Mantrapushpam is an Acharyapurusha whom the Vaikhanasa would look upon as Devalaka. It does not however appear from the inscriptions that a sanyasi was doing the Paricharaka service before Srimad Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar became the Kartar of the Arisinālayam matham about 1380 A.D. and one of the Sthanattars about 1390 A.D. He was probably the first sanyasi who took up the Paricharaka service in addition to his other duties as one of the Sthanattars. The claim of the Vaikhanasas to have their own men in the religious services does not appear to have been ever recognised in this temple. As the Dhruva Murti was not consecrated by the Vaikhanasa, any Srivaishnava is eligible to render religious service of one kind or another.
The routine of Nityarchana.
Early in the morning the Archaka after finishing his bath and his nitya karmanushthanam should do his &lsquo;pranamam&rsquo; to the key
14
209
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of the sanctum and proceed to the temple holding it on his head and accompanied by the Paricharaka and the temple paraphernalia and music. After duly perambulating the pradakshinam and prostrating before the dvara devas, he should open the door uttering the mantram appropriate for the occasion and enter the sanctum. Facing the Deity he does his pranamam reciting the mantram &ldquo;Atō Deva&hellip;&hellip;. .&rdquo; The Paricharaka should attend to the lighting of the lamps. A mirror should be presented to the Deity while still in bed. Songsters, maidens, horses, cows etc., should be made to stand before the Deity. Brahmins should recite the Vedas (Brahmanan Veda vidushah), dancers should dance and songsters sing praises. They should all remain in theMukhamantapam. Then Härati (Nīrājanam) should be done. At this stage fresh drawn cow&rsquo;s milk, navanitham and sugar should be offered to the Deity.1
The Deity who was in the bed is now removed to the jivasthānam. The practice in Tirumala however is for the donors to be closed soon after the archaka, paricharaka and the golla (lamp lighter and sweeper) enter the Sanctum. In front of the closed doors the songsters sing and certain Sanskrit verses in praise of Srinivasa are recited till the doors are reopened after Bhoga Srinivasa is shifted to His jivasthanam from the bed. Cows, horses, elephants etc., are not present for the function, neither do Brahmins recite the Vedas. The camphor, hārati, cow&rsquo;s milk and navanitham are offered only after the Idol is removed to the jīvasthanam and not while yet in bed. No mirror is presented to the Deity&rsquo;s face.
The Visvarupa Seva.
Devotees are then allowed to have darsan of the Dhruva Beram and Bhōga Srinivasa. This darsan is known as &ldquo;Visvarūpa Seva.&rdquo; It got mixed up with the function of waking up the Kautuka Beram called Bhōga Srinivasa. This Visvarupa Seva is the darsan</p>

NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
which is associated with the puja performed by Brahma overnight. Worshippers get the Tirtham of that puja as part of the darsan. Pilgrims get this darsan free, except on Friday mornings.
There are a few adjuncts to this seva which grew up gradually. A pinch of sandal paste from out of a big ball might be given to some. A small piece of perfumed silk cloth would also be presented. The small paste is called Sripada chandanam and the cloth Sri pada vastram. The former is applied to the forehead by the devotee and the cloth pressed to one&rsquo;s forehead in reverence and returned. These are articles which were in contact with the Holy feet of the Dhruva Murti overnight. When Bhoga Srinivasa was put to bed overnight, a half billa (cupful) of perfumed sandal paste was placed over His Chest; a quarter billa was placed over &quot; Alamēlu Mangai Nachchiyar &quot; adorning the chest of the Dhruva Murti. Another quarter billa was left along with articles for the Brahma puja during the night. In addition to the above, two full billas (two balls) were placed over the Holy feet of the Dhruva Murti after removing the gold kavacham covering the feet and after wiping off the civet oil with the piece of silk cloth referred to. It is from these two balls of perfumed chandanam that the devotee is given a pinch during the Visvarupa seva. The billas would also be placed in one&rsquo;s hands so that he might press them both to his eyes. The practice is not however an ancient one. It seems to have had its origin in the middle of the fifteenth century A.D. (Vol. II No. 40, 1469 A.D.). The use of civet oil was the work of Tirukkalikandridasar Alagappirânãr. Subsequently Saluva Narasimha and Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyangar introduced the others. The term Visvarupa seva does not however occur in the inscriptions. There would in any case have been a morning darsan of the God arranged for the benefit of the pilgrims. The fine songs of the Tallapakkam Annamachar would have been sung for the first time in Tirumala only during the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Mahārāya in the first quarter of the sixteenth century A.D. The heartening Sanskrit slokas of the Suprabhatam would have been recited at the beginning of the fifteenth century or in the closing years of the fourteenth century since Prativădibhayankaram Annan, reputed to be the composer, flourished in the closing years
211HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of Sri Vedanta Desika. Sri Tallapakkam Tirumalai Ayyan seems to be the first among the members of the Tallapakkam family who made Tirumala his abode and he flourished in the sixteenth century. How the morning was welcomed in the temple in the centuries before the fifteenth it is not possible to conjecture. We are certain that the Vedas were not recited in congregation before 1430 A.D. in which year Sri Virapratāpa Devaraya Maharaya made the first arrangement for recitation of the Vedas. We are also sure that the Tamil Prabhandams were not recited inside the temple before the year 1476 A.D. In fact the Tamil Prabhandam songs known as Tiruppallieluchchi (waking the Deity while in bed) are not sung along with the Suprabhatam and the Tallapakkam songs for waking up the deity. The Tamil songs are recited later at the commencement of the Tomāla seva, as if the morning sun was just then peeping over the horizon. These songs are also not in praise of Srinivasa but of Sri Ranganatha. We must assume that the morning function was in the early centuries a silent one. In fact 1434 A.D. seems to have been the first year when a ushahkalam (arunodaya) sandhi offering was made.
It is likely that the singing of the Tiruppallieluchchi in the morning in front of Sri Ranganatha when he was sojourning in Tirumala between the years 1330 and 1360 A.D. gave the impetus for composing the Suprabhatam slokas in Sanskrit in praise of Sri Venkateswara. The Tallapakkam songs in Telugu would have come in a century later.
THE TOMALA SEVA OR THE MAIN PUJA
FOR THE DAY.
The Tamil expression Tomalai (GDN) is probably a contraction of @@sur (made up flower garlands). The decoration of the Dhruva Bēram with flower garlands has been the characteristic feature of the Tirumala Temple. The expression is intended to call the pilgrim&rsquo;s special attention to the flower decoration which takes place at the fag end of the puja. The flower garlands are made in several pieces, each piece being of a
212
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
particular size so that the decoration could be done in a spectacular manner and without waste of time.
After the dharma darsan of the early morning called Visvarupa Seva is finished the sanctum is cleared of the pilgrims and the big screen is put on at the Bangaru Väkili. The Sanctum Sanctorum is cleaned, which process is known as Suddhi (). In this process are included such things as the removal of all the previous night&rsquo;s flower decoration of the Dhruva Murti, etc., and the cleaning of all the vessels required for the puja. Such of the garlands as adorned the Dhruva Murti are presumed to be used to adorn Vishvaksēna.
“Dēvanirmalya sēshēna Vishvaksenam Vibhushya cha
Anyanirmalyanādāya suchisthane&rsquo;psu vā kshipet.&rdquo;
The other flowers are bundled up and thrown into a well. No part of it could be used by any human being, nor could it be used for any other deity. But in practice even Vishvaksena is ignored as there is no direct approach to Him from within the Sanctum. His shrine unfortunately came to be segregated in the first ävaranam of the temple about 1250 A.D. and He therefore stands neglected. The removal of old flowers is known as &ldquo;Nirmalya Sodhana.&rdquo;
In the meantime the water required for the puja would have arriyed from the Akasaganga water falls. The bringing of three potfulls of this water is the inalienable right and bounden duty of the family of Tirumala Nambi who form the Prathama Acharya Purushas of the temples in Tirumala and Tirupati. One pot of water is used for the forenoon puja, one pot for the evening puja while the third is kept in reserve for the Brahma ärādhanam after the temple doors are closed for the night. This Akasaganga water is used for filling up the five vattils, or large silver cups used for the puja. The Vaikhanasa Samhita says that every day the water for the puja should be brought in procession on the back of an elephant. But it is so done only during the days of the Brahmotsavam. Even then the water which is so brought is not
213
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
used for the puja but only what is brought on the head by brahmins.1
Marichi Samhita (Vimanarchana kalpam) does not however say that the water should be conveyed in procession on an elephant.
A detailed account of the Nityarchana might not interest the average reader or worshipper. It is enough to state that the water brought for use should be consecrated ritually and that some herbs and articles of perfume are recommended to be put into the five vattils or large cups which are filled with the water. As this is not being observed in Tirumala, what these articles are and their medicinal properties will be given in a separate note. The puja or archana is divided into the following parts. These are (1) Mantrasanam when the Deity is presumed to be cleaning the teeth and washing the face, (2) Snanāsanam, when the Deity is given a bath, (3) Alankarasanam, when fresh clothes are put on, ürdhva pundrom painted, etc. It is as it were, the durbar, (4) Bhōjyasanam, when Neivedyam or cooked food is offered (5) Yatrasanam when Bali Homam is done and the Bali Idol is taken out in procession to see that food is given to all the parivāra devatās, (6) Sayanam takes place only by night after the ardhayamapūja or Ēkāntasēvā.

(for cleaning the hands, washing the feet and for sipping or washing the mouth).
Snanasanam:-As it is not feasible to do abhishekam to the Dhruva Beram every day, the Agama practice is to do the abhishekam to the Kautuka Beram. In this temple the gold (covering or) kavachams of the Holy Feet of the Dhruva Beram are also removed to a separate seat and given abhishekam. A large number of Saligramams also receive the abhishekam.
The Kautuka Beram, i.e., Bhoga Srinivasa, is shifted from His permanent seat or jivasthanam and placed on a bathing seat (snapanapitham). Before this is done the gold wire connecting it with the Dhruva Murti is detached. A light clothing is provided. The abhishekam is a ritualistic function which takes place to the accompaniment of the recitation of Vedic hymns such as Purushasūktam, etc. The idol is first anointed with perfumed oil and the oily matter removed by use of tamarind (or such like) paste and water Then follow a series of baths with cow&rsquo;s milk, sandal paste, honey (madhu) and turmeric water (haridrodakam). Every time clean water bath is given before the abhishekam is done Again gandhodakam (sandal paste water) bath is given Finally a clean water bath A sahasradhāra plate is invariably used so as to give a shower bath Then the idol is wiped dry with cloth, pushpanjali done before being restored to the jivasthanam After doing prōkshana to the Dhruva Bēram the sambhandam oi connecting link between the two is restored and pushpanyāsam done to the feet of the Dhruva Bēram At every stage the appropriate mantras are pronounced
The next step is the performance of Pushpanyasam for the Devas in the first, second and third avaranas in the piadakshina order commencing
from Purusha in the east Similar pushpanyasa is done for the three avarana devas of the Kautuka Beram then for Markandeya, Bhrigu, Brahma and Sankara. Then come the pushpanyasams for the Dvaradevas, dvarapalas, the Vimanapālas. etc. Lastly, the door-step of the garbhagriham would be cleaned with water at either end and in the centre and archana done likewise for Dharmam, Gñānam, and Aisvaryam This does not

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
appear to be done in Tirumala. Marichi Samhita is cryptic in its account as the detailed procedure would be given to the archaka during his diksha only. The Agama rule is that the nyasa for an absent (unrepresented) deva should be deposited between the feet of the Dhruva Beram. We know that in the Tirumala Temple not one of these devatas is represented by an image or even by a painting on the wall. So all the nyasa flowers are deposited in between the feet of the Dhruva Beram. This fact is of interest to us as it is possibly for this reason that tulasi is not given to the worshippers as one of the prasadams of Sri Venkateswara. If these devas had separate representation in the temple the puja flower for each would have been laid at its feet and the tulasi at the feet of Sri Venkateswara would represent His prasadam only. The mass of flowers and tulasi now being laid at His feet however represent the prasadams of other dēvatas also. The prasadams of other devatas would be acceptable only to those who do upāsana or worship to them individually for the attainment of material benefits which they could bestow. But to the worshipper of the Adi Murti, viz., Sri Venkateswara they are taboo. It is probably for this reason that all flowers, etc., at the feet of the Dhruva Beram are dumped into a well. The flowers worn by the Adi Murti are the exclusive property of Vishvaksena and should be used to adorn him. We will point out presently how the absence of the images of the devas and the mutilated condition of the first åvaranam (Mukkoti pradakshinam) account for the perfunctory manner in which Bali (food offerings to Devatas) is done without celebrating the Nityötsavam ordained by the Agamas.
Alankarasanam:-In this asanam, vastram, bhushanam and uttarlyam (clothes, ornaments and flower decorations) are put on. Urdhvapundram mark is invested to the accompaniment of the ashtakshara mantram and yagnopavitam (sacred thread) also. In Tirumala refined camphor and musk are used for putting on the urdhva pundram mark. This practice seems to have commenced from about 1465 A.D. The next item is the performance of the &ldquo;Mantrapushpam &quot; ritual. The riks, slokas and mantras recited in this connection are quite different from what is given in the Bhrigu or the Marichi Samhita and different also from what the
216
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
Pancharatra Padma Samhita gives or what Sri Ramanuja gives in his work &ldquo;Nityam.&rdquo; It is one which obviously was composed exclusively for Sri Venkateswara as His Murti Mantram. Bhrigu Samhita says,
&ldquo;Tadvishnoriti mantrēna pushpādyaih pujayēt tatah Mürtimantram samuchcharya kesavadibhire vavā Ashtottara sataistadvadashtottarasahsrakaih Anantairnämabhih pūjyo&rsquo; nantanāmā bhavan harih.&rdquo;
It was already stated that this unique composition was made so as to trace this archāvatar here direct from the Transcendental Being connoted by the Ashtakshara mantra and by the avatars of Sri Rama and Sri Krishna. Quotations from the works of Sri Nammāļvār, Sri Alavandar and Sri Ramanuja are also made&rsquo; The text of this mamantrapushpam is not given here as it might not be of interest to the reader.
A function known by the name &ldquo;Matradanam&rdquo; is included in the Bhrigu Samhita as the closing part of the Alankārāsanam. Although it is not mentioned in the Marichi samhita, which is presumed to regulate the details of worship in this temple, Matradānam is in vogue here. This takes place as part of the function known as koluvu.
Koluvu or Durbar.
The Alankäräsanam itself is a durbar held in the Sanctum Sanctorum. According to the description given in the Bhrigu Samhita the Matrādānam should take place there. It is however done outside the Sanctum Sanctorum in the Mukhamantapam (or Tirumamani mantapam). This deviation may be taken to indicate that maträdanam did not form a part of the ritual of worship in ancient days and that it is an innovation. &ldquo;Matradanam&rdquo; is the function in which a certain quantity of rice, gingelly seeds, betel leaves and nuts with some cash are given daily as a ration gift to the archakas. The Samhita says.
217

For this function &ldquo;koluvu Srinivasa&rdquo; (or the Bali Beram) is brought to the Tirumamani mantapam on a silver chair with silver umbrella and other paraphernalia. A laghu archana is conducted offering arghyam, padyam and achamaniyam. A mixture of powdered gingelly seeds, dried ginger powder and jaggery is offered to the deity and distributed to the congregation. The day&rsquo;s calendrical details are read out from the panchangam (almanac) and also an abstract account of the previous day&rsquo;s collection in the hundi, in the shape of coins, gold, jewellery etc. There is no reference to this function (nor to koluvu Srinivasa) in any of the inscriptions. When the British took over the administration of the Temple about 1800 A.D. and resumed all the temple lands it would have been considered fair to give an extra daily ration to the archakas for the loss of income sustained by them on account of the reduced tasdik which the Government allotted to the temple. The daily income was asked to be read out in public during koluvu and the extra ration to the archakas would also have been arranged to be given openly on the occasion.
SRINIVASA SAHASRANAMARCHANA.
This archana is a part of the routine puja, but one conducted for the material and spiritual welfare of individual devotees who pay special fees for the performance. This is performed only once after the Koluvu function is over. All those who have obtained tickets on payment of the prescribed fee are admitted into the Sanctum Sanctorum. The recital of the 1008 names of Sri Venkateswara is done. After the recital, general blessings are pronounced and the names and gotram of the ticket holders read out. Some people make a lumpsum endowment, the annual income there from being credited as the annual fee. There are
218
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
others who pay an annual compounded fee. But the majority pay for the individual archana. In other temples seperate archana done for each worshipper mentioning his or her name, gotram, etc., and the whole fee, or the major portion of it, is appropriated by the archaka. In Tirumala the archaka is paid by the Devasthanam a few annas for the extra service rendered. We are not certain if this archana was being performed in ancient days. The names recited in this archana are appropriate only to Sri Venkateswara whereas the usual Vishnu Sahasranamam is common to all Vishnu temples and is recited by almost all Hindus. The first mention of Sahasranama archana is in an inscription of the year 1518 A.D. (Jan.)&rsquo;. The Emperor Sri Virapratapa Vīra Achyuta Raya performed this archana personally, asking the archaka to stand aside and recite the names. More details are given in the chapter on Festivals. This function earns a lot of money for the Temple.
BHOJYASANAM OR NAIVEDYAM.
The Suddhi, or cleaning of the floor of the Garbhagriham would be done and all the cooked food would be transported to the Mukhamantapam (just in front of the Garbhagrilam) in large vessels called gangalams. These vessels are made to exact sizes called Solai, Half solai, etc., measures. The Bangāru Vākili doors (the outer doors of the Sanctum) are closed and the large twin bells in the Tirumamani Mantapam would set ringing with deafening noise. The archakas alone are allowed to remain within. All the others should walk out before the doors closeBhrigu Samhita says that before the cooked food or Havis is offered, &ldquo;Madhuparkam&rdquo; should be presented to the Murti. But Marichi</li>

219
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Samhita is silent on the point. An attempt was made in recent times to introduce &ldquo;Madhuparkam&rdquo; but was soon given up after a short life. The temple has its own traditions which could not be easily broken.
&ldquo;Havirarpanakālē tu na sevyō hariruchyatë.

HOMAM.
After the Neivedyam there is a Homam which is recommended to be performed three times a day, or at least once in connection with the morning puja. It does not appear to be performed in Tirumala.

YATRASANAM OR BALI OFFERING.
For offering Bali or food to all the devatas garrisoning the prākāras etc., in the temple the Bali Beram (Koluvu Srinivasa) should be taken out in a palanquin with full temple paraphernalia including music, dancers and songsters. Singing and dancing should be in the ragam, tālam and abhinayam presumed to be the beloved ones of each devata, and food, water and flowers offered. To some only water and flowers would be offered. The perambulation should be at least round the three prakarams or avaranams surrounding the Sanctum. In Tirumala however such a function does not appear to have ever been conducted. The reason would be obvious to readers who have gone through the earlier portions of this chapter. For one thing the temple is consecrated for a single Murti. The first avaranam stands mutilated. The archaka could not therefore locate or reach the spot where each devata would be presumed to be located. The procession therefore
220
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
does not take place. The archaka and the paricharaka go round the Vimana pradakshinam, offer Bali to Vishvaksena and Garuda in their respective shrines, then to the Dhvaja and Yūdadhipa and deposit the balance en masse on the five Bali stones placed between the Balipitam and the Dhvajam. Some seem to think that the archakas shirk the work. But what is being done is the only practicable and rational course to adopt.
According to the Pancharatra practice and the practice of Sri Vaishnavas in their houses, one fourth quantity of the cooked food should be set apart for Vishvaksena whose shrine is presumed to be in close proximity to the Dhruva Murti. But in Tirumala Vishvaksena gets no preference and has to wait till the archaka reaches his shrine during his pradakshinam. Sri Bhūtam who is presumed to have his seat on the sopanam of the Mukhamantapam inside the Sanctum gets his share deposited on the five stones near the Dhvajasthambham. Even the names of the devatas who are eligible to get food do not appear to be mentioned.
SATTUMURAI.
The word Sattumurai is used to designate the recitation of portions of the Tamil Prabandhams of the Alvars in the manner which custom and usage have stamped as inviolable. There is a prologue and an epilogue. These do not form an essential part of the Prabandham, but were coined several centuries after the days of Sri Ramanuja and at a time when the Sri Vaishnava community lost its homogeneity and got divided into two warring sections, even if at the commencement they did not mean to carry on an internecine war. The two sects are known as the Tengalais and Vadagalais. No further explanation is required to describe the two communities as the unceasing criminal and civil litigation carried on during the last century and half would have made these names very familiar to every one in South India. What Sri Ramanuja built with great care has been destroyed by his followers.
The prologue is known as the Pătram&rsquo; and is the real red rag. In simple terms the followers of a particular Acharya who flourished
221HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
some centuries after Ramanuja recite a sloka paying obeisance to that acharya. The epilogue is known as &ldquo;Vali Tirunamam &quot; (a) which phrase means &ldquo;long may his name live.&rdquo; (Some thing like &ldquo;long live the King.&rdquo;). Communities other than Sri Vaishnavas have no place in the Sanctum during this function as they do not and could not take part in the recitation of any portion of the three component parts. Women and children have by custom been wisely excluded so that they may not witness any possible unseemly squabbles.
Sri Vaishnavas headed by the Jiyyangar stream into the Sanctum soon after the Archaka returns thereto after offering Bali. Portions of the Prabandham commencing with the Patram and ending with the Vali Tirunāmām are recited. The congregation is then served with Tirtham, Saṭhāri, Chandanam and Prasadam, paying due heed to the order of precedence of the temple hierarchy. This function is not mentioned in any of the inscriptions and that means that to the end of the eighteenth century there was no such function. It therefore does not seem to have any antiquity behind it. The first mention of the Sattumurai of the Alwars is in an inscription of the year 1476 A.D. and the recital of the Prabandham in that year took place in front of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine and not inside the Sanctum Sanctorum. The subsequent adhyayanotsavam were celebrated in the Tirumamani Mantapam originally and in the Kalyana mantapam later. The Sattumurai function wherever performed is the exclusive right of the Sri Vaishnavas. The Madhyahna Puja (Tōmåla Seva) ends with the Sattumurai.
DHARMA DARSANAM.
A period of about an hour or more is then set apart for Dharma Darsanam (except perhaps on Fridays) which is for the benefit of pilgrims and worshippers who could not have had Darsan of the Deity during the previous functions for which payment has to be made. The conveniences and inconveniences experienced during the Dharma Darsanam have already been commented on. Then Suddhi takes place.
222
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
APARAHNA PUJA.
This is usually called the Second Bell. A shortened form of puja is conducted, the principal item being the second archana in an abbreviated form, although the fee to be paid is the same as for the first archana. A second Neivedyam then takes place heralded by the long continued ringing of the twin bells.
After the second bell the day&rsquo;s work is presumed to have ended and the box containing payments made by pilgrims within the Sanctum is brought over to the Parapatyadar and the doors closed.
NIGHT PUJA
The night Puja is similar to the morning Tōmāla seva. But it is strictly private and none but those who have a religious duty to perform are allowed to be present. The food offerings for the night are fewer and lighter in variety.
NIGHT DHARMA DARSANAM.
There is Dharma Darsanam during the night also except on Thursdays.
ARDHAJAMA PUJA.
The last function for the night is known as the Ardhajama or Nisi Puja. This is a laghu or abbreviated one and is meant more for offering sweets, payasam etc.,
PARYANKASANAM.
The Deity is put to bed. Bhoga Srinivasa is the Idol which plays the part except during the Mrigasira month. A velvet bed is laid out on a swing cot suspended by silver chains hanging from
223
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
a beam in the Mukhamantapam which is therefore called Sayana mantapam. The fee for admission to this Seva is heavier than for the others. The Seva is known as the Ekänthaseva. Boiled and sweetened milk, fruits, almond nuts etc., are offered to the Deity and a portion distributed among those present.
As was already mentioned two billas of perfumed chandanam are placed over the feet of the Dhruva Murti after removing the kavacham covering the feet. Perfumed chandanam (half a billa) is also placed on the chest of the Bhoga Srinivasa, a quarter billa for Alarmelmangai on the chest of the Dhruva Murti. A quarter billa is left for the night puja by Brahma. These details are not to be found in any inscription. The practice however seems to be a long established one.
The two queens of Sri Krishna Deva Maharaya (Chinnaji Devi and Tirumala Devi) presented each a gold cup weighing 374 thukams for offering milk during this seva (1513 A.D.). Obala Nayakkar Rama Nayakkar, one of the generals of Krishna Devaraya presented two hundred cows (1514 A.D.) for offering one nāļi or measure of well boiled or paledu Kulambu for Ardhajāma Seva. This is a thick preparation of sweetened and spiced milk.
THURSDAY PULANGI SEVA.
On every Thursday after the midday puja is over the Dhruva Murti is divested of all ornaments, flowers etc., and is given a light dressing of dhoti and uttariyam. The Tirumankappu and the Kasturi mark are scraped down leaving only a slight trace. The second bell naivedyam then takes place and the doors close. In the evening after the opening of the doors suddhi is performed and from the Yamunatturai are brought with temple music ali the flower garlands specially prepared for decorating the Murti This decoration exclusively with flowers is called Pulangi Seva When and why this arrangement was made we do not know. But in the description of the Murti given in the Silappadhikaram this seva is described in the following words.
224
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
பொலம்பூ வாடையிற் பொலிந்து தோன்றிய செங்கண் நெடியோன்.&rdquo;
The Tamil expression. H&quot; Pavadai&rsquo; is the literal equivalent of the Telugu &ldquo;Pulangi.&rdquo; We are therefore certain that about the year 756 A.D. this seva exclusively with flowers was current. But whether it was a daily feature or one on Thursdays only we do not know. It may however be stated that it is a preliminary operation for preparing the Mürti for the abhishekam on Friday, the next day. It would be a tedious task to remove all tiruvabharanams, clothing etc., on Friday itself before performing the abhishekam. The Murti is therefore divested of all these on Thursday.
FRIDAY TIRUMANJANAM
(Abhishekam)
AND PULUGUKKAPPU.
The Friday Abhishekam is for the Dhruva Murti since he does not get a bath every day. Pulugukkäppu simply means the application of or anointing with prepared civet oil which is called Meditta pulugu (Quss46). The application of this scented oil over the entire body of the Murti is of recent origin. The Friday Abhishekam however appears to be more ancient. It was already suggested in Chapter VII that in connection with the abhishekam and consecration of Bhoga Srinivasa (or Manavalapperumal) an abhishekam would have been done for the Dhruva Murti also since the occasion was a unique incident in the history of the temple. That day happened to be a Friday and on subsequent Fridays or other Fridays coinciding with a festival day the Dhruva Murti would have received an abhishekam. The appliction of civet oil or Meditta Pulugukkäppu seems to have had its origin in an endowment1 made by Mudaliyar Thirukkalikanri Däsar Alagappirănăr one item of which was the supply of this scented oil (மொதித்த புழுகுக்காப்பு) )to be applied every day to the face</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of the Dhruva Murti during the six months of the Dakshinayanam commencing from the first day of the month of Adi (Katakam) to the end of the month of Margali (Dhanus). It may be pointed out here that the whole body was not anointed nor was the application made all round the year. The current practice is to apply the civet oil daily to the feet and not to the face. The use of civet or Punugu (by which was meant the exudation from the pouch of the live rivet cat) for perfuming the articles of worship was introduced by Devaraya Maharaya in 1429 A.D. (I. 192;). It is not the same substance as civet oil.
Why the application of civet oil was thought of it is difficult to find out. We know however that in certain temples oil extracted from sandal wood (Chandanadi tailam) is applied to the Müla Murti perhaps as a preservative and also to keep off cocroaches and other insect pests. This is however done only once a year. Civet oil is extracted by killing a large number of civet cats. The process is not the same as for the collection of civet as perfume From an endowment made in 1496 A.D. (II. 136) by Kandadai Appachi Anna Ayyangar, we learn that on every alternate Friday Pulugukkäppu was applied. This endowment was for food offering in connection with the function. When the application of civet oil for the whole body commenced we cannot say. Since Alagappiränar made his endowment in 1434 A.D. and Appachi Anna Ayyangar made his in 1496 A.D. the practice should have commenced sometime during the intervening period. From an inscription of the year 15061 we learn that the application of Pulugukappu after the abhishekam was for the Dhruva Murti only and that Alarmelmangai Nachchiyar was having only the abhishekam. This is also the current practice.
The Pulugukkappu murai and the Friday abhishekam however became a weekly function during the days of Sri Krishna Devaraya</li>

Mahārāya (III 80; 1517 A.D.). He set apart the sunkam (oo) of one thousand varahams from Gudagur Nadu for pulugukkappu on every eighth day (2328 o ). We might therefore state that the weekly Friday Tirumanjanam commenced only in January 1517 A.D. The inscription does not give details of the articles used for the function. A detailed enumeration of these is given in an inscription of the year 1583 A.D. (VI. 5) which records an endowment made by Ettur Tirumalai Kumāratātāchariar. The details are:-
Gambura
Civet Bags
Rose water vessels
Saffron
4 kudiram
(1 kudiram-210 varaham weight)
200
12
30 pana weight.
White cloth for face..
1 (selai).
Note:-Kasturi and turmeric paste which are included in the current practice do not find place in the above list.
The weekly Friday abhishekam is now an arjitam function for the performance of which pilgrims make payment, carry in procession round the sanctum as a mark of honour the perfumed articles for which they paid and deliver the same inside the sanctum sanctorum. The abhishekam is done not only for the Dhruva Murti but also for the Goddess Alarmel Mangai Nachchiyar who stands on the bosom of the Dhruva Murti. It is therefore necessary to dilate a little on its details. The articles now being used in this connection are:-
Gambura or Pachchai Karpüram-3 Kuchcha seers (84 tola weight).
Civet bags (4L)-7 K. seers (=1} viss). Saffron (Kunkumappu)-1 K. seers (36 tola weight). Kasturi (musk)-3 varahan weight.
Turmeric pasteK. seer.

It does not appear that in the early days turmeric paste was used in connection with the Friday function although it was used
227
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
daily for, the abhishekam of the Kautuka Bēram (Bhōga Srinivasa). The latter was first introduced by Kandadai Ramanuja Iyengar in 1465 A.D. On that date there was not an Alarmel Mangai Nachchiyar on the bosom of the Dhruva Murti. She first comes to notice in an inscription dated 22-5-1477 A.D. (Vol. II. 69) when a Sandhi food offering was instituted for her. Her name occurs again in II. 134 dated 31-8-1495 A.D. It is however from an inscription dated 21-12-1496 (Vol. II 136). that we learn that she shared the food offering after the Puļugukkappu on every alternative Friday. From an inscription III. 4 dated 1-3-1506 we learn that she receives Her abhishekam after the Dhruva Murti has had his abhishekam and puļugukkappu. This is also the current practice. The Turmeric Paste ( kuchcha seer) is intended for Her abhishekam only. In 1583 Sri Kumara Tatachariar did not however provide turmeric paste. The larger quantity of saffron in his endowment probably includes what was required for the Nachchiar&rsquo;s abhishekam also. All these details are gone into with a view to remove the misapprehension of some people that turmeric paste is used for the Dhruva Murti and that therefore the Murti is really a female deity.
GAMBURA OR PACHCHAI KARPURAM.
Gambura or Pachchai karpuram and Kasturi are both used for the toilet after the abhishekam and the Pulugukkappu. This toilet is called Tirumankappu or putting on the Urdhva pundram for the Dhruva Murti. This as we have seen is not an ancient practice, but commenced from about the middle of the 15th century. It was first used for the Utsava Murti. For we find in an inscription of the year 1380 A.D. that for the Tirumanajanam of the year 1380 A.D. that for the Tirumanjanam of Malaiyappan and the Nachchiyars gingily oil 1 ollock, chandanakkappu 1 palams, kastürikkappu, karpurakkappu and kumkumakkappu were supplied. The use of Pachchakarpuram and kasturi might have commenced then. A few words might be said about pachchaikarpuram and kasturi. While chudan karpuram or crude camphor used for hāratti is mentioned from about 1000 A.D. the use of refined camphor is mentioned only in 1380 A.D. The presumption is</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>22 (18-1-1465 A.D.).
228
NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
that its use as an article of toilet and in the water used for the Puja is of much later date. There are said to be three varieties of camphor,1 viz. (1) Formosa Camphor; (2) Borneo Camphor known as Bhimsenikarpur (3) Blumea camphor. The second variety is Pachchaikarpuram so highly priced. It is said to be formed in the stems of the Camphora plant grown in Dutch Sumatra. As this substance is largely used in the Sanctum Sanctorum and as camphor is a very inflammable substance, the practice in Tirumala is to offer the camphor haratti and straight away put it into water so that there may be no room given for anything to catch fire.
KASTURI.
Kasturi:-The Kasturi in use is also known as Mriganābhi in Sanskrit (English Musk). It is an &ldquo;inspissated and dried secretion from the preputial follicles of the musk animal found generally in China, Russia, Assam, Central Asia and in the inaccessible cliffs of the Himalayas.&rdquo; There are said to be three varieties of musk: (1) Kamrupa of black colour and superior quality coming probably from China and Tibet. (2) Nepal musk of bluish colour and intermediate quality; (3) Kashmir musk of inferior quality. Musk (or Kasturi) is therefore an animal substance. There is however another Kasturi plant which grows erect in the Punjab, Himalayas and western Tibet. The leaves of this have a strong scent of musk and are offered to idols. This leaf might therefore be the one which according to the sastras should be offered to Vishnu to be placed on the forehead as Urdhva pundra or Tilaka. This statement is only a presumption of the writer, since it would be highly improper to place an animal secretion on the forehead of a Deity who is being universally worshipped. It is a puzzle how religiously minded people tolerate the use of this on the forehead of the Deity.
CIVET OIL (Pulugukkappu) AND ROSE WATER.
It is likewise a matter for wonder as to how rose water and civet oil were allowed to be used on the Deity. For abhishekam</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
water has to be supplied only by Sri Vaishnava Brahmins. But rose water is prepared generally by Non-Hindus such as Persians and Muslims. And civet oil is prepared by soaking civet bags (said to be the pouch of the civet cat, situated between the anus and the genital organs, usually taken after killing the cat) in gingly oil and allowing the secretion contained in the pouch to exude into the oil by pressing while hot. The term pulugu itself explains the process as one of making the civet pouch to sweat out the unctuous secretion. In any case it is an animal secretion obtained after dealing with the animal in a violent manner. We and our forbears of the 15th century have reconciled ourselves to the propriety of its use as a toilet for the Dhruva Murti. This civet oil is smeared all over the body of the Murti after abhishekams with saffron water (Kumkumappukkappu) and then again with clean water. The Murti is wiped dry with cloth before the smearing is done with the oil.
As already mentioned the tirumankkappu is put on soon after the abhishekam of Alarmelmangai Nachchiyar is conducted with turmeric water. These are strictly private functions. The above is the procedure for the Friday abhishekam and Pulugukkappu murai which is really composed of four different functions: namely the abhishekam of the Dhruva Murti; the application of Pulugukkappu; the abhishekam of the Nachchiar and the toilet called Tirumankappu. After these are done the decoration of the Dhruva Murti takes place with clothing, all abharanams, etc.
FOOD OFFERINGS.
In connection with the Friday abhishekam there have been endowments made for food offerings during the second bell. Appachchi Ayyangar in 1496 A.D. made provision for two athirasappadi. One Sittamu Setty endowed in 1506 A.D. for one Nayaga taligai and one appappadi. One Bandaram Siruthimmaiya endowed in 1534 A.D. for one vadaippadi. Rayasam Konappaiyer endowed in 1558 A.D. for two atirasappadi and Kumara Tatachariar provided in his endowment of 1583 A.D. for offering one appappadi, one
230
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
vadaipadi one godippadi and one iḍdilippadi. It will thus be seen that different kinds of food offerings were made and there will be no justification for drawing an inference from these, as some people do, that the deity is female because vadaippadi was offered at one time.
THE FRIDAY ABHISHEKAM WATER
(Tirumanjana Tirtham)
The kneaded paste of saffron is applied to the face etc., of the Dhruva Murti and when the abhishekam is done with water the first take-off is a more concentrated solution of the saffron, traces of gambura and civet oil. This water is usually appropriated by the archakas who may be sharing it with the Jiyyangar and the Parapatyadar of the Devasthanam. The others only get the water from the subsequent take-off. This tirumanjana tirtham is a highly prized prasādam. Along with this a quantity of the sweet cake offering called Põli, is sent down the hill to Tirupati distributed to the principal officers of the Devasthanam and to some local Government officials. Pilgrims and residents of Tirupati also try to get a few spoonfuls of this water from the Brahmin who makes the distribution. As the water will keep for some days it is sent to other places also. This practice has since been stopped.
(Sripadarenu.)
The Gambura or Pachchai Karpuram and Kasturi removed from the face of the Dhruva Murti are mixed with the civet oil which is collected from near the feet of the Murti and well kneaded by hand by the Jiyyangar. The resulting stuff is weighed and distribution made among those of the religious hierarchy of the Temple who might be present, after setting apart the Devasthanam&rsquo;s share. A small quantity is intended for distribution to the pilgrims (or desantaries) present. What remains which invariably is the biggest ball is appropriated by the Jiyyangar according to usage. This is called &ldquo;Kaimidi&rdquo; (what is left on the hand). This Srīpāda renu is a greatly valued prasādam and is a lucrative article of trade.
231NITYARCHANA IN THE TIRUMALA TEMPLE
Spurious mixtures are therefore made in Tirumala and sold as Srivari prasadam.
OBSERVATION.
Saffron (Agnisikha, Kumkuma).
It is worth pointing out that kneaded saffron paste as an article for abhishekam is not contemplated in any of the Agamas. The herb is a native of Levant in Asia Minor (now cultivated on a small scale in Kashmir). As an article of commerce it would have come into use after the Portugese commenced their trading with the East in the 16th century. All the inscriptions up to the beginning of the sixteenth century A.D. mention only chandana kappu for abhishekam. Medicinally saffron is said to be used in small doses in fevers, melancholia, enlargement of the liver and in spasmodic cough and asthma and also for flatulant colic.&rsquo;
Refined camphor (Pachchaikarpur) which is also an imported article mostly from Borneo would have come freely into the market late in the fifteenth or early in in 16th century A.D. Ordinary camphor was more common. The use of refined camphor for the Urdhva pundram would therefore have had a very late origin. It is not mentioned in the early inscriptions nor in the agamas.</li>

NOTE ON THE SPICES AND OTHER ARTICLES
USED IN THE PUJA-PATRAMS OR VESSELS.
Although the current practice in Tirumala does not appear to be in consonance with the instructions given in the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra agamas, and in &ldquo;The Nityam&rdquo; of Sri Ramanuja, the instructions given in the Agamas will be mentioned for the information of the readers. This will furnish one more instance to show that in this temple even the Vaikhanasa acharam is not necessarily followed and that the temple developed its own usage and custom.
Five large cups or vattils are invariably in use for a regular puja. These vessels are given distinctive names, viz., arghya, pādya, āchamaniya, and snaniya pătrams which are placed in the south-east, south-west, north-east and north-west corners on a large circular gold, silver or copper plate standing on a tripod. The fifth cup, or vattil in the centre is for sarvarthatoyam (general purposes water). In the other four vattils certain herbs and spices are put in along with the water so as to produce a cold infustion. What these ingredients are will now be given.
PUJA DRAVYAM OR MATERIALS USED FOR PUJA
The vessels used as also the other metallic articles such as the bell, plates for offering haratti, the perforated plate for giving shower bath (Sahasradhāra) etc., are included in the term puja dravyam. In this note however it is proposed to confine our attention to the herbs, spices and other articles which are put into the waters used for the purja.
In the conduct of the puja cretain upacharas or respectful observances are ordained. According to Hindu customs, the proper manner of receiving even an ordinary visitor is to offer water for washing the hand (Arghaym), then for washing the feet (Pädyam), then for washing the mouth and drinking (àchamaniyam); and fourthly water for taking a bath (snäniyam). It is only after having
233
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the bath and after having the toilet done (alankaram) that the guest is invited to have his meal (Bhojanam) This procedure is observed in doing puja to the deity also. For this purpose four suitable cups, called in Tamil vattils, are used for holding water and are named according to the purposes above mentioned and the fifth one in the centre. Besides these five there will be a larger one of a special shape called Pratigraha patram. Its purpose will be presently
seen.
Drugs and spices which should be put into the respective cups.
Before commencing the actual puja, the vesels, water and all the other materials go through a purificatory tantric process. The five cups are filled with the sanctified water and the spices etc., are put into the vessels as will be detailed presently. The Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra Agamas give the details which are intended to be adopted in Temple Worship. Sri Ramanuja in his work on the subject of puja known as &ldquo;Nityam&rdquo; also makes his recommendations which are mainly intended for adoption by Grihastas in their home puja. It needs no saying that in every Hindu houses a daily puja used to be performed in a suitable manner although modern conditions of life have largely liquidated this. Some rich people employ a purohit who does it for remuneration. Ramanuja&rsquo;s recommendations embody in substance what is contained in the Agama Samhitas. The Samhitas are numerous; for our purposes however, the Bhrugu Samhita representing the usual Vaikhanasa practice, the Padma Samhita representing the pancharatra practice and the Marichi Samhita presumed to represent the Tirumala Temple practice will be tabulated and examined in addition to the Ramanuja practice. This examination will be instructive in view of the fact that the current practice in the Tirumala Temple is divergent from all the above. This divergence could not have been an ancient practice since the tradition is that Sri Ramanuja played a great part in framing correct rules for worship in all the temples. Even the Marichi Samhita recommends the soaking of certain herbs, grasses and grains in the waters of the puja pātram, although it mentions their names in a compact and compendious manner. But as the spoonful of water offered whether as Arghya,
234
ARTICLES USED IN THE PUJA PATRAMS
Pädya, or Achamaniya is at once put into the same Pratigraha patram and as the Snaniya water also gets into the same pătram it does not matter to the worshipper how the herbs, etc., are distributed in the four cups. Before mentioning the names of these article and their specific medicinal values, it may be stated that Hindus who have strong faith in temple worship as well as in the individual idol worship at home implicitily believe that all oilments of the flesh due to the disturbance in the tridosha(Pitta, Vayu and Sleshma) are effectually cured by the continued taking in of consecrated puja water. It is not only the psychological effect due to this belief, but also the medicinal values of the herbs soaked into the water that give relief to the sufferer. How these herbs are distribued in the different vessels according to recommendations of the two systems of Agamas is shown in the subjoined table. In some cases the same article finds place in more than one vessel which only means that a stronger infusion of the water is made with that herb.
Compendiously the articles so used for making a cold infusion are the following:-
Vrihi (Rice), Yava (Wheat), Tila, (gingily), Masha (black gram), Priyangu (Valmilagu or tailpepper), Siddrärtha (Whitemustard or Nayi Kadugu), Kusagram (tips of kus grass), Akshata1, Gandha, (Sandal wood pieces) Pushpa (Flowers); Vishnu parni or Vishnu krantham: Padma Dalam; Dürvam (Grass), Syāmākam (Thenai or korra), Usiram (Khus-Khus), Thakkolam, Elam., Lavangam Karpūram, Jāti (Jasmin), Pushpam, Lamajjaka, the two turmerics, Mūra (Maruth kilangu), Saileya (Lavangapattai), Champaka, Koshtamansi (Kuriviver or Musk root).
Each of the above has its own properties and medicanil value. It is however needless to enter into their virtues in detail here. Those who have a desire to have detailed information would do well to refer to &ldquo;Indian Materia Medica&rdquo; by K.M. Nadkarni1,</li>
<li>Both akshata and vrihi are mentioned in the same breath in the Bhrigu samhita. Akshata is probably the same as Aksröta or Akrōt.</li>
<li>Short notes are given at the end.
235
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The diseases which the collective infusion might be meant to cure are epilepsy, hysteria, flatulence, dysentery, menorrhabia, bleeding of piles, vomitting, bowel complaints, fevers attended with diarrhoea or indigestion, pain of parturition, giddiness caused by biliousness, gastric and intestinal pains. gout, rheumatism, cholera, intermittent fevers attended with inflamation and irritability of the stomach, dyspepsia, fevers accompanied by bilious symptoms, enlargement of spleen and lever, gonorrhoea, heart disease, itch, leprosy, glandular enlargements, typhoid fever, bad teeth and foul breath, palpitation of the heart, nervous headache, chorea, menstrual disturbances, hysterio epilepsy and similar convulsive ailments and generally for the promotion of appetite and maintaining proper functioning of the various organs.
Unfortunately in Tirumala, these herbs are not used. The Marichi Samhita which is presumed to have been specially composed for this Temple gives compendious list of the articles to be used for infusion:-&ldquo;Tanḍula, Vrihi, (Yava), Masha, Sarshapa, Misramakshatam&rdquo; i.e., a mixture of rice, wheat, blackgram and mustard, also Siddhārtam, Tilam, Kusagram (Dadhi, Ksheeram, Gritham). It is probable that owing to the temple being on an inaccessible hill the daily puja could not have been carried on in the early days in the elaborate manner given in the Bhrigu and the Padma Samhitas. But when Sri Ramanuja about 1100 A.D. reorganised the system of worship on a satisfactory basis, he would not have failed to introduce the use of the herbs recommended by the Agamas and by himself in his Nityam. In the course of centuries strict observance does not appear to have been insisted on. The result has been that the current practice is something entirely different from all the previous ones. Refined camphor and saffron are the articles in current use for the puja pātrams as well as for the Friday Abhishakam. These two could have come into general use only after they became articles of commerce and trade between Asia Minor, Malaya, Borneo, China and South India. Such trade would have flourished only after the advent of Vasco-de-Gama to the East.
It is a subject deserving consideration whether the herbs which have been in use in the past as the result of experience to safeguard the health and the lives of the worshippers should not be reintroduced.

SHORT NOTES ON THE PROPERTIES AND MEDICINAL VALUES OF SOME OF THE DRAVYAM OR OSHADHI, USED IN
THE PUJA-PATRAM WATERS
FOR A COLD INFUSION.
Vrihi is rice:-Water in which unboiled rice is soaked is known as Tanḍulambu. This water is used as a vehicle for some powders and also for washing ulcers and wounds.
Yava is Wheat.-It has three outer skins besides the three inner portions. The outermost skin is fibrous and excites mechanical action in the stomach resulting in digestion of food. The next two skins contain acids and salts which produce bone, hair and teeth. Yava is the name used for barley also, but less frequently.
Tila is gingelly seeds or Sesanum:-There are three varieties black, white and red. The black one is the best for medicinal purposes. The seeds are specially useful in piles and constipation.
238
ARTICLES USED IN THE PUJA PATRAMS
Masha is ulundu (Tamil); minimu (Telugu) black-gram:-It is the most demulcent, cooling as well as nutritious of all pulses; also aphrodisiac and nervine tonic. Medicinally it is used internally in gastric cattarrah dysentery, diarrheoea, cystolis, paralysis, piles&rsquo; rheumatism, and affections of the liver and the nervous system.
Priynagu:-a Sanskrit dictionary for Vaidika terms gives this as representing Manjal (turmeric) Kunkumum, Valmilagu (tail pepper) or Tippili(long pepper). As turmeric and Kumkumum are referred to separately, tail pepper or vālmilaku is meant here. It is used as a carminative spice in diseases of the genito urinary organs. It produces tension of the vocal cords and clears the throat of the tenacious mucus.
Siddhartha:-white mustard, G. In small doses it promotes digestion and removes flatus.
Kusa grass:-Dürva; an infusion of its herb is used as diuretic and astringent.
Durvam:-Arugampul (Tamil) garike (Telugu) cold infusion stops bleeding of piles.
Akshata:-This could not mean the akshata which is rice mixed with a little turmeric powder, since both rice and turmeric are separately mentioned as puja dravyam. It is probably an incorrect rendering of the word Akshōta which is the Sanskrit name for Akrot which grows wild in the Himalayas, and cultivated in Kashmir, Tibet and Afghanistan. The husks of the fruit, or pericarp possess vermifuge and antisyphilitic properties. The ripe fruit possesses aphrodisiac properties.
Gandham:-This is the same as Srigandham.
The term Gandham in Sanskrit is used for Sitaphal and sandal wood or Srigandham or Chandanam. The astringent bark of Sitaphal is said to be used as a tonic. We have to assume that by Gandham Srigandham is meant. The wood is cooling, sedative and astringent. Medicinally sandalwood is useful in bilious fevers. The powder of the wood taken in cocoanut water checks thirst. It is also a specific for gonorrhoea.
239
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Vishauparni or Vishnukranta:-The herb is used medicinally in the form of an Infusion. It is a sovereign remedy in bowel complaints and in fevers attended with diarrhoea or indigestion.

Syamakam:-Tenai (Tamil); Korra (Telugu).
Italian millet (English). It is diuretic and astringent. A popular domestic remedy for alleviating pains of porturation. It has heating properties and if taken solely as food is likely to produce diarrhoea.
Usiram:-(cuscus grass) Vettiver (Tamil) Kurver (Telugu). Tonic, stimulant, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, diuretic and emmenagogue. Being a cooling medicine, it is in the form of infusion a grateful drink in fevers, inflammations and irritability of stomach.
Takkolam:-It is not known if it is the same as Takoli (Dalbergia Lanceslaria, or D. Froudosa). The bark, the leaves and the roots are employed medicinally.
Elam:-Truti (Sanskrit), cardamum. Powerful aromatic, stimulant, carminative, and diuretic. Valuable in many stomach complaints, used for relieving giddiness caused by biliousness.
Lavangam:-Cloves. It is a stomachic, carminative, aromatic and antispasmodic. Internally increases circulation, raises blood heat, promotes digestion of fatty and crude food, promotes nutrition and relieves gastric and intestinal pains and spasm. Stimulates the skin, salivary glands, kidneys, liver and bronchial mucus membrane. Relieves flatulence.

Infusion useful for dyspepsia, flatulence, diarrhoea and vomitting. As a powerful stimulant cinnamon is given in cramps of the stomach, enteralgia, tooth ache and paralysis of the tongue. As germicide it is used internally in typhoid fever. It strengthens the gums and perfumes the breath.
Jatamansi (Sans. Tamil, Telugu):-Musk root.
Aromatic tonic, nerve stimulant, antispasmodic, deoles truent, duiretic, emmanagogue, sedative to the spinal cord. Promotes appetite and digestion. Employed in the treatment of hysterical affections, especially palpitation of the heart; nervous headache, chorea, flatulence, etc Useful also in menopause disturbance, hysteroepilpsy, and similar and convulsive ailments.
Karpuram:-(Camphor) Diaphoretic, stimulant, antiseptic, antispasmodic, expectorant, sedative, temporary aphrodisiac and narcotic. It exhilarates in moderate doses and raises the pulse without producing febrile symptoms; promotes perspiration and sometimes induces sleep.
Koshtam (costus English) Gostam (Tamil):-The powdered root is used. It is a tonic, alterative, anti spasmodic, and aphrodisiac; as aromatic stimulant in the form of infusion with a little cardamom is used in coughs, asthma, chronic rheumatism and skin diseases, fever and dyspepsia.

CHAPTER X.
TIRUPATI AND SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE.
AFTER the downfall of the Pallavas and with the advent of the
Chola power Saivism grew in importance and the Vaishnavites to whom the worship of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan was all important thought it prudent to abandon gradually the substitute Tiruvilankōil at Tiruchchukanür and transfer their activities to Tirumala itself in spite of the difficulties which the pilgrims might have had to undergo. Their object was to avoid all possibilities of a conflict with the growing influential Saivite community in the temple of Parasaresvara in Tiruchchukanür. That was possibly one of the reasons for Samavai&rsquo;s consecrating the silver image of Manavālapperumal (Bhoga Srinivasa) in the Tiruvengadam temple in 966 A.D. There might have been another reason also. The Tiruvilankoyilperuman, the Tirumantrasalai Peruman and even the Tiruvengaḍattupperumānaḍigal in Tiruchchukanür were all proxies of the God in Tirumala and were all probably consecrated not according to the Vaikhanasa but according to the sister constitution of the Pancharatra to which Sri Alavandar and his ancestors adhered Therefore it must have been feared that even the temples at Tirumala and Tiruchchukanur must some day or other come into conflict with each other. It seems therefore to have been decided that the activities of the Sri Vaishnavas should be transferred to Tirumala itself. There was however the practical difficulty to overcome in the matter of offering daily abhishekam to the Dhruva Mürti whose size was too large. The installation of a silver Replica of Tiruvengadamudaiyan (Bhoga Srinivasa) in Tirumala obviated such difficulties. To provide for the daily puja including Nivedanam of this Murti Samavai purchased outright some of the lands belonging to the Tiruchchukanur Tiruvilankōyil and also some lands from the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanür. The management of the property and the performance of the Kainkaryams were left to the managers of the Tirumala temple. Thus no
243
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
room was left for any possible future conflict between the Vaikhanasa temple at Tirumala and the Pancharatra one at Tiruchchukanur. We however find that even as late as 1234 A.D. (No. 40 Vol. I) the hall of the latter continued to be the meeting place for the Sabhaiyar and the Naṭṭārs on important occasions. But the Tiruchchukanur Tiruvilankoyil of Tiruvengadamudaiyan ceased to exist or sank into insignificance. And this may be inferred from the fact that the last endowment therefore was somewhere about 1000 A.D. during the reign of Raja Raja I. (Vol. I. 17) by one Raja Rajamüvendavelan. The next endowment for a Vishnu Temple in Tiruchchukanur was about the year 1220 A. D. in the 4th year of the reign of Raja Raja.III;but it was for an Alagiyaperumal temple by one Pōkkaran Pandyadarayan.
To the pilgrim however, the difficulties of pilgrimage must have become greater. Before 966 A.D. such of the piglrims as could not afford to ascend the hill after a ten mile walk from Tiruchchukanur were content with worshipping the proxy Gods in the latter place, and also offering worship at the foot of the hill without ascending it. After the installation of the silver Murti in Tirumala they necessarily had to ascend the hill. The founding of a new village nearer to the foot of the hill having a claim to sanctity was therefore necessary if pilgrimage to Tirumala was to be encouraged. The only such village with a name to boast of was Kottur. In the southern part of this village there seems to have existed a temple dedicated to Sri Parthasarathy Swami near which would have resided the family or families of the Archakas who were doing worship in the Tirumala Temple.
THE FOUNDING OF TIRUPATI.
When about 1130 A. D. Sri Ramanuja (the disciple of Sri Alavandar and the nephew of Tirumala Nambi) was hard put to finding a place for installing the image of Sri Govindaraja which was externed by the Chola king from the Chidambaram Temple, he must have thought of the site of this Parthasarathy Shrine as the most appropriate one. This Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s idol was an
244
TIRUPATI AND SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
ancient one of Chidambaram whose installation at the foot of the Tirumalai Hill would appeal to the spiritual instincts of the Sri Vaishnava pilgrims. They could make a day or a night halt, partake with propriety such food as the temple could offer, have a bath in the Alvar Tirtham at the foot of the Hill and ascend the seven hills of Tirumala. Thus after an interval of about a century and three quarters from the date of installation in Tirumala of Manavalapperumal Tirupati was ushered in by Sri Ramanuja (so the tradition says). It was planned by him with the four Rājavīdhis, a north Maḍa Street (known at the time as time as Ayyengar Tiruvidhi) and a Sannidhi Street. It was named Ramanujapuram. There is no inscription to tell us what the plan and elevation of the temple in Tirupati looked like at the time. Nor have we any inscription to show the exact year of its construction. From the fact that the shrine of Sri Ramanuja in Tirupati bears an inscription on its west and south base referring to the year 1224 A. D. and that the shrine stands outside the inner gopuram of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple-next to the Shrine of his uncle Sri Tirumala Nambi-we have to infer that the inner gopuram and prakaram of the Tirupati Temple were built along with the main shrine during Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s life time. This inscription in Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine also tells us, that the daily lighting and flowers for the shrine were the charity of his disciples, showing thereby that it might not have been an integral part of Sri Govind -raja&rsquo;s temple. It always had a separate Kartar or manager as in the case of Tirumala Nambi&rsquo;s temple. As Sri Parthasarathy Shrine had been consecrated according to the Vaikhanasa agama, the consecration of Sri Govindaraja at a later date followed the same agama. This temple and the small settlement around it however compare unfavourably with Tiruchchukanur village and its temples. There in Tiruchchukanür we have the Svarnamukhi river and spring channels; and the village was reputed to have as residents a Sabhaiyar of over 108 learned Sri Vaishnava families. Making Tirupati a flourishing village was therefore not an easy matter. It consequently seems to have been made obligatory on every Srivaishnava who was in anyway connected with the Tirumala temple to own property and to reside in Tirupati. The families of the Vaikhanasa Archakas, the Acharyapurusha, the temple servants and the merchants who suppiled provisions to the
245
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
temple were thus obliged to reside in the new settlement. An inscription bears evidence to this.
The popularity of this new temple would naturally have been in proportion to its financial resources, about which we have no definite information. In 1219 A.D. the queen of Vira Narasingayadavaraya presented 32 cows and one bull to provide ghee for one Tirunandavilakku (perpetual light) daily before Sri Govindaraja. From I. 40 (1234 A.D.) we also gather that the management of this temple was in the hands of the managers of the Tirumala temple, but that it had a separate account of income and expenditure. From I. 86 (1234 A.D.) we further learn that the Yadava Nächchiyar (or queen )of Vira Narasinga made over the second half of Payindipalli village as sarvamanya for Sri Govindaraja (the first half having already become the property of Tiruvengadamudaiyan). The income from this village was to be used for the new Ani Brahmottsavam instituted by her, for the preparation of a golden Sikharam for the four faced car newly constructed by her for the God and for its repairs. Any balance that might be left over was to be utilised for improvements of the temple of Sri Govindaraja. We conclude from this that the temple from the commencement had separate assets to meet the cost of its amudupadi and sattupadi. The temple tastik should have been very limited; and when pilgrimage became heavy as during festivils, private charity had to come in to augment the normal tastik prasādams. Thus(I. 61. 1254 A.D.) we are told that some devotees made permanent arrangement in 1254 A.D. for the daily supply of eleven tumbu of rice per day from the second day to the end of the Vaikasi festival. This would have sufficed for about 80 to 100 pilgrims per day. Some residents of Nerku village made permanent arrangements in 1308 A.D. for the feeding of a limited number of Srivaishnava pilgrims resorting to the place on certain special days, such as Kaisika dvādasi, Mukkotidvadasi, Makara Sankramanam etc. Such small endowments go to show that enough prasadams were not available in the temple to feed pilgrims. There were no Ramanujakūtams, choultries or matams in those days. It took at least one more century for such institutions to rise along with the growth in pilgrim traffic. The growth of Tirupati in size and importance was in proportion to the volume of this pilgrim traffic.

TIRUPATI AND, SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
THE BUILDING OF SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S SHRINE.
It is designedly called here Govindarajā&rsquo;s shrine and not His Temple. There was already a temple of Sri Parthasarathy on the spot and it is not improbable that the gopuram was the one attached to it. This Gopuram is what we now call the inner gopuram. The town of Tirupati had to be formed anew. The word Tirupati, to denote the name of the place, came into use only after Sri Ramanuja planned and gave that name. It might have been a part of the village of Köttür originally as already surmised. Sri Ramanuja took it on himself to see that a regular town came into existence and so named it Tirupati-a Tamil name. The portion of the town surrounding the temple came to be known as Ramanujapuram. Somewhere about the same time the Chola King ordered that Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s Utsava Murti in Chidambaram should be thrown into the sea, as Vishnu&rsquo;s place of Sayanam (resting) was the ocean. This order is believed to be that of Kulothunga I, since we know from traditions that one of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s disciples Kūratālvān behaved impudently before the King by giving a reply to the statement &ldquo;Sivāt parataram nāsti &ldquo;saying that the measure &lsquo;Dronam&rsquo; was bigger than Sivam.&rsquo; The King&rsquo;s Order to expel the image of Govindaraja from Chidambaram would have been an act of reprisal. We also know that Sri Ramanuja and his disciples forsook the Chola country and found asylum in the Hoysala country fo nearly a quarter of a century till the death of Kulothunga 1 took place in 1120 A.D. So the building of a shrine for Sri Govindaraja should have taken place after 1120 A.D. The idol seems to have been kept in safety in Tirupati during the interval. That the temple was not built exclusively for Sri Govindaraja but only formed an adjunct to the shrine of Sri Parthasarathy, is obvious from a look of the site of the temple as it now stands. There is no rain gateway or gopuram in front of the doorway of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s shrine.
About the year of construction, Dr. S. Krishnaswami Iyengar in his history of Tirupati (Vol. I. Chap. XI) has gone into much speculation based on vague statements contained in the Guruparampara and the Itihasamāla accounts. He had even to assume
247
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
that Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s life period was from 1050 to 1150 A.D. instead of what is usually stated to be from 1017 to 1137-38. Even if the date and year of his birth could not have been stated with certainty, there could be no doubt that the year of his death would have been noted by the Sri Vaishnavas of those days correctly. The date so recorded seems to be given by a chronogram recording and Dr. Swami Kannu Pillai has it as the year 1137-38. Sri Ramanuja was not born in obscurity. He was the son of a wellknown person Kesava Somayaji, and the nephew and great grandson of the then leaders of the Vaishnavite community. Even if the exact year of birth was not well remembered, it is inevitable that the month and the nakshathra (Chittirai Arudra) would have been remembered. These are invariably required in connection with the Aksharabhyasam, Upanayanam and other rituals a brahmin youth has to go through. There is no valid authority for the year of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s death being shifted by about 13 years. Dr. Iyengar missed noting a fragmentary inscription on the east wall inner side, south of the first (inner) gopuram in the Tirumala Temple. This reads in Tamil.</li>
<li>ānasaumiya ஆனஸௌபிய 2. torunal தொரு நாள் 3. Ramanuja n. 4. en emperuma (QUOI)
Translated into English:-</li>
<li>In Saumya.</li>
<li>Ramanuja.</li>
<li>On a certain day. 4. Emperumanar.
It makes clear reference to Ramanuja at a period of his life when he bore the honorific surname Emperumanar&rsquo; (or our great mahan). He had under that honorific name become the supreme leader of all Sri Vaishnavas. There are only two Soumya years in his life time between 1017 and 1137 A.D. These are 1069 and 1129 A.D. By 1069 his age would have been only 52 and he would not have attained that eminence which got him to be recognised as Emperumanar. So the only appropriate year is 1129-30 A.D. The inscription is in the Tirumala Temple and has found its place in a fragmentary state on the east prakaram

wall (south side of the inner gopuram). How it happens to be there as a fragment requires some explanation. It was already shown in Chapter VIII (part 2) that the inner gopuram in Tirumala was constructed after the life time of Sri Ramanuja and about the year 1180 A.D. This inscription made in 1129-30 A. D. could not be therefore expected to be anywhere in the gopuram. The prakaram walls of that gopuram were constructed at a later date and are known as the second prakaram walls. There were however the first prakāram walls of the original temple which temple was called Kōyilalvar&rsquo; (Vol. I, 88, 1244 A.D.). There were four long inscriptions in the walls of the Kōyilalvar. There were also a large number of inscriptions on the first prakaram walls of that temple. When the reorientation of that temple was executed the walls of the prakaram were demolished to make room for the new walls which encases the Koyilalvar. The demolition was done recklessly and the stones bearing ancient inscriptions got mutilated. These mutilated stones were used while building anew the first prakaram walls and now line the inner face of the walls, now known as the Mukkoti pradakshinam. This has been fully dealt with in Chapter VIII, part 3. There were however several stones which were left loose. Some were used for paving the flooring, some in building the second and third prakaram walls and one is found even in the first tier of the main or outer gopuram. The fragment under reference is one such.
The inference therefore is correct that Sri Ramanuja visited Tirupati and Tirumala in 1129-30 (Saumya year). He was then 102 years old. Tradition also asserts that he visited Tirupati at that age.
We may therefore well assume that the shrine of Sri Govindaraja was built some time before 1129-30 and that the Idol was installed in the year 1129-30 A.D. There is no need to shift Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s birth and death dates. The Tirumala inscription referred to gives a clear indication. That the consecration (rather reconsecration) of Sri Govindarajaswami took place in 1130 is confirmed by a verse in the mantrapushpam portion of the daily puja which reads &ldquo;Phalgunē māsi purnāyām uttararkshēndu
249
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Väsare Govindarajo bhagavan präduräsin mahāmune.&rdquo; Govindaraja Bhagavan is said to have manifested himself on a day when Phalguna Paurnami, Uttaranakshatram and Monday were current. Knowing as we do that it was Sri Ramanuja who consecrated the Idol in Tirupati, it must have taken place in some Saumya year (as stated above) during his life time. The only Saumya year in which Palguna month, Paurnami thithi and. Uttara nakshatram coincided with a Monday is the 24th February 1130 A.D. In Saumya 1070 A.D. the day Palguna Paurnima Uttara was a Saturday and not Monday. There are in all 10 days between the years 1052 and 1147 in which the month, thithi and nakshatra and the week and day are the same as above. But only one of these is in Saumya year.
We may therefore with confidence state that Sri Govindarajaswami was installed in the Tirupati temple on the 24th February 1130 A.D., if the tradition that Sri Ramanuja was responsible for the installation is accepted. Phalguna Pournimi has since then been observed as a day of Pulangi festival (flower decoration) for Sri Govindaraja.
We have to remember that the Temple with its inner gopuram and prakaram walls appears to have been built for Sri Parthasarathyswami only. The dimensions of the prakaram walls are length 263 feet east to west and width, 186 feet north to south; and the main gateway (gopuram) is more or less in the centre of the latter and right opposite to the doorway of Sri Parthasarathyswami temple. Whether these were built after the installation of Sri Govindaraja along side of Sri Parthasarathy, or before that event, is a question which we have no means of deciding. An inscription (1. 85) on the door jambwall, rightside front face of the inner gopuram shows clearly that the gopuram was in existenc before 1219A.D. At the time of the installation of Sri Govind rajaswami in 1130 A.D. the temple of Sri Parthasarathy be&hellip; the older one would have been the more important one. And it would have continued to be so for some time longer until, for some reason or other, its doors were closed for worship Its dhvajastambham and balipitham were removed. Now th

no worship in that shrine as the Murti there is said to have suffered some sort of mutilation or defect. It is perhaps the Garudalvar of that shrine who is now found accommodated separately adjoining the prakaram. In this connection it is worth remembering that the inner and the outer gopurams of the Tirumala temple were built between the years 1180 and 1217 A.D. That seems to have been a period when the Yadavaraya rulers did this kind of service to the temple. It is not unlikely that the gopuram in Tirupati is of the same period.
Then there is the problem of finding out the probable date of construction of the outer gopuram and the extensions of the prakaram walls to the limits of the outer gopuram. We know from an inscription (I. 89) on Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine that the shrine was in existence outside the limits of the inner gopuram in 1220 A.D. But as the inscription is only on the south and west base of the shrine, it would not go to prove the date of construction of the prakaram wall. In 1220 A.D. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine had a private endowment, and did not form a part of the Govindaraja temple.
The earliest inscription (I. 223) we have outside the inner gopuram which can in some manner be taken to give a clue to the probable date of construction of the outer gopuram and its prakaram walls is the one on the north wall (outer side) of the verandah in front of Salai Nachchiyar temple which is dated as 21-2-1457. This shrine has the south prakaram wall (connecting the inner and the outer gopuram) as its back wall and therefore shows that the outer gopuram was in existence long before 1457 A.D. The other inscription on the walls of the adjacent shrines are of later date. An inscription on the west, north and south walls of the second storey of the outer gopuram (Padikavali gopuram) is dated 8-1-1496. There are a few others of much later date.

We thus see that the construction of the temple structures was a matter of slow and continued progress&hellip; Between 1130 A.D. (Govindarajaswami&rsquo;s installati and 1219 A.D. (construction of the inner gopuram) th period of about 89 years. Between 1220 A.D. (Ramanuja&rsquo;s temple inscription) and 1457 A.D., there
251
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
is an interval of 23 years. There were of course some endowments during the latter interval for daily food offerings, festival celebrations etc. We are also aware that from about 1330 onwards till the Vijayanagar empire stood on a firm basis and Săluva Narasimha took an abiding interest in these temples, the best that could be expected was adequate provision for the daily pujas to be performed. Besides the gopuram and prakaram walls, we have a few more structures intimately connected with and which are essential components of Sri Govindaraja Temple. These are the Dvarapalas on either side of the entrance into the shrine in the Chitra-kūta Mantapam, the shrine of Garudalvär, the Dhvajastambham and Balipitham, the shrine of Hanuman and one or two mantapams specially constructed for the use of Sri Govindaraja. These do not appear to have existed in their present form from the beginning.
DVARAPALAS, 1549 A.D.
We may be under the impression that these two divine gatekeepers were installed simultaneously with the installation of Sri Govindaraja. But it is not so. They were installed on 18th March 1549 A.D. (Kilaka year. Saka 1470, Mina month, Bahula Panchami, Monday) by one Nandyala Narapparaya who endowed the two villages of Pallipattu in Nagari Simai and Gundipündi in Anjur division for offering daily 4 Vellai Tiruppōnakam food to the installed deities.
Dhvajastambham (Old).
This was constructed by one Raja Sri Ramaji Madarsu Pantulu of Siddaluru. The year is not given. Anyhow we have now quite a new gold gilt one.
The Big Gopuram about, 1628 A.D.
This gopuram in the Sannidhi Street was constructed by Matla Kumara Anantaraya of the Deva Chola family and is one of his numerous and costly acts of charity.
252
TIRUPATI AND SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
Hanuman Shrine, 1509 A.D.
This was constructed by one Karavattippuli Alvar Appa Pillai in 1509 (Saka 1431). He arranged for daily food offerings also. This temple is at the end of the Sri Govindarajaswami Sannidhi Street and in the Car Street, facing the temple.
Vasanta Mantapam, 1494 A.D.
This mantapam which is in front of the outer gopuram was commenced by Van Sathagōpa Jiyar of the Ahobila Mutt, some time before 1494. One Nallar Angandai took the unfinished mantapam by paying 2000 panam to the Devasthanam as compensation and completed it at his own cost. He made an endowment for the celebration of a Vasanta festival therein.
Mantapam in front of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s Temple, 1494 A.D.
This is perhaps the four-pillar mantapam near Sri Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s temple. It was constructed by Sriman Mahamandaleswara etc. Narasaraja Uḍaiyar, son of Kommaraja Siru Timmaraja Udaiyar who endowed for food offerings therein on several occasions noted in the inscription.
Nirali Mantapam, 1506 A.D.
One Appa Pillai, son of Karavatţippuliyalwar one of Krishnadeva Raya&rsquo;s generals, constructed a mantapam within the first prakaram and near the kitchen. Water used to be poured round it so as to make it look like a mantapam situated in the midst of a tank. He called it the Nirali Mantapam, and made endowments for accommodating the Utsavar therein during the 12 days of the Vaikasi festival and likewise during the Ani festival and for food offerings on such occasions. This arrangement was made as, at that period, there was no pushkarini or tank for the temple and therefore no Nirali Mantapam. This mantapam is still there, but not used for the purpose intended. As a Nīrāļi
253
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Mantapam it was being used till 1512 and perhaps also till 1522 A.D.
Govinda Pushkarini (Krishnarayan Koneri) 1522 A.D.
This pushkarini came into notice for the first time in an inscription 1522 A.D. One Govindaraja, son of Rachiraja (one of Krishnadevaraya&rsquo;s officers and brother of the famous Sāluva Timmarasu) built a small shrine for Sri Gopala Krishnaswami on the bank of Govinda Pushkarini and endowed for daily food offerings. The pushkarini is again mentioned in 1530 A.D. and on its banks a mantapam was constructed by one of the temple accountants, Villiyår, for the special use of Sri Andal during her Nīrāṭṭa Utsavam in Margali month. It fell into disrepair and was renovated in recent times when the Devasthanam was under the management of the last Mahant. Both the names, Govinda Pushkarini and Krishnarayan Koneri refer to this tank.
Chitrakuta Mantapam, 1493.
This is the mantapam in front of the shrine wherein we find the Dvarapalas, and it extends up to where Garudalvar&rsquo;s shrine is located. It is in two parts, the one near the main shrine having the floor higher in level than the eastern half near the Garudalvar shrine. It may be that the two were constructed at different times, although now they form one structure. Whether the two together were called Chitra Kuta Mantapam in 1493 or whether the one near the main shrine had that name we cannot be sure of
Lakshmidevi Mantapam, 1542 A.D.
A Lakshmidevi Mantapam is distinctly mentioned in 1542 in an endowment by one Gangu Reddi in connection with food offerings to Sri Govindaraja and the Nachchimar after Tirumanjanam on the Kartikai festival day. There was a Lakshmidevi festival for Sri Govindaraja instituted by one Nami Setti in 1537. The festival contemplated food offerings etc., in the temple and
254
TIRUPATI AND SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
in a mantapam outside the gopuram. We have therefore to conclude that this mantapam was constructed later than 1537. It perhaps is an extension of the old Vasantamantapam already referred to.
The above are the principal structures which may be considered as integral part of the temple of Sri Govindarajaswami.
Financial Status of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s Temple, (1130 A.D.-1467 A.D.)
What the financial position of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple was after the installation of the Deity in 1130 and right up to the year 1234 A.D. we are not in a position to state. In the year 1219, the Queen of Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya presented 32 cows and one bull for maintaining one Nandavilakku daily. From inscription No. I. 40. which mainly refers to the endowment of land in Kottakalvay of Tirukkuḍavurnaḍu for the amudupaḍi and sattupaḍi of Tirumangai Alvar, we incidentally gather that Sri Govindarajaswami&rsquo;s temple had its own resources in the shape of land probably in the same Kuḍavūrnaḍu, that the produce from Kottakalvay was amalgamated with the income of Sri Govindaraja and that the two were managed by the Sthanattar of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan temple. There was therefore income for the daily puja of the temple. In the same year 1234, Sri Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya endowed in favour of Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple half the village of Payinḍapalle in Kudavur nāḍu, the other half being already the property of Tiruvengadam Temple. We thus see that the corpus of Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple was a separate item. The Payindapalle village was earmarked for the expenses of the Ani Festival for Govindaraja, first started by Vira Narasinga; also for making a Kūtam for the four-faced car; and what was left was for improvements to the temple itself. Unless there was ample provision for the daily puja, this arrangement would not have been made for a festival. We also learn from I. No. 90 dated 1255 A.D., that Periyamāmbaṭṭu was a Tiruvidaiyattam village of Sri Govindaraja. But who endowed this property we are not told. We further learn from I. No. 98 dated 1308 A.D., that certain brahmins of Nerka village
255
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
made arrangements for giving rice and other provisions for feeding pilgrims on Kaisika and Margali Dvadasis, on Makara Sankramanam and Chittirai Vishu. The next endowment that we meet with is in 1390 wherein Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar couples food offering for Govindapperumal during 10 days of his Adhyayanotsavam, with the singing of Tiruppavai in Tirumala during Margali month (There was yet no Adhyayanotsavam in Tirumala). In 1387 Kollikkāvalidasar made an endowment for a daily offering of one Tirupponakam. Fifty years later in 1442 one Karuṇākaradasar made an endowment for offering one Tirupponakam (food offering) daily to Sri Govindaraja. This is the second private endowment for the Deity since the installation in 1130 A.D.
We will therefore be justified in stating that the temple of Sri Govindaraja was an unimportant one till the middle of the fifteenth century A.D. Neither the Chola nor the Pandyan Kings considered it as of any importance. Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya was the only ruler who paid some attention to it. We know that the Yadavarayas disappeared after 1360 A.D., with the death of Sri Ranganatha Yadavaraya. None of the Vijayanagar Kings nor any of their generals seems to have paid even a visit to this temple. It was only after Säluva Narasimha the Viceroy established himself firmly in Chandragiri with a dominating voice in the affairs of the kingdom that the Tirupati temple received any attention. Karunakara Dasar&rsquo;s endowment for one Tirupponakam daily made in 1442 was thus the second recognition. There were endowments for festival offerings made in 1445 and 1446 by the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur who had become one of the Stanattars of Tirumala Temple. Emperumanar Jiyar&rsquo;s endowment for one Tirupponakam daily was made on 21-2-1457. Likewise Chenna Kesava Dasar made an endowment for one Tirupponakam in 1450-51. Kollikkavalidasar&rsquo;s endowemnt for one Tirupponakam was on 24-2-1387 long before even Karunakara dasar&rsquo;s. On 25-8-1454 one Rigvedi Hariappar of Chandragiri endowed for one Tirupponakam and also for feeding 12 brahmins daily. On 7-3-1464 Sottai Tirumala Nambi Tolappar Ayyangar made an endowment of 7000 panams (the largest one up to that
256
TIRUPATI AND SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
date) for offering every night one appapadi. There was no provision for night offering till then (rappadi). Saluva Narasinga Deva Maharaya endowed the villages of Muppaduvēța, Mangoduvelada and Manavuru for offering daily 26 harivana, one appa harivana and one Tirukkanamadai. He also issued an edict permitting the Sthanattar of the temple to distribute amongst themselves the prasadams offered, following the practice in Tirumala.
We thus see that Saluva Narasinga Deva put the coping stone over the structure which was being slowly built by the efforts of private individuals from 1387 to 1467 A.D. We will see later how one Kandaḍai Ramanuja Ayyangar who came in as a desantari or stranger became his chief lieutenant in all temple affairs. We have already gone a little too far ahead of the history of the Tirumala temple itself. But it is necessary as Tirupati was intended to be the subsidiary temple to afford convenience to pilgrims before they commenced the ascent of the Hill.
The Govindaraja temple received considerable impetus from Saluva Narasimha till his death in about 1494 A.D. During the reign of the Vijayanagar Kings, particularly Krishnadevaraya Maharaya and Achyutaraya Maharaya,there was no royal patronage. But some of the officers under them did much. During Sadasivadeva Maharaya&rsquo;s reign there were unprecedented endowments for Sri Govindaraja from private individuals of all classes and grades. As almost all these endowments are mixed up with the endowments for Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan also, they will be considered together later. The period after 1467 A.D. was a prosperous one for Sri Govindaraja and continued to be so even after the downfall of the Vijayanagar Empire.
Note: The absence of Dhvajastambham till about the 16th century was due to the temple being an Adhama Madhyama one which accroding to the Agamas could get on with temporary bamboo pole flag staff installed for each &lsquo;festival occasion. Hanuman Shrine is foreign to the Vaikhanasa Agama. The Dvarapalas are a misfit, the proper ones should be Ganesa and Nagaraja.

CHAPTER XI.
SHRINES ATTACHED TO SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S
TEMPLE AND OTHER TEMPLES.
THERE
HERE are some shrines inside the enclosure formed by the Inner Gopuram and its prākāra walls. From an inscription which is on the door-jamb wall of the inner Gopuram and which relates to the 15th year of the reign of Vira Narasingadevar Yadavarayar, we infer that this Gopuram was in existence before 1219 A.D. This Vira Narasingadeva probably constructed the Padikavali or outer Gopuram in Tirumala also about the same year (1217 A.D.). The unconfirmed tradition, however, is that the Govindaraja Temple and the Gopuram were constructed during the life time of Sri Ramanuja (i.e., about 1130 A.D.).
Within the enclosure formed by this Gopuram and the prakaram walls there were originally only two shrines, one dedicated to Sri Parthasarathy and the other to Sri Govindaraja. The shirnes to saints which are now there seem to have sprung up much later. For we learn that an image of Tirumangai Alvar was an addition to the pantheon made in 1234 A.D. and special provision was made for the daily offerings on account of that āļvār. The inscription does not however state that a shrine was built inside the temple. It may be that an idol alone was installed.
Andal Shrine:-Very near to the shrine of the principal Deity is the shrine dedicated to Sri Andal. The shrine is only a part of the front mantapam screened off by walls. An inscription1 referable to 1308 A.D., which is on the north wall inner side of the shrine makes it certain that Her shrine was constructed before 1308 A.D. From I. 61; (1254 A.D.) we learn that Tirumoļi was recited regularly on all the days of the Vaikasi Brahmotsavam for Sri Govindaraja and food offerings were made and distributed to the public in that connection. This word Tirumoļi may be
258
SHRINES ATTACHED TO SRI GOVINDARAJA S TEMPLE
taken to refer to Nachiyar (Anḍāl) Tirumoļi, or the periya Tirumoļi of Tirumangai Alvar or to Nammālvär Tirumoli, or to all the three. But it is only in or about the year 1495 A.D. (because the donor Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyen is described as Manager of Por-Bhandaram which he became only on 1-1-1495) that we find that Friday Tirumanjanam was provided for her throughout the year and also special food offerings after procession with Sri Govindaraja and Nachchimär on the Tiruvaḍipuram day. Anḍāl was also taken to the foot of the hills to receive the appappadi sent from Tirumala in connection with the birth day celebrations of Kandaḍai Ramanuja Ayyengar. Thus it is only from 1495 A.D., that Andal emerges into full notice.
Nammalvar Shrine 1287 A.D.
We thus see that Sri Anḍal and Tirumangai Alvar have both been installed within the Temple, whereas, Nammalvar&rsquo;s shrine was placed on the bank of the Alvar Tirtham waterfall. This might have been because in those days there was no Pushkarini (or sacred tank) attached to the temple and the Alvar Tīrtham was selected for the purpose of bringing water for the daily Tirumanjanam of Sri Govindarajaswami. The waterfall which is now known as the Alvar Tirtham was probably first sanctified by the location of Nammalvar&rsquo;s shrine on its bank. Since then the water from that riace might have been brought everyday for the daily puja of Sri Govindaraja, in the same way that water from the Akäsa Ganga waterfall in Tirumala is brought for the daily puja of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan. Although the Gopuram, Vimānam, Prakaram walls etc., of the Alvar Tirtham Nammalvar Temple were constructed by one Pallavarayar or Väneḍuttakai Alagar, of Tunjalur about 1287 A.D. (the date is inferred from an other inscription in Nandalur, Cuddapah Dt.) the shrine itself should have been older than that of Sri Govindaraja since it is probable that the shrine gave sanctity to the waters of the waterfall. It is also likely that this Nammāļvār shrine acted as a landmark for the pilgrims&rsquo; route from Tiruchchukanur before Tirupati was founded.</li>

Kulasekhara Alvar&rsquo;s Shrine-1469 A.D.
We learn that in 1469 A.D. Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyengar, the disciple of Alagiya Manavala Jiyyar erected a shrine and consecrated therein the image of Kulasekhara Alvar right in the open ground to the north of Tirupati and within Kottür village limits in 1469 A.D.1
(There is a Mula Bēram as well as Utsava Bēram). The preference shown by Ramanuja Iyengar for a Kshatriya Āļvār was probably meant to please his patron Saluva Narasimha who was treated as a Kshatriya. There is reference to a Kulasekhara Āļvār street in an inscription dated 1512 A.D., There was a mantapam in this temple called Kumāra Ramanujaiyyan mantapam.
Periya Alvar Shrine (before 1300 A.D.)
There is an inscription in Tamil Venba metre I. 177.2 on the west wall of the Periya Alwar&rsquo;s shrine at the foot of the Tirumala Hills (Alipiri or 404) from which we may assume that the temple was built during the Chōla or Pandya rule and that its date may be fixed before 1300 A. D., the same as for the Nammā ļvār shrine near Aļvār tīrtham. The ancient practice was for the pilgrim to take his bath in the Alvar Tirtham as a purificatory measure and then take the blessings of Periyalvar at the foot of the Hill before commencing the holy ascent. We could affirm that Periya Alvar&rsquo;s shrine was in existence at the foot of the hill at any rate before 1485 A.D. as an inscription on the wall of the Shrine ascribes</li>

SHRINES ATTACHED TO SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
that date for the construction of the Lakshmi Narasimha&rsquo;s Temple at Alipiri by Saluva Narasimha Deva. Periya Alvar&rsquo;s shrine served as the point where Sri Venkateswara&rsquo;s prasādams in the shape of appapadi, parivattam, sattupadi, etc., were and are received with temple honours at Tirupati on the occasion of the Sättumurai festivals of the Alvars.
There is another Periya Alvar&rsquo;s shrine built by Pedda Mangamma, mother of Tallapakkam Tiruvengalappan on Pedda Chimugu Hill (near Alvar Tirtham). There is a third Periya Alvar Temple located in Sri Lakshminarayanapperumal temple (supposed to refer to the one in the present Govindaraja South Mada Street for which Prativadi Bhayankara Family are the Kartas). These two temples of Sri Lakshminarayana and Periya Alvar would have come into existence early in the 17th Century.
Thirumangai Alvar shrine in Tirupati (1234 A.D.)
Although an inscription of 1234 A.D. (I. 40) mentions arrangements made by the Periya Naṭṭar, in Kottakalvay village for the pūja of Tirumangai Alvar, it is not clear from the inscription whether on that date there was a separate shrine for Tirumangai Alvar and whether it was within Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple itself. We come across other inscriptions to show that a separate shrine existed. An inscription in Tirumala Temple dated 1328 A.D. (1. 99) (east wall outerside, south of the inner Gopuram) shows that Mahapradhani Singayya Dannayaka made provision from out of the income of Singanallur (Pongalür) for one Tirupponakam (4 marakals of rice) daily for Tirumangai Alvar along with a similar provision for Vira Narasingapperumal in Tirupati. The inference is that there was a separate shrine for the Alvar in Tirupati, before 1328 A.D. An inscription dated 1472 A.D., however, makes it clear that the village of Veņņaivasal (on the banks of the Kaveri river) was granted by one Müvarayar of Viramaḍakkippatti for the daily offering of two tirupponakam to Sri Venkatesa and for constructing a Pallikonḍān Tirumantapam and other buildings for Tirumangai Alvar temple in Tirupati and that Emperumanar Jiyar was made the manager (Kartar) thereof. Another inscription
261
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
which is on the north wall of the second prakara of Tirumangai Alvar&rsquo;s shrine on the Alvar Tirtham road, distinctly shows where the temple stood perhaps from its earliest days of 1234 A.D. The shrine was there on the Alvar Tirtham road and was obviously enlarged by stages. It is now in ruins and blocked up. We find that even in 1547 (8th January) that out of 10,000/kulis of land granted by the Mahapradhani of Sadasivadeva Maharaja a large part was for the temples, Tirumangai Alvar and Kulasekhara Alvar temples. There were quite a number of endowments for this Alvar as he was one of the most popular of the Aļvārs.
Madhura Kavi Alvar Shrine (some time a little
before 1543 A.D.)
There is a shrine dedicated to Madhurakavi Alvar opposite the Kūrathāļvar shrine in the outer precincts of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s Temple. We are not in a position to state when it came into existence. The sattumurai festivals of Sri Nammalvar, Periya Alvar, Tirumangai Alvar, Kulasekhara Alvar, and Uḍaiyavar are referred to again and again in our inscriptions. In Nammālvar&rsquo;s shrine in Alvar Tirtham on the 11th day of the Adhyayanōtsavam, the verses called Kanninun-Siruttambu of Madhurakavi were being recited It was done in Nammalvar&rsquo;s shrine only (1514). In another inscription of 1537 A.D. (on 3 base of first gopuram of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple) there is distinct reference to the five sattumurai days of the five Alvārs, viz., Nammalvar, Periya Alvar, Kulasekhara Alvär, Thirumangai Alvar and Uḍaiyavar for each of whom there is a distinct shrine. But Madhurakavi Āļvār is not mentioned.
In an inscription of 1543 (on East wall of entrance gopuram of Sri Ramanuja shrine) there is, however, an implied reference to Madhurakavi&rsquo;s shrine.1</li>

SHRINES ATTACHED TO SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
Here the Alvar Sannidhi&rsquo; could refer to that of Madhurakavi only. The site of the shrine confirms its late origin. In 1553 A.D., Kondaraja&rsquo;s endowment of Nagari village provides 15 Rekai Pon for 3 days celebration of Madhurakavi Alvar&rsquo;s Adhyaya-
notsavam.
Shrines for Alvars not the work of Sri Ramanuja.
From the details given above it would be clear that not one of the shrines built for the Alvars, including the one for Südikkoḍutta Nächchiyār (Sri Anḍāl) was built during the life time of Sri Ramanuja who is reported to have got the temple of Sri Govindaraja built by a Yadavaraya (Ghattideva of Yadava Narayana). During Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s life time neither in Tirumala nor in Tirupati was any Alvar deified inside or outside the temple. The statement that we find on page 80, of the Epigraphical report of T. T. Devasthanam, that &ldquo;He (Sri Ramanuja) is said to have installed the idol of Sri Govindaraja as well as the images of certain Alvārs in Tirupati,&rdquo; is incorrect. The installation of the images of the Alvars in Tirupati was the pious act of his followers. It is likely that the deification commenced with the setting up of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s image in Tirumala. Even there, there is no separate worship for him. Next, or perhaps simultaneously, was his deification in Tirupati outside the inner gopuram limits.
Tirumala Nambi Shrine.
From the topography we have to surmise that a portion of the raised mantapam adjacent to and east of the inner go puram was partitioned off as the shrine of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s uncle Sri Tirumala Nambi. To Sri Ramanuja his uncle&rsquo;s life-long act of self-surrender to carry unfailingly from day to day a pot of water for the Tirumanjanam of Manavāļapperumal and for the puja of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan must have appealed strongly; and who knows that he did not set up an image of his uncle in that mantapam where we find it today.
263
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Shrine of Ramanuja.
We find just by the side of the above and as part of it, the Shrine of Sri Ramanuja, a little more pretentious than that of Tirumala Nambi with an antechamber. The gopuram must obviously have been of a later date, as it jets out of the mantapam line. It must have been built after 1220 A.D., since an inscription of that year is on the west and south base of Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s shrine. When as may be inferred from the inscription the shrine itself was in need of lamp lighting and flowers before 1220 A.D. a gopuram would not have come into existence. It is also likely that the devoted desciples of Sri Ramanuja held in great esteem his trusted Chela Sri Kūrattalvar and a shrine for him, simple as in the case of Tirumala Nambi, was erected by screening off a portion of the pillared mantapam.
The Kurattalvar&rsquo;s shrine-some time before 1433 A.D.
There is no means of knowing even approximately the date of construction of Kūrattālvār&rsquo;s shrine. An inscription found on one of its walls (north wall of front verandah) does not give the year. But from the word Avaṇikkalari or office of registration (f) occuring therein and also on referring to Inscriptions I. 205-D and I. 204-B which relate to the year Saka 1355 (or 1433 A.D.) wherein the same word occurs to connote the registration office, we may safely conclude that the shrine was in existence at least in 1433 A.D., and that it was constructed probably about the beginning of the 15th century A.D.
The shrines of all the Alvārs are, it must be noted, outside the inner gopuram of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple. Sri Tirumala Nambi and Sri Ramanuja take their place just outside the inner (or first) gopuram. The installation of the Alvars was a slow and gradual process. The first temple for Periya Alvar is at the foot of the hill guarding the ascent. The other temples to him in other places were built later, the latest being in Sri Lakshmi Narayana&rsquo;s temple in south Mada Street Tirupati. Kulasekhara had his temple in the street which bore his name. None of these
264
SHRINES ATTACHED TO SRI GOVINDARAJA&rsquo;S TEMPLE
temples depended on the temple of Tiruvengadamuḍayān or Govindaraja for its maintenance. Each had its own Dharmakarta and each had endowments for its subsistence. But all were affiliated to the main temple of Tiruvengadam. In fact, the practice grew up of having this affiliation sanctified by a procedure adopted for celebrating the Adhyayanōtsavam Sattumurai of each of these Alvārs. It has been well described in an inscription on the south base inner side of the first gopuram of Sri Govindaraja, in an endowment by one Paradesi Tiruvenkaṭayyan.1
The practice, now a long established one is for the morning Tiruvaradhanam of Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan, in Tirumala to be finished early in the morning on the Alvār&rsquo;s Sattumurai day and then the offered appapadi, parivattam, chandanam, betel leaves and nuts transmitted down to the foot of the hill to near Periyāļvār&rsquo;s shrine where the concerned Alvar will arrive in procession to receive the prasadams with due honours. They will be conveyed in procession on elephant back through the main streets of Tirupati and then to the Alvar&rsquo;s shrine. The Alvar has his Tirumanjanam and Sree Govindaraja graces the occasion with his Nachchimars. In the evening there will be a grand procession, the Alvar facing Govindaraja, and being carried backwards as Sri Govindaraja advances forward majestically in great pomp with all paraphernalia, torch light mattappu, burusu, adirvedi and other fire works. There will then be distribution of prasadams in Asthānam. All this pomp was a growth of the 15th century only. It may also be stated here that after the Tirumala, Tirupati temples passed into the hands of the East India Company all the shrines for Alvārs were made dependant on the Govindaraja temple.

Vira Narasinga Perumal Temple-1328 A.D..
Besides the shrines for Alvars there were other shrines or temples constructed from time to time in Tirupati. There was one for Vira Narasingapperumal which came to notice in 1328 A.D. In that year one Mahapradhani Singaiya Dannāyaka made provision in an endowment for daily offering. This temple might have been built by Vira Narasinga Yadava Raya himself or by Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya who made over Pongalur (Singanallur) village to the Dannayaka for instituting certain charities. Prasadams used to be transferred from Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple and distributed here for pilgrims (just as in a Ramanujakutam) in the 15th and 16th centuries. The temple became defunct long time ago. The Narasimha Tirtham in Tirupati marks the spot. This Deity is also referred to in an inscription showing Chennakesa Dasar&rsquo;s food offering of one Tirupponakam each night (I. 224; 1450 A.D.). It was also known as Melai Singar Koyil, because it is in the western part of Tirupati (III. 118, 1517 A.D.).
Salai Nachchiyar Temple-1457 A.D.
The word Salai (8) denotes the temple stores. This Goddess&rsquo;s temple is just opposite to the stores. The real name of the Goddess is Punḍarīkavallittāyār. The date of construction has to be guessed from the fact that on the north wall of the verandah of the temple (outer side) is an inscription dated 2-2-1457, which is the earliest one on its walls. It must have been therefore constructed sometime before 1457. The Vaikhanasa Archakas are its dharmakartas. It is now a part and parcel of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple. The next inscription which is on the east wall (outside) in the front verandah is nineteen years later in date. The third was on 9-5-1476.

Sri Narasimhaswami Temple at Alipiri, 1485 A.D.
The consecration of this temple is inscribed on the east wall of Periya Alvar&rsquo;s Temple at Alipiri and dated 20-4-1485. It was constructed by Sriman Sarvabhauma Narasimha (the famous Saluva Narasimha) the son of Sri Vira Gunḍākshitipati at the foot of the pathway over the Seshadri Hill. It is presumed that it was built to commemorate Saluva Narasimha&rsquo;s becoming the de facto emperor of Vijayanagar. It is now one of the languishing temples in Tirupati. In an inscription of 1544 A.D. it is described as திருமலை வழி காட்டி சிங்கர் கோயில். There is another Narasinga Perumal installed in Kathāri Hanuman temple by Tallapakkam Tirumalai Iyengar.
PERIYA RAGHUNATHA&rsquo;S (SRI RAMA&rsquo;S) TEMPLE IN TIRUPATI-1480-81.
The inscriptions II. 73 and 74 which record the building of this temple and the consecration of Sri Raghunatha are found on the north wall of the front mantapam of Kūrattālvar&rsquo;s temple. The deity came to be known as Periya Raghunatha owing to another Raghunatha having been subsequently installed in 1488 in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s temple (inside Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple) by one Tiruninra-ür-Uḍaiyar Vignesvara Sriman (No. 88 Vol. II. 1488). The name of the donor of the former is Narasimharaya Mudaliar and it was built for the spiritual benefit of Saluva Narasimharaya Udaiyar1.
Some lands were endowed by Narasimharaya Mudaliar of Tirupati which accounted for a daily ration of 6 marakkals of rice, ghee 3 ulakkus, green gram 3 ulakkus, pepper 2 Soliga,</li>

2 marakkals, Ghee 1 ulakku, 1 nali of salt pepper, vegetables, curds, 10 palam jaggery, 10 arecanuts, 20 betel leaves etc.; also provision for celebration of Tirukārtikai festival 6 marakkal rice etc. Thus it started as an entirely private temple quite independent of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple. Inscription No. 74 of 1481 A.D. mentions that one Narasimharaya Mudaliar, living in Kumāra Ramanujapuram, Tirupati, was alone entitled to receive the prasadams. It was therefore independent of the control of the Sthanattar of Sri Govindaraja Temple. It is however, seen that in 1497 the Sthanattar accepted an endowment of 12000 panam made by one Ekāki Perumaldasar (who installed an image of Sri Ramanuja in Periya Raghunatha&rsquo;s temple on that date) for certain offerings to Periya Raghunatha first and then to Sri Ramanuja, II. 137 dated 3-6-1497. Thus the temple within 17 years of its consecration came under the management of the Sthanattars of the Tirumala temple. Even prior to this a connection was forged between Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple and this one by a new festival instituted by one Aniarangadasar Anḍapperumal Sokkannan,1 when Sri Govindaraja during the Vidayatri (up) day of his Ani and Vaikasi festival proceeded to Periya Raghunatha&rsquo;s temple and had his Tirumanjanam or bath there along with His Nachchimar (w). This Mangalāsāsanam (L) in Sri Vaishnava parlance, elevated the status of the Raghunatha temple where the Tirumanjanam took place. The festival was duly recognised by the Sthanattar as shown by the inscription.

In an endowment III. 118, 27-11-1517 A.D. by Dharmapuram Sittamu Setti (merchant of Narasingapuram, Tirupati) we find that food offerings were arranged for Periya Raghunatha along with those for Sri Venkatesa and Sri Govindaraja and others. There is also an endowment by Kōyilkēlvi Vada Tiruvenkaḍa Jiyer for Sri Venkatesa, Venkatatturaivar and Periya Raghunathan for food offerings, another by Mandalam Ayyangar of Präntur. A wooden car for the car festival of Periya Raghunatha was constructed by Kumara Ramanuja Ayyangar (IV. 1,1530 A.D.) for the spiritual benefit of Sri Vira Achyutharaya</p>

Maharaja. Thus within 50 years of its existence this temple became famous; had its own festivals and got attached to the main temple of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan. There was Adhyayanotsavam for Sri Raghunatha instituted by one Uddanḍarayar Ulagappan with food offerings on the tuvakkam (commencement), 6th day and Sattumurai day. Pachchai Lingusetti endowed for one tiruvolakkam food offering on 7th festival day. There was tiruppalli-Oḍatirunal for one day mentioned in Rama Bhattar&rsquo;s endowment of 1532 A.D. An endowment by Tallapakkam Siru Tirumala Ayyangar was made in 1547. There was also a hunting festival for one day instituted in 1547. Kodai festival was started by Yatiraja Jiyar in 1540. The Brahmotsavam of Sri Periya Raghunatha and the car festival are referred to in an endowment by Venkatatturaivar son of Malaininra Bhattar dated 26-11-1545.
Another Sri Raghunatha.
There is another Sri Raghunatha said to have been installed by Ramabhattarayan in 1535 in Tiruvenkatapuram in western part of Tirupati.
It will be seen that the endowments for the temple were after all neither numerous nor plentiful. There were no benefactions by the king or by his ministers, generals and other dependents.
Yet another Sri Raghunatha is said to have been installed by Narayana Dasari Nayakkar on the banks of the Govinda pushkarini in 1606 A.D.
The one temple of Sri Raghunatha (Periya Raghunatha) which is in a flourishing condition to this day is the one now known as Sri Rama&rsquo;s temple with its gopuram, large prakaram, a wooden car, car mantapam etc., and which was built in 1480-81 by Narasimbaraya Mudaliar. At the commencement it was purely a private benefaction having no claim on the Tirumala Devasthanam. Within 17 years of its existence it came under the purview and protection of that Devasthanam. But it continued to retain its independent status in that although it has been working according to the Vaikhanasa Agama, its archakas are different and therefore

also its Sthanikas. It is only on a few occasions that the Acharya Purushas and the Jiyyangars receive honours there. The temple during the management by the East India Company became a component part of the main Devasthanam.
Hanuman Shrine, Tirupati-1491?
The shrine to the east of the big gopuram of Sri Govindaraja situated in the car street may not be as old as the temple of Govindaraja. The Agamas do not mention that a shrine for Hanuman is a necessary adjunct to a Vishnu temple. The first mention of the shrine is found only in an inscription of the year 1491 when one Appaiyan (one of the Sabhaiyar of Tiruchchukanur) made provision for offering one atirasappadi to Sri Govindaraja when he was taken to the Hanuman shrine on Thai Amavasya day (II. 96). For the Saturday Tirumanjanam of Anjaneya, provision was made in the inscription along with endowments for Alvars, etc. Ramanujayyan, son of Narasimharayar Sathagopadasar made provision for food offerings on Saturdays about the year 1500 A.D. (II. 146). In what year a temple was constructed, on the scale we have it now, may be surmised from an inscription III. 17, dated (Saka 1431-1509 A.D.) (on the verandah of the P.W.D. store, G.T.) wherein it is stated that one Kara-Vaṭṭippuliyālvār constructed the temple and consecrated the image of Hanuman (presumably the one attached to Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple). This Hanuman is probably not the one given some offerings shown in No. 179 Vol. III 6-11-1528. The latter might refer to the Hanuman temple on the way to Aļvār Tirtham. Saturday Tirumanjanam and food offerings were provided for by Kuppaiyan (temple accountant), about 1540 A.D. Sri Govindaraja was offered a paruppaviyal prasadam when he visited Hanuman&rsquo;s shrine in Chittirai month.
There is also reference to the installation of Sri Vittalesvara swami in the temple of Hanuman (V. 66, 1546 A.D.) (opposite to Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple). This installation and all the benefac-</li>

tions for the worship of Vittalesvara were made by Udayagiri Devaraja Bhaṭṭar (private secretary of Potlapăți ChinnaTimmaraja, Maharaja of the Araviḍu family). Govindaraja sannidhi Hanuman is also referred to No. 128-Vol. V. no date. One Noytamma Narasaiyan is stated to have consecrated a Hanuman in the temple built by him on the banks of Govinda pushkarini. We have no trace of this. There are some more Hanumans mentioned incidentally in some of the inscriptions whose identity cannot be traced. But almost all of these have disappeared expcet the ones attached to Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s and Sri Periya Raghunath&rsquo;s temple and the Kattari Hanuman on the way to the Alvar Tīrtham.
Govinda Krishnan Shrine-1543 A.D.
We learn that in 1543 one of the temple accountants by name Tiruvanantāļvār Kuppaiyan purchased a piece of land in the Bhashyakar Agraharam (Ayyangar Tiruvithi), Tirupati from a Tiruppaṇipillai, constructed a temple thereon, installed Govinda Krishnan and by an endowment of 1500 panam to Sri Govindaraja, made provision for food offerings being sent from that temple daily to this Govinda Krishnan (V. 6). A second endowment of 2210 panam was also made by the donor in 1545 (V. 58). The temple is not in existence now.
Tiruvenkata Gopala Krishnan Temple-1546 A.D.
A few years later, V. 82 25-10-1546, we find that another accountant Peria Solaiyya constructed a temple for TiruvenkataGopalakrishnan in a mantapam at the eastern end of the same Bhashyakar Tiruvithi and made an endowment of 2575 panams for daily food offerings to be sent every night from Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple. Provision for lighting and for Tirumanjanam on all the 13 Rohini Nakshatras of the year and Visesha divasams were made, jointly by all the fourteen temple accountants.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Gopala Krishna&rsquo;s Temples 1522 and 1537.
There was a Gopala Krishna installed in 1537 by Bhutanatha Rama Bhattar in his tõppu (grove) in Tirupati Vädirājapuram.1 The translator of the inscription construes Vädirajapuram to be Tiruchchukanur. But there is no authority for this. Răchiraja Govindaraja, brother of Saluva Timmarasu constructed a Gopalakrishnan Temple on the bank of Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s Govinda Pushkarini and an offering of four tirupponakam daily was arranged by him for the God (III.154-1522 A.D.). Neither of these exists today. Perhaps the Krishna Vigraham in the temple of Manavālamāmuni is one of these.
Lakshmi Narayana Perumal.
There are two such temples. One was consecrated by Tallapakkam Periya Tirumala Ayyangar in the Tirthavari mantapam in Alvar Tirtham in Tirupati, V. 68, 20-6-1546&rsquo;A:D., after making due provision for lighting and vellai tirupponakam food offering to be made daily and also on all Tirthavari Days of the Brahmotsavams for Sri Govindaraja and also for Achyutaperumal floating festival, sankramanams, etc.
The other temple is the one which is in a dilapidated condition in G. South mada street and mentioned as an endowment by Prativadi Bhayankaram Alagarayyangar Annangaracharya in 1636 A.D. The festivals and endowments connected with this temple are recent ones. There is now a Venugopalaswami in Alvar Tirtham which is nowhere mentioned in the inscriptions.</li>

Achyuta Perumal Temple.
The precise date of construction of the temple and the consecration of Achyutaperumal are not mentioned anywhere. One Nami Settiyar of Krishnarayappaṭṭanam (near Chandragiri) made an endowment of 1230 panams, IV. 92, 1537, saka 1458, for hunting festivals for Govindaraja and Achyutaperumal. There is an endowment for offering Tirupponakam etc., for Achyuta perumal in Tirupati (IV. 108, Vilambi 1538 A.D.). Achyutaraya&rsquo;s inscription on the gopuram of that temple tells us that he paid 400 panam to Sri Venkatesa&rsquo;s Temple to purchase the land for building Achyutapperumal temple and for construction of the agraharam of 100 Brahmin houses round it in Kottur village, etc. We find also that provision for food offerings to this God were made in a number of inscriptions. Achyuta pettai in Tirupati is also mentioned. But it did not flourish for any length of time after the death of Achyutaraya Maharaya. The ruins of the temple and gopuram stand as ancient monuments and the temple is known as Pettai Gudi (a contraction of Achyutapettai Gudi).
Nathamuni Temple-late in 16th Century.
The first mention of Nathamunigal is in No. 241 Vol. IV (neither date nor name of donor available) mentioning (along with the offerings to Sri Venkatesa) one atirasappadi to Nathamunigal of Tirupati in Tirupati. Vol. VI. 12 (18-4-1596) mentions a Nathamunipuram where in front of the house of one Nayanarayyangar Sri Govindaraja was offered a vadaipadi. The next mention is in 1636 in an endowment by Prativadi Bhayankaram Annangaracha.iar which provides that on every Sri Rama Navami day two dosai padi prepared in Govindaraja temple had to be taken to Sri Nathamuni Temple and offered to Chakravarti Tirumaganar (Sri Rama) in Nathamuni street. The temple must have come into existence late in the 16th century A.D. and the street also.

village installed on 19-4-1596 the idol of Sri Varadaraja Perumal, Nachchimar and of Tirukkachchinambi. The shrine is known as Tirukkachchinambi Sannidhi. He made endowments of land for the puja etc., of the deity and the Nambi. Along with Sri Ramanuja, Tkrukkachchinambi was one of Alavandar&rsquo;s desciples. The temple is being well maintained.
Varadaraja Perumal.
There is an older Varadaraja Perumal in Tiruchchukanur and the village of Tiruchchukanur itself was known as Varadarajapuram at one time. No. 157 Vol. IV-13-2-1541 refers to food offerings to Varadaraja on the occasion of car festival, tirthavari tiruppali odam and Uriadi; all in front of the donor&rsquo;s house (Chettalur Srinivasayyan). The same inscription makes endowments for Sri Venkatesa, Sri Govindaraja and Alagia Perumal. Whether the Varadaraja and Alagia Perumal refer to the Deities in Tiruchchukanur is not specifically stated. Some of the food offerings to Varadarajaswami mentioned in No. 99 Vol. V 17-8-1547 may be taken to refer to this God although the word Tiruchchukanur is not mentioned explicitly.
Varadaraja Perumal is not mentioned in any of the previous inscription whether in Tirupati or in Tiruchchukanur. There are two other Varadarajas (one in Sri Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s shrine and the other in Sri Manavala Mahamuni&rsquo;s). But both those shrines do not belong to the inscriptional period; they belong to a much later period. There is a Mainji Varadarajaswami in the Govindaraja temple now, but whence He came we do not know. The Varadarajaswami in Tirumala has never had a separate festival.
Nammalvar Temples. (Two in number) Alvar Tirtham Nammalvar.
It was already stated that one Pallavarayar of Tunjalur (Vānedutta Kaialagar) constructed the Temple, vimanam and prakaram

walls of the Nammālvär shrine on the bank of the Alvar Tirtham. This donor lived some time about 1287 A.D., as is inferred from the date of other inscriptions to his credit in Nandalur (pages 69, 79 of Vol. I of T.T.D. inscriptions).1
Another inscription I. 58 in Sanskrit Grantha characters also in the same shrine tells us that a certain Muni lives there1 on the bank of the lake (fon ) and that realising that the present age is ruffled by Kali he, who has attained Divyagñanam initiates us with compassion into Brahma vidya. The Muni&rsquo;s name is not mentioned nor is the name of the lake (tatavarai). But from No. 57 referred to above we infer that the muni referred to is the Alvar (Nammāļvār). From the language of Para 9 of No. 83 Vol. II. 6-6-1485 (Govindaraja temple inscription) which enumerates the endowments made by one Nällar Anganḍai it appears that Periyalvar, Nammāļvār, Tirumangai Aļvār, Kulasekhara Alvar and Udaiyavar on the occasion of their Sattumurai day, during their respective Adhyayanotsavam in Tirupati, received from Tirumala one Appapadi prasadam in the Vasanta mantapam of Sri Govindaraja. The presumption, therefore, would be that on the Sattumurai Day of his Adhyayanotsavam Nammāļvār was taken to this Vasanta mantapam in Sri Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple</p>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
along with Sri Govindaraja for the Sattumurai function where the appapaḍi was offered. This was in 1485 A.D., when Ālvār Tirtham Nammalvår temples was in a flourishing condition.
It is natural to presume that the idol of Sri Nammāļvār was brought in procession to Sri Govindaraja temple. The details of the etiquette of these Sattumurais will be described presently. Again a Tirumala Temple inscription dated 4-12-1494, states (among the endowments relating to temples in Tirupati) that Nammāļvār, Kulasekhara Alvar and Tirumangai Alvar were offered one appapadi each on the day of Sattumurai while seated in the mantapam in Narasimharayapuram built by one Saranu Setti, one of the nagarattar residing there. This offering would have been made in the course of the street procession of Nammalvar along with Sri Govindaraja. There are inscriptions of a like nature on pages 344, 345 of Vol. II whose dates are not given as the inscriptions are incomplete ones. Again one Pappusetti ayyan of Narasingarayapuram made provision, among other items in Tirupati, for three atirasappadi on three days of the Sattumurai of Nammalvar&rsquo;s Adhyayanotsavam. This must also refer to Āļvār Tirtham Nammalvar as the function was held in a mantapam constructed on land near Tirumangai Alvar temple and belonging to it. One Yatiraja Jiyar came forward in 1514 A.D., as the Kartar (manager) of Nammālvār shrine (the inscription is on west wall of Nammālvār shrine near Alvar Tirtham and accepted an endowment of 150 panams by one Pattarpiran Ayyan one of the Sättada Ekaki Sri Vaishnavas for one tiruvõlakkam food offering on the 11th day of Nammalvar&rsquo;s Adhyayanotsavam in the month of Masi. It is clear from the inscription that this temple had its own treasury account. In 1517 we find that one Dharmapuram Sittamu Setti provided one appapadi to be presented in the mantapam in Kulasekhara Alvar temple, Tirupati on the 6th day of Nammalvar&rsquo;s Adhyayanotsavam. There was food offering provided by Sriman Narayana Jiyar of the Van Sathagopan Matham on the 9th day festival. Pattarpiran Ayyan provided in 1523 food offering on 7th and 8th day festivals every year. This Nammāļvār was given landed property in Elamandiyam village, known as Nammālvār Paṭṭadai. The same Pattarpiran Ayyan made another
276

endowment in 1535, of 150 panam for Tirupalli-eluchchi offerings during Margali month. Paradesi Tiruvenkatayyan endowed in 1537, 460 panams for bringing from Tirumala to Tirupati appapaḍı, parivattam etc., for the Tiruvadhyayanatuvakkam function, of the five Alvārs including Udaiyavar and Nammālvär. These endowments clearly indicate that this Nammalvar temple did not depend on the Govindaraja temple for its existence. Provision for food offerings on the 2nd and 6th days of Nammālvār&rsquo;s Adhyayanotsavam in Tirupati was made by one Perarulalayyan, in 1541. One of the items of expenditure shown in Vengapuram Narayana Setti&rsquo;s endowment of 48,900 panams made in 1544 was for cleaning the mantapam in Nammāļvār&rsquo;s temple. This leads us to suspect that the temple was not in daily use to any large extent in the 16th century. There was however a car festival also for this Nammālvär during the Sattumurai day of his adhyayanotsavam, when the car circumambulated his shrine.
Ramanuja Kutam Nammalvar.-the rival temple.
About this time i.e., 1544 A.D., a rival temple of Nammālvār was built in Bhashyakar Agraharam (now G. North Mada Street) Tirupati by one Araviḍu Konḍaraja (son of Mahamandalesvara Araviḍu Ram raja Konētiraja). This Kondaraja made a grant of ten villages yielding an annual income of 5713 rekai-pon for feeding Sri Vaishnava pilgrims in the Ramanujakutam attached to this Nammāļvār shrine. The inscription (V. 125,) dated 2-10-1550 gives full details of the nature and kind of foodnearly 500 marakkals of rice were consumed daily. Again we find that the same donor made in 1552 A.D. (V. 133) grand and elaborate arrangements for the celebration of the Adhyayanotsavam Sattumurai of Uḍayavar and Nammāļvār. Over and above this the same donor made another endowment in 1553 (V. 141) for the celebration of a 12 days festival for Nammālvār costing 126 rēkhai-pon and 6 panam per annum; also for the car festival of Sri Govindaraja in the month of Ani and for the celebration of the Sattumurai of all Āļvārs and Acharyas, in his Ramanujakutam Nammāļvār shrine. For all these purposes, he gifted away Nagari village and Viḍugramam yielding an annual income of 400 rekhaipon.
277
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Rivalry between the two temples.
Where was the necessity for this rival Nammālvār temple we would naturally ask. This Temple eclipsed the older and the better located one. We can only guess the reason. The Kartar of the older temple was the Tengalai Jiyyengar while the manager of the younger one at the time was one Tirumalai Nambi Sriramayyangar, a member of the Vaḍagalai Tirumalai Nambi family. The members of the family of the Aravidu and Matla rajas were the disciples of the Tirumalai Nambi family. The Jiyyangar and the Tirumalai Nambi family were holding high religious status in the temple. If they had been less sectarian all these endowments would have been lavished on the Alvar Tirtham Temple only. The result of this rivalry was that in course of time both the temple lost their importance. Nammālvär is now in the small room in Govindaraja Temple along with the other three Alvārs. But his annual festival continues to be celebrated.
Tirupati and its suburbs.
We have so far noticed almost all the minor temples constructed in the suburbs of Tirupati and in the main temple of Govindaraja also. The suburbs which came to notice are Bhashyakar Agraharam within the four main streets or Raja Vithis of Tirupati; Srinivasapuram containing the temple of Vira Narasingaperumal; Raghunathapuram, containing the temple of Periya Raghunatha; Tiruvenkatapuram which must have been adjacent to Srinivasapuram; there is also one Narasingarayapuram in the west; Achyutarayapuram containing the temple of Achyutaperumal and Nathamuni Agraharam. There is also a Vadirajapuram mentioned in the 16th century with Narasimhaswami temple. It is not possible to demarcate these suburbs at this distance of time. They only serve to give us an idea of how the small settlement of Bhashyakar Agraharam extended its limits from time to time. The Periya éri which came to notice in 1260 A.D. was practically the southern limit and the foot of the hills and älvär Tirtham the northern limit. On the west Siddhakkuttai and Narasingarayapuram may be considered the limits; to the east the village would have

been only what it is now, for there have been spring channels and wet cultivation there.
For a Vishnu temple a pushkarini (or sacred tank) is a necessity. Water for Tirumanjanam (holy bath) and Puja has to be brought daily in procession to the temple. On the 9th or Tirthavari day of the Brahmotsavam the function of Chakrattalvar (Sri Sudarsana) sanctifying the water for a bath has to take place in a pushkarini. We have so far seen that there was only one such place from which water (from the water-fall) could be brought. This is now known as Alvar Tirtham. There it can from time immemorial, long before the temple of Sri Govindaraja was ever thought of.
ALVAR TIRTHAM-TIRUPATI.
The earliest inscription I. 20 found on the bank of this pool of water formed by the water-fall, is on the door jambs of a shrine (now known as Kapilēsvaraswami Temple). The inscription does not give the name of the shrine, nor is there any mention of the water-fall near which the shrine stands. There is no date furnished. It reads in Tamil &ldquo;Svasti Sri Kottur Uḍaiyan rayan rajendra Sōlanāna Pirama mārāyan Munaiyatarayam eḍuppitta tirumaligai. It would be translated as &ldquo;Hail, prosperity; this blessed abode(f) raised (7) by Koṭṭūr Uḍaiyān (or proprietor of Kottur) Rayan Rajendra Cholan () also known as Brahmarayan Munaiyatarayan.&rdquo; If it was meant to be the temple of a God some indication would have been given by the use of a word like Koyil and the name of the deity. We give credit to the fact that the inscription relates to the reign of Rajendra Chola-I or Rajendra Chola-II. The former reigned from 1013-1045 A.D. and the latter 1070-1122 A.D. The second Rajendra Chola assumed the name of Kulottunga-I in later years. We can safely put this inscription to 1070-1075 A.D. The Devastha-</li>

nam epigraphist translates the word. LOT of as &ldquo;Blessed Tabernacle&rdquo; which requires explanation. In the Vaishnavite as well as Saivite, paribhasha or refined language the dwelling house of a great or learned person is invariably called IT CAN %** whereas that person himself in similar paribhasha would call it 4&rdquo; (hut). The word tabernacle seems to have no equivalent in any of the Indian languages. Tabernacle of the Jews was the altar on which burnt offerings were made. The nearest equivalent will be &ldquo;Koyil&rdquo; (or Koyil Alvar accoridng to Sri Vaishnavas). We can understand this somewhat better when we refer to inscription I. No. 57 and 58 in the Nammāļvār temple close by. Both are on the bank of this very (water-fall) pond. Inscription No. 57 is on the inner side of the west wall of the Nammālvār shrine. This temple or shrine was renovated by one Pallavarayar or Vāneduttakaiyalagar, whose date we infer from some Nandalur inscriptions to be about 1287 A.D. and therefore more than two centuries after the former one, which translated would read &ldquo;vimanam mantapam and the maligai, the (entire structure inclusive of prakaram walls, gopuram etc.) are the dharmam (charity) of Pallvarayar or Vaneḍuttakaiyālagar of Turijalur in middle third Milalaikuṛram in the Pandyanādu.&rdquo; The Devasthanam epigraphist here translates măligai as sanctuary&rdquo; (not tabernacle). The word
would comprise the entire structure as we understand the paribhasha common to us. Inscription No. I 58 which is also in the Alvar shrine is in Sanskrit (grantha characters) and states that on the banks of the tank ((for 3) at the foot (of the hill) a Muni lives. The inscription being in Nammāļvār shrine we take it to refer to that Muni or it may by a stretch of imagination be taken to refer to a muni or some great person who lived in the
which Brahmarayan munaiya Daraiyan raised on the bank of the tank about 1070 A. D. as per inscription I. 20.

or a highly venerated man and not to the sanctuary of God. And Munaiyadarayan does not state that he raised the structure for any God. The Tirtham or pond is neither mentioned nor named as Kapila Tirtham; nor is the shrine called Kapileswara&rsquo;s temple. Nor do inscriptions No. 57 and 58, give the Tirtham a name. But we must inevitably admit that the water source for the daily Tirumanjanam and Puja of Sri Govindaraja from the date Sri Ramanuja installed the Mürti must have been this Tirtham, by whatever name it might have been called; for there was no tank then near Govindaraja&rsquo;s temple. In the absence of any name to be found in our inscriptions we will be justified in presuming that it may have been named Alvar Tirtham, whether the word Alvar referred to Nammalvar or the Sudarsana or Chakrattålvar of Sri Vishnu who sanctified the waters.
In No. 29 Vol. II (May-June 1467) reference is made to a festival (assumed to be Upakarmam day) when Sri Govindaraja with Sri Devi and Bhu Devi had Snapana Tirumanjanam in the waters (of the tank) and thus sanctified the waterfall. The inscription is in Govindaraja temple but the reference is made to Āļvār Tirtham waters as the Upakarmam takes place only on the banks of the Alvar Tirtham even to this day. But the inscription does not give the name of the tank. The Govinda Pushkarini was not in existence in 1467. The inscriptions which give us a clear understanding are No. 8, 9 and 10 of Vol. IV dated 25-6-1531, during the reign of Sri Vira Achyutaraya Maharaya. No. 8 is in Telugu, No. 9 in Kanarese and No. 10 in Tamil. (language and script). They are identical in substance, viz., that Acyutaraya for his purushärtham renovated the tank (did Punahpratishtha,1 (in Telugu the words are missing) constructed cut stone steps, Sandhyavandana Mantapam all round and planted (
ZÁS) Sudarsana stones at the four corners (STES శిలాస్థాపనమున్ను), The Telugu inscription describes the tank as శ్రీ తిరువేంగడనాధ దేవునిదివ్య తీర్థమ్ తిరుతి చక్రతీర్థమ్. The Kanarese version is the same. But the Tamil version No. 10 reads திருவேங்கட முடையான் ஷீவூ தீர்த்தமான திருப்பதியில் ஆழ்வார் தீர்த்தத்தை.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
All call it Tiruvengalanatha&rsquo;s sacred waters, alias Tirupati Chakra Tirtham (in Telugu and Kanarese) and Alvar Tirtham in Tamil. As already surmised the word Alvar in Tamil in this inscription may refer to Chakrattālvār or Sudarsana and not Nammålvär. It is thus clear that according to this inscription it was, in days anterior to the inscription, known as Chakrattālvār Tirtham, Chakra Tirtham or Alvar Tirtham. It seems to have had no other name. These names might have been given to the waters after the construction of the Govindaraja Temple. It was however not known as Kapila Tirtham.

Brief reference will now be made to subsequent inscriptions about this Tirtham. No. 49 Vol. IV. 13-7-1535 states1 (Govindaraja bestowing the waters in the Alvar Thirtham on Tirthavāri day). In No.169 Vol. IV dated 20-1-1542 (p. 320 para 20) occurs ‘ஆழ்வார் தீர்த்தத்தில்&rsquo;. In No. 34 Vol. V. 19-3-1544 P. 87 para 88 reads.2

Sottai Tirumalai Nambi Srinivasa Ayyangar, V. 92, June 1547, among his endowments mentions1 a Tiruvengadamudayan image in 4th cave above Alvar Tirtham. Among the several acts of charity of Matla Anantaraja the establishment of a free feeding house in Alvar Tirtham Seshachala Kuruvai is mentioned.2 The first mention of a Kapilesvara shrine (not any tank) is in an inscription dated 30-1-1563, Saka 1485 in Dundubhi year, Kumbha month, Suklasaptami Saturday, Bharani Nakshatra, when a dancing girl Sevvu Sāni donated 200 panams from the interest whercon the daily worship of Sri Vignesvara (one lamp to be lit in the evening and flowers and food offerings with two marakkals of rice) installed in the Nritya mantapa of Nayaniyar Kapilesvara Mudayan Nayanar Kovil was to be carried on. The inscription does not state that the tank was called Kapila Tirtham.
Long time thereafter on 10-2-1865 A.D., (after an interval of 302 years from 1563 and 237 years from 1628 A.D.), we come to an inscription which says that Sri Mahant Dharma Dasu, Vicharanakarta did repairs to the Kapila Tirtham.3
&ldquo;Thus it was on 10-2-1865 that we were told by Dharmadasji that Alvar Tirtham is Kapila Tirtham. But we have seen enough to note that it is a misnomer, and that throughout all the centuries in the past it has been known only as Alvar Tirtham. It is called the Divya Tirtham of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan, but flowing to Tirupati. It has always been considered as flowing from the tee of Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan and therefore holy. There was a Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan installed in the fourth cave of the waterfall above Alvar Tirtham where the waters roll down in cascades.</p>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
SRI KAPILESWARASWAMI TEMPLE
AT
ALVAR TIRTHAM, TIRUPATI.
This temple is situated on the high ground on the east bank of the Alvar Tirtham, also now called Kapila Tirtham and faces west.
There are only two inscriptions which relate to this temple. The earlier one, as was already stated, is on the door jambs of the temple. It does not mention the date, but from the contents can be ascribed to the Chola period, either Rajendra I or Rajendra II in the later half of the eleventh cetnury A.D.1
The inscription translated into English would read &ldquo;Svasti Sri: This Tirumaligai (was) raised by Rayan Rajendrasōlan, alias Brahmanarayan Munaiyadaraiyan.&rdquo; The Devasthanam epigraphist translated the word Tirumaligai as &ldquo;Tabernacle.&rdquo; The Tamil word Tirumaligai would be used when referring to the residence of a great religious teacher, or saint (QuGunta B). There is in fact no Tamil equivalent for the Jewish tabernacle which was a movable place of worship having an altar for burnt sacrifice. In a depolarised sense a tabernacle is a place of worship. But the idea of having a concrete image for worship would not be germane to a tabernacle.
If the structure raised by Munaiyadaraiyan was a temple or sanctum, the proper Tamil word would have been Koyil (69) whether it be one for Siva or for Vishnu. In I. 23 (1094 A.D.) which gives details of an endowment for Sri Parasaresvara&rsquo;s temple in Tiruchchukanur, the word used is Koyil. Also in I. 25 (1111</li>

A.D.) the temple of Sri Kalahastesvara is called koyil.1 In I. 35 (1223 A.D.) we find the temple referred to as koyil. Also in I. 36, 1225 A.D. which refers to an endowment of 1008 A.D. for Sri Parasaresvara&rsquo;s temple the word koyil occurs.&rdquo;
It is therefore improbable that the structure raised by Munaiyadaraiyan during the reign of Rajendra Chola was a temple for a God. It might have been raised to serve as residence for a living saint, or to instal the image of any such saint, say Saint Kapila. Further a temple for God would usually be made to face East and not West. The shrine or temple for Saint Nammālvär, which is close by, faces west because the saint must be made to face Sri Venkatesa as the Hill and not show his back to God. It is even probable that the door jamb on which the inscription is found was originally the door jamb of the shrine of Sri Nammālvār before that temple was rebuilt about 1287 A.D. by Pallavarayar and that the rejected door jamb was used at a later date for the Kapilesvara Temple.
There is another consideration also to justify this interpretation. If it was a temple for Siva it would have received encouragement at the hands of the Saivite Cholas in the same way that the Tiruchchukanur Parasaresvara temple had received during the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This temple of Sri Kapileswara is not me tioned in any inscription till we reach the year 1563 A.D.

We are distinctly told that the Nayanar Kapilesvara mudaiya Nayanar&rsquo;&rsquo; is the presiding Deity of the temple. We do not know why the word Nayanar is used as a prefix as well as a suffix to Kapileswaramuḍaiyan. Nayanar is used as referring to Siva as well as a Saivite saint. Could we interpret the phrase to mean the Nayanar who was worshipped by Kapileswara mudaiya Nayanar but having no special name?
An Emperumânaḍiyar Sevvu Sāni made an endwoment of 200 panam. We are also informed that owing to (heavy) rains the compound wall and the kitchen of the temple collapsed and were repaired by Rachchuvitțu nayakkar, perhaps taking this 200 panam as a loan. The temple had its own Sthanattar and its own accountant according to this inscription. The endowment was for Sri Vighnesvara and not for Sri Kapileswaraswami.
We hear no more about this temple until we reach the period when the East India Company took over the administration of all the temples in Tirupati and Tirumala at the beginning of the 19th century A.D. There were, according to the Tasdik Book for the period from Fasli 1233 to Fasli 1242, (1824 to 1833 A.D.) under the company&rsquo;s management 19 major temples and 17 minor temples in Tirumala and Tirupati. The temple of Sri Kapileswara Swami was classed as a major temple and was in receipt of an annual contribution of Rs. 175-14-0 in cash from the circar. It had no income of any other kind. Its expenditure is also shown as Rs. 175-14-0. It was not dependant on the Tirumala Devasthanam for this contribution, but on the circar. After the temples in Tirumala and Tirupati were handed over to the Mahant as Vicharanakarta in 1843 A.D., the Mahants failed to darw the circar contribution, but paid the same amount of Rs. 175-14-0 from the Tirumala Devasthanam funds. In fact the Mahants</p>

failed to draw the circar contribution in the case of all the temples handed over to them, including the temple of Sri Venkateswara in Tirumala.
The location of the Balipitam and Dhvajastambham of Sri Kapileswara&rsquo;s temple on the roof of the Sandhyavandana Mantapam of the tank indicates that they must have been raised after the building of the Sandhyavandana Mantapam around the Alvar Tirtham in 1531 A.D., by Achyutharaya Maharaya.
It is now one of the four component major temples of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and well serves the needs of the Saivite community in Tirupati.

CHAPTER XII.
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS.
SECTION 1.
Classification of Temples according to their origin.
TEMPLES dedicated to Vishnu in any of His reputed forms or in any form which appealed best to the mind of the donor are consecrated in conformity with the procedure laid down in the Samhita which is proposed to be followed thereafter. The Samhitas are numerous; some expound the tenets of the Vaikhanasa Agama and some the tenets of the Pancharatra. In most cases the main as well as the subsidiary images (called the Dhruva Murti and the Parivara devas) are made by silpis or sculptors who are well versed in the ancient rules for the manufacture of icons. Such images are consecrated in the newly built temple. There are also a large number of temples wherein are Murtis whose origin is not traceable Some are called Puranik because the place is mentioned in one or other of the Satvik puranas and the Murti or Bimbam said to have been set up and worshipped by one of the Puranic Heroes. The Main Image, at any rate is not presumed to have been made by any Silpi of this Kaliyuga. There are also temples where the Main Image is presumed to have been installed and worshipped by a Siddha or Rishi in one of the previous Yugas. In this case also the modern Silpi has had no hand in the carving of the Image. The fourth class comprises temples erected and images installed by the Devas themselves. The images therein were worshipped by the Devas. The fifth class of temples is known as Svayam Vyaktam. Sri Vishnu out of His Infinite love manifested Himself in a few places in the form of a Murti so that His Bhaktas may worship there daily and obtain Salvation (freedom from birth).
288
TEMPITS AND THE AGAMAS
Limitations to Agama rules.
The rules laid down in the Agama Samhitas for the iconography of the different forms of Murtis and the precise form of daily worship apply in every detail to temples first mentioned above, namely, the Manusham class wherein the Bimbam and the temple were made and consecrated by man. In the other cases the daily form of worship (the norm of worship) would as far as possible be in accordance with the procedure given in the Agama Samhită which is adopted for that temple. If any difference is noticed in the features of the Image from what is given in the Silpa Săstram, the presumption is that the Image was made according to Bhagavat Săstram. Therefore no attempt should be made to effect any alterations. Also if there had been old usages and practices which were existing when the Vaikhanasa or Pancharatra form of worship was first introduced those usages and customs should under no circumstances be interfered with. The temple of Jagannath is often cited as an instance and so also the Tirumala temple.
The spiritual aura or influence of a Svayam Vyaktā sthalam will be felt in all the worlds; that of a Daivika Sthalam will extend all round over one hundred Yojanas; that of an arsha Sthalam over a five Yojana radius, that of a Pauranikam over a three Yojana radius and that of a manusha Sthalam over a radius of one Yojana only. (Vide Marichi Samhita 98th patalam pp. 522, 523 and Bhrigu Samhita 34th Chapter pp. 390 to 392; both Telugu editions).
The Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra Agamas.
The Agamas are two in number, the Vaikhanasa and the Pancharatra. Each claims for itself greater antiquity, superiority and sanctity. The points of difference are immaterial so far as the average worshipper is concerned. The points of agreement on fundamentals are so many that our Acharyas have accorded equal recognition to both. The main differences will however be given consideration in this Chapter. It will also be shown how by the removal, or omission of the images of the Vyūha forms in the first avaranam of the temple the differences carry no significance.
19
289HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Agama Samhitas deal with a variety of topics. Some devote more attention to the details of the architecture, including iconography. Some deal with the different types of temples and the images appropriate for each. Some devote more attention to installation ceremonies, nityarchana and festivals. Some about expiatory ceremonies for defilement, failure to perform pūjas in time or mutilation of images and damage to consecrated structures. A few give an account of the metaphysical and mythological conceptions on which are based the theories of the efficacy of temple worship as the safest and surest means to end mortality and to attain to immortality and eternal communion with the Para Brahmam in Heaven. These conceptions are the postulates of Hindu theology. Temple worship has therefore its roots in them.
FUNDAMENTALS OF TEMPLE WORSHIP.
Postulates accepted in Temple Construction and Worship.</li>
<li>The Nishkala Brahmam:-The Nishkala Brahmam is formless and is indescribable by any attributes. But all attributes which are used to describe Him are in Him in a latent condition as ghee is in milk, as oil in sesamum, scent in flower, juice in fruit and fire in wood.</li>
<li>Sakala Brahmam:-This is the next stage in which Brahmam assumes of His own Sankalpam a form with all attributes. Just as fire comes out of wood when rubbed, so also by constant dhyānam or meditation of the Bhaktas and of His own Choice or Sankalpam He assumes forms. As many sparks of fire shoot out from burning wood, so also do Brahma, Isāna and the other Dévatas arise.1
31</li>
<li>Kasthe agnir mathanadujjvalanniva Lishkalatmakō Vishnur dhyanamathanēna bhaktya Saukalpanat sakalo bhavati. Tasmadagner vishphulinga iva Brahmēsanadi Devata rūpair bhinnatvat &hellip; (Marichi, page 488 Telugu edition) This account of the origin of Brahma, Rudra and the other devatas is vague and does not contemplate to fit in with the Puranic account of Brahma emanating from the navel of Narayana. The Vaikhanasas however do subscribe to the Puranic Story.
290
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS</li>
<li>The Saguna Brahmam:-The next postulate is that the Sakala Brahmam is Saguna Brahmam as well. It has not only a body but also innumerable auspicious attributes (Kalyāna gunas) and no inauspicious ones. Matter in its most rarefied, imperceptible and impalpable state, known as Mūla Prakriti is His Body. This Prakriti is inseparable from Him and exists for Him only. It has no independent existence. He pervades it through and through. This Mula Prakriti is said to be of two kinds a lower and a higher one. The lower one known as Prakriti goes through eight stages of transformation or transmutation, viz., Manas, Buddhi, Ahankaram, Ākāsam, Vayu, Tejas, water (fluid) and earth (Solid) (An elucidation of these states is not given here, being not necessary for our purpose) By a multiplicity of combination of these and by their interaction with the higher Prakriti called Jivatma which somehow has got enmeshed therein Mula Prakriti becomes this wonderful universe. On the body of the Saguna Brahmam this Mula Prakriti assumes the shape of mole marks. (called Sree vatsam). Sri Devi is seated on a lotus standing above the Sreevatsam and she is the abhimani devata of Mula Prakriti. The form of Sri Devi is also given in the Samhita and Her relationship to the Saguna Brahmam described. She is called the Vibhuti or everything that constitutes prosperity, wealth, happiness, etc, of Vishnu. She is part and parcel of Him; she assumes forms, sizes, etc., to suit His will. She is the Sakti or Power of Mula Prakriti and is Pushti.1</li>
<li>Srishti Sthiti and Samharam:-Somehow and at some time in the unknown hoary past and aided by the interaction of the three gunas (Satva, Rajas and Tamas) which are also His creation, the Jivatma got enmashed in the lower Prakriti. As a consequence the Jivatma has to enjoy the fruits of its actions in an endless cycle of birth and death with old age, sickness, pain

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
and pleasure. Looking at the Jivatma as only a higher form of Prakriti is the one given in the Gita. In this connection the Rigvedic conception of the relationship between Paramatma, Jivatma and Prakriti also deserves consideration, being older than that of the Gita. It is found in the verses of Sukta 164 and gives a higher status to Jiva.
&ldquo;Two birds of beautiful wings, comrades intimately related to each other, are perching on the same tree; one of the two tastes of the sweet fruit while the other simply looks on without eating anything.&rdquo;
(Verse 20)
&ldquo;Where the fair-winged through powers of knowledge have ever and anon infused a spark of immortality, there in myself a simple creature, the most wise Lord that preserves all the world has taken his abode.&rdquo;
(Verse 21)
&ldquo;The tree whereon the charming bird tasting of its own sweetness takes shelter and whereon all of them deposit their brood, the fruit on the top of that tree is said to be very delicious; none can enjoy it who do not know the Father.&rdquo;
(Verse 22)
By His Sankalpam and as a matter of sport to Him this cycle of births and deaths of all Jivas and Prakriti is punctuated by periods of partial dissolution and creation and also wholesale dissolution and creation, with an interlude when all matter and the jivas are reduced to the primary state of Mula prakriti. The jivas carry with them in this atomic condition the germs or seeds of the fruits of all their actions. This mass of prakriti and jivas lies preserved and protected in the womb or body of Brahman in His form as Narayana. There is really no change but an orderly preservation or Sthiti. They lie in this condition until at His will a next creation takes place. In this creation each jiva makes a fresh start from a place and under conditions which its accumulated past achievements entitle it to. Vishnu&rsquo;s function of giving protection to jivas is thus a continuous one and has no period of rest. Srishti, Sthiti and Samhāram (creation; protection and preservation; and dissolution) take place ever recurringly.
292
TEMPLIS AND THE AGAMAS</li>
<li>While Sthiti is the function which in His form as Vishnu, Sriman Narayana attends to, the work of creation is assigned to Brahma. From out of the navel of Narayana Brahma arises as the first created Jiva endowed with the Divine power to fulfil the task. Sankara or Rudra is created, according to the Vaishnavite or Satvik puranas, by Brahma for accomplishing dissolution. Besides the wholesale dissolution of the universe, partial dissolution and recreation take place from time to time of the three lokas (Bhur, Bhuvar and Suvarlokas). This is mythology which is unquestioningly believed in. There are also other devas,. such as Indra and the other lokapalas, and the Navagrahas, who are Brahma&rsquo;s creation.</li>
<li>The ultimate goal of the Jiva is to free itself from association with Prakriti, thus end the cycle of births and deaths and attain to a state of eternal communion with the Paramätman.</li>
<li>There are four ways of reaching this goal, viz., Japam, Homam, Dhyanam and Archa.
(a) Japam:-Japam is the recital with a concentrated mind of certain words, phrases or sentences which are called mantras and which, if properly pronounced and be associated with ideas, confer on the aspirant great spiritual power and bring about realisation of the object in view. Ashtaksharam, Shaḍaksharam, Dvādasāksharam are the prominent ones. Initiation into the proper method of pronouncing them and choice of proper environments are said to be essential.
(b) Homam:-This is done by installing the five or the three agnis invoking the assistance of Agni deva. The homam is performed for the Deva whose help the aspirant seeks. This is a tedious process and like the japam demands great patience.
(c) Dhyanam:-This requires great concentration of mind on a particular object for a continuously long period. Hunger, thirst and fatigue have to be overcome. It is possible only for those who have attained great proficiency in Ashtanga Yogam. Yogis are said to visualise the Brahmam which is in every man&rsquo;s heart.
293
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
There are, it is said, dangers attendant in every one of the above. Success depends on the effective control of the mind which has so many distractions. Even the devatas are said to be jealous of the man who reaches great heights in the attempts by the above methods. A false step might land the aspirant in mental disorders, etc. It is like travelling by air where not only the engine disorders but also the atmospheric disturbances result in a disastrous crash.
(d) Archa:-The Archa marga is the fourth path. It is said to be the safest and surest way to attain the goal. Faith in God is the essential requisite for taking to this path. In this method the aspirant gets made an image in as precious a metal as his finances will permit, in as lovely a form as his spiritual ideas and aesthetic taste dictate to be likely form of Saguna Brahmam, sets it up to be his God and fully and firmly believes it to be God. He should offer puja to that Image daily and regularly concentrating his mind on that Image only during worship and become unconscious of what takes place around him during that period. The material form before him helps to concentrate the mind and steadies his faith. Or the aspirant might regularly attend worship being carried on in a temple by a specially trained priest. The grander the manner in which the priest conducts the worship the greater would be the effect on the aspirant. This method has no pitfalls. Even if there should be any break, the aspirant begins again where he left off. In the Kali age which has placed before man so many handicaps and in the ever growing struggle for existence the Archa marga is considered the most suited for man to achieve salvation.</li>
<li>Vyuha Avatars and Vyuha Lokas:-The mythological conception of the region which the jiva has as its goal and the kind of communion with the Paramatma which it offers are also implicitly believed in. The theory is that Paramatma of His Sankalpam brought into existence a huge golden Egg which encloses within it innumerable andams or spheres of which the one in which we live is one. The uppermost andam is known as the Vaishṇavāṇdam. It is to this andam that the liberated jivas, who are therefore called Muktas are conducted after they cast off this mortal frame. In that anḍam Paramātma abides along which certain eternal beings
294
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
known as Nityas, Siddhas and Muktas. This andam is called Vaishnavāṇḍam and is subdivided into four grades of andams, one being above the other in regular succession. They are called Amoda, Pramoda, Sammoda and Vaikunta lokas. Jivas enter first the lowest one of these, viz., Amoda loka and gradually rise to spiritual perfection. To the jiva Paramatma appears in each of these lokas in graded spiritual forms Vishnu, Maha Vishnu, Sadā Vishnu, and Sarva Vyapi Narayana. The perceptible forms of these called amsas are Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha. They are also collectively called Vyuha forms. because they represent graded spiritual conceptions and powers of Paramatman which the jiva masters in four successive stages. Thus the Vyuha Mūrtis are four in number. Besides these four there are said to be as many as twenty four sub-vyuhas some of which have their place in temple worship.</li>
<li>Vibhava Avatars:-The next mythological belief is that the Paramatma manifested Himself in human and other forms to accomplish some specific task or other which was beyond the capacity of man to achieve. These are called Vibhava Avatars which as all know are ten in number. Images made according to the description of these given in the Puranas are worshipped in temples and in homes.</li>
<li>Antaryami:-The other belief is that in every human heart resides Paramatma because he is all pervasive. Yogis are abie to visualise Him in their heart.
Thus Paramatma responds to the prayers of man and helps him in his attempts for salvation in one or the other of the Vyuha, Vibhava: Antaryāmi and archa margas.
Temple worship is based on these beliefs and temple structures are modelled on the story of Cosmogony as given in the Puranas. The Vyuha Murtis and Braham, Sankara, Indra and other devatas play a great part in the rituals of temple worship; and the architectural design of temples provides accommodation for them. The Vyuha theory will be dealt with first and then the cosmogony or story of creation. It will then be clear to the readers how the
295
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
obsolete and the extant forms of temples are both modelled on these ideas.
The Vyuha Theory according to the Vaikhanasas.
There is a contention raised by some Vaikhanasa pandits that the Vyuha theory has no place in their Agama. Bhrigu Samhita however makes it clear that such a contention is due to the misconception that the word Vyūha is not used in (the Telugu edition of) the Marichi Samhita while giving the division of Adi-mürti into four more forms. (Vide. Pages 386 and 387 of
Bhrigu Samhita and 507,508 of Marichi Samhita).
&ldquo;Panchadha tu punar Vyūhah
prochyate Srutisammatah |
Devō Vishnvādibhēdēna
panchadha vyavatishthate !!
The word Vyuha means division into a number of units. It might be asked why the Adi-murti should divide himself into four more parts. The reason given is in the sruti &ldquo;Tad Vishnōs sramapanudaya chaturguna yeti.&rdquo; To remove or obviate the difficulties which the bhaktas have to face in realising Brahmam in full and at one stroke. He divided Himself into four more parts so that the goal might be reached in four stages. The realisation of Brahmam in five stages was taught by Varuna to his son Bhrigu as told in the Taittariya Upanishad-that He is Anna, Prāna, Manas, Vijñāna and Ananda. The Agama Samhitas likewise recommend five stages of realisation of Vishnu, Maha Vishnu, Sada Vishnu and Vyapi Narayana whose amsas are Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha respectively and thereafter the Adi Murti. Mastery of the gunas or virtues which characterise these Vyuha forms and which are known as Dharmam, Jñānam, Aisvaryam and Vairagyam brings about God realisation in four successive stages. The final stage is the realisation of Adi Mürti. The Vaikhanasa theory is that by a continued observance of worship in His Archa form the jiva&rsquo;s attachment to samsara is removed and the Jivātma sees Paramatma in the form of Narayana.
296
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
&ldquo;Tad ärādhanena samsararṇava nimagno
Jivātmā Paramātmānam Nārāyaṇam pasyati.&rdquo;
Ultimately the Jivātma reaches the Divya lokam. There it has the good fortune to serve the Paramatma in four successive ways, viz., Sālōkyam, Samipyam, Särūpyam and Sayujyam. Sālōkyam is obtained while in Amōda lokam. Sāmīpyam in Pramōda lokam; Sārūpyam in Sammōda lokam and Sayujyam in Vaikuntam. Amōdam, Pramōdam, Sammōdam and Vaikuntam are the four lokas in the Vaishnavāṇḍam, in successively higher stages (upary upari).1
So Even after reaching the Vaishnavāṇḍam after divesting oneself of the material body the jivatma has to go through four stages of evolution before it has full realisation of the Paramätman.
(a) Thus in the amodalokam the liberated jivatma gets into the Salokya condition, serves the lowest manifestation of the Adi-murti in the form of Purusha which is the amsa of Vishnu. The Brahma guņam or Virtues of Purusha is Dharmam which therefore becomes the Vishaya guna of the jivātma.
(b) In the next higher lõka of the Vaishnavaṇḍam the Pramoda loka the jiva.ma gets to a nearer approach called Samīpyam and serves the next higher form Satya which is the am a of Maha Vishnu, whose characteristic Brahma guņa is Jñānam (knowledge of the Divine). This jñānam is therefore imbibed in full by the jivatma, or is its Vishaya guna.</li>

Tad Vishnōh paramam padam sada pasyanti sürayah.&rdquo;

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
(c) In the still higher lōka-Sammoda loka-The Jivatma is enabled to discern and serve the form of God in Sarūpya stage This form is that of Sada Vishnu whose amsa is Achyuta having the Brahma guna Aisvaryam In this lõka the jivātma acquies mastery over all things (Isvarat am) Aiswaryam is the Brahma guna of Achyuta and the jivātma shares that as its own Vishaya
guna
(d) In the fourth loka-Vaikuntam-the jivātma attains the Sayujya state, or it becomes, absorbed into Sarva vyapı Nārāyana It then realises that He is in him and he is a part of Him Aniruddha is the amsa of Vyapı Nārāyana and His Brahma guna is Vairagyam which therefore becomes the Vishaya guna of the jivātma complete detachment from everything other than Narayana Thus Dharmam, Jnanam, Aisvaryam and Vairagyam are the four principal Brahma gunas of Paramatma and therefore also the Vishaya gunas of the jivatma.1
Dharmam, Jñanam Aisvaryam and Vanagyam represent one fourth, one half, three quarters and Brahmam in full respectively These are the four legs of the platform or the four planks on which the Dhruva Murti stands or is seated in a temple The Pancha murtis should be contemplated on after receiving initiation by a guru and by ashtanga yoga marga

TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
The Pancharatra Theory of the Vyuhas.
While the Vaikhanasas lay stress on the four Brahma gunas discussed above, the Pancharatras derive the Vyuha forms from another set of six gunas which are inherent in the Paramatma and in every image which represents Him. The two sets of gunas are accepted by the two Agamas. The difference is in giving priority. The Pancharatras represent the four gunas as the four corner-posts of the platform for the Dhruva Murti. These posts are connected together by adharma, ajñāna, anaisvarya and avairagya which necessarily exist in this world. Preference is however given by them to the six gunas (shad gunas) viz., Jnanam, Balam, Aisvaryam, Viryam, Sakti and Tejas. These six gunas are inherent in Paravasudeva and Vyuha Vasudeva. The Vaikhanasas also accept these as inherent gunas of the Adi Mūrti.
66
&lsquo;Nitya Muktaika sambavya-s
chaturbhuja dharo Harih
Anyūnā natirik tai-s-svair
gunai shadbhir alankritah
(Bhrigu Samhita p. 387)
The Pancharatra theory starts with postulating that there is a Sakala Nirguna Brahmam who is called Adi Vasudeva. He has only two hands and one face and is Suddha Sphatika in colour. From Him arises a second Vasudeva (Para Vasudeva) whose abode is in Vaikuntam. He has four hands, one weilding Chakram for Sthiti (protection), one having Padmam for Srishti (creation); one having Sankham or Pancha-janyam for Mukti (moksham); and one having gada for Samhāram (dissolution). Srivatsam and Kaustubham are His lanchanas (distinguishing marks). The former represents Prakriti and the latter is the abhimani devata of the jivātmas. He is seated on the Divine Serpent Sesha having a thousand hoods in a magnificent mantapam in Vaikuntam with Sri Devi on his right side and Bhu Devi on his left. His ashta Saktis (viz., Kanti, Trupti, Sraddha, Vidya, Jaya, Kshama, Santi and Sakti), keep guard at the eight cardinal points. Garuda, Visvaksena, Nityas, and the other Parishadās and Muktas, surround
299HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Him and enjoy the sight. The description of Vaikuntam and the scenery as given in the two Agamas is substantially identical. The six divine gunas (Jnanam, Balam, Aisvaryam, Viryam, Sakti and Tejas) radiate from Him.
From Para Vasudeva two new Murtis arise-Vyuha Vasudeva and Narayana.
Vyuha Vasudeva has inherent in him all the six gunas (jñanam, balm etc.) which characterise Para Vasudeva. In the Vyuha lõkas He represents Para Vasudeva, whereas Nārāyana (the other form emanating from Para Vasudeva) has full responsibility for the Brahmaṇḍa Srishti. The Brahmaṇḍam is mundane and the Vyuha lōkas are super mundane. Vyuha Vasudeva is of Suddha Sphatika (crystal) colour whereas Narayana is of Neela megha colour. Both have four hands, wielding Sankham, Chakram Gada, etc. From Vyuha Vasudeva emanates Sankarshana; from Sankarshana Pradyumna, from Pradyumna arises Aniruddha. These four (Vyuha Vasudeva, Sankarshaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha) Murtis arise in succession from Para Vasudeva and are solely for the enjoyment and benefit of jivatmas who attain moksham and are on the march to Vaikuntam. (There are other emanations called Vyuhantaras or Sub-Vyuhas which we need not consider now). The mukta first comes under the influence of Aniruddha; then of Pradyumna, then of Sankarshana and then to Vyüha Vasudeva acquiring in full at each stage the Divine Gunas which characterise each of these Murtis.1
There is some difference of opinion between Padmasamhita and the later acharyas about the set of guņas which characterise
1 Padma Samhita describes the Vyuha lokas and the Vyuha forms in the following words:-
66
Mahatas tamaso bahye lokas subahuyojanah
Chatvarah kramasas santi chaturbhir samadhisthitah

TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
these Vyuhas. All are agreed that Vyuha Vasueva possesses all the six gunas in full measure, the same as Para Vasudeva. Sankarshana&rsquo;s outstanding gunas are Jñanam and Balam according to the acharyas. The Samhita ascribes Jñanam only. Pradyumna is credited with Aisvaryam and Viryam. The Samhita ascribes Balam. Aniruddha&rsquo;s gunas are Sakti and Tejas. The Samhita allots to Aniruddha Aisvaryam. The Samhita allocates only three guņas-Jñanam, Balam and Aisvaryam, leaving alone the other three. But the acharyas distribute the six gunas into three pairs as shown above. The acharya&rsquo;s views only are the accepted
ones now.

The Special gunas of Aniruddha (viz., Sakti and Tejas) help the spiritual aspirant in the lowest stage. Aniruddha is Rakshaka and He teaches the Tatvas or spiritual principles. Sakti is passive and Tejas is active. In a sense Aniruddha is equated with Ahankaram, and His function is Sthiti. Pradyumna is the next higher Vyuha Murti. His guņas are Aisvaryam and Viryam (one passive and the other active form). He bestows on the aspirant the powers of control over all creative forces and their application. He represents Manas (mind) and does Srishti (creation). Sankarshan has the gunas Jñānam and Balam which are essential for dispelling ignorance and giving mental and moral strength. He represents Samhāram, and the jiva. Jñānam is a passive element and Balam is its active form. These Vyuha forms and what they connote form part of speculative metaphysics. These Vyüha rūpas are

meant only for the Upasaka to meditate upon for acquiring the gunas or qualities attributed to the forms. They mean no more.1
(Sri Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s Rahasyatraya Saram p. 248. Sri Chetlur Narasimhachari&rsquo;s edition).
The injunction given is that for archa purposes these six gunas are always present not only in mantrams but in bimbams (or images) also and that it should be so considered in fact and not as fiction. Those who do Sandhya and Japa know that as a necessary preliminary to the mental recitation of the mantra anganyasam is done by associating syllables of the mantram with these six gunas and by locating them in certain parts of the body.

As a matter of fact these guņas should invariably be represented on every murti representing the Vyuha Vasudeva or Para Vasudeva form. It is so in Tirumala where the Kautuka Murti (Bhoga Srinivasa) has under His feet and on the pitam a yantram. This yantram takes the form of two interlaced equal equilateral triangles one being the invert of the other. The angular points may be taken to represent a guna and the pair of opposite ones representing the dynamic and the kinetic gunas.

Just as the Vaikhanasa theory postulates the existence of four Vyuha lokas in the Vaishnavanda presided over by Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha; the Pancharatra theory has set up four Vyuha lokas presided over by Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarshana and Vyuha Vasudeva. Both speculate on what awaits the aspirant for moksham after death. Neither is connected with this material universe or Brahmaṇḍam.
Even as part of speculative philosophy or metaphysics the ideas are given a concrete shape in temples and the mental conception has been represented as Murtis therein. Such temples will be described at some length presently.
In the method of representation the rationale of the two agamas seem to differ. The Vaikhanasas place Purusha (the lowest of the Vyuhas) in the first enclosure surrounding the Mula Murti, on the south side of the east face facing the east. The next higher
303
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
form Satya will be abutting the south wall of the Garbha griham facing south; Achyuta on the west facing west and Aniruddha on the north facing north. Aniruddha is the higgest form (in the Vaikhanasa System) and is the amsa of Vyapi Nārāyana. The Pancharatras place Vyūha Vasudeva, (the highest of the Vyuha forms) in the east just where the Vaikhanasas place Purusha the lowest form. On the south will be Sankarshana (next lower than Vyuha Vasudeva) in the place where Satya (the second from the lowest) is placed by the Vaikhanasa. Thus the reverse order is observed by the Pancharatras. Commencing from the east the Vaikhanasas place the Vyuhas in ascending order and clockwise. The Pancharatras place their Vyuhas in descending order. Worshippers going to the temple would first make a pradakshinam or perambulation of the avaranam clockwise. They would worship the Vyuhas in the ascending order if the images are of the Vaikhanasa theory. If of the Pancharatra theory they will go to the lowest murti just before going into the Sanctum Sanctorum to worship the Mula Beram. While making archana and food offering the archaka will have to go the other way. These incongruities lead to the suspicion that in practice these difficulties would have been felt. The representation of the Vyuhas as images does not appear to have been in practice during the days of the Alvārs. No Alvar refers to them in his songs. There seems to exist no temple in Southern India where the Vyuha images are exhibited in the first avaranam. Their names alone are recited in the course of the rituals. Therefore so far as the lay worshipper is concerned there is no difference between the two Agamas.
There were however temples of different types dedicated to the Vyuha Murtis more or less exclusively. They were designed to present to our view what awaits us when we cross this ocean of Samsaram and reach the Transcendental Sphere called Vaishnavandam.
Cosmogony according to Vishnu Paranam.
We now pass on to the story of creation of our universe bristling with life in its numerous forms. We find ourselves floundering
304
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
and swirling in the ocean of Samsaram. The Puranas and the Agamas tell us why we happen to be here and what we should do to cross this ocean. The Puranas tell us that we are not alone in this ocean. There are countless jivatmas in various stages of spiritual development endowed with different types of bodies suited to their advancement and in the lokas which they inhabit. The original cause of our being mixed up in this conglomerate is not any original sin, since the jiva in its pristine condition and when reaching its goal is sinless. It is however the Divine will or Sankalpam that we should play our part in creation and find the way out also. Why there should be a creation and a dissolution of the universe it is not for us to divine. The story as is told in our Puranas we fully believe in. The Agamas tell us that by the worship of God with sincere Bhakti and by securing the help and co-operation of all other forms of life in this universe,-the cooperation of the spiritually more advanced beings and the noninterference of the spiritually less advanced so that no obstacles are placed in our path-we could cross this ocean and enjoy the bliss in Heaven as all muktas do. This is why the Puranic story of creation and dissolution has been embodied in our temple structures and several images installed therein. The Agamas tell us how Baddhas could raise themselves to the stature of Muktas.
The theory is that after the last complete dissolution called Panchabhautika Pralayam all the Jivatmas and Prakriti lay preserved and protected by Sriman Narayana in and as part of His own Body as He lay on His serpent bed (Sesha).1
The four-faced Brahma endowed with the amsa (or powers) of Narayana came out of the Nabhipadmam of Bhagavan for the purpose of creating all this universe (jagat sarvam srijatīti.). This universe is therefore called Brahmandam or Brahma Srishti.</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Brahma Srishti.
Although during the Panchabhautika Pralayam, Prakriti and all Jivas got reduced to an impalpable and indistinguishable state, each jiva carried with it the seeds of its past karma (actions). It was in this condition that the jivas lay in the womb or body of Narayana duly protected. When He willed to recreate the universe, Mula Prakriti or Primeval Matter appeared transformed as Mahat. The next evolutes in succession are Buddhi, Ahankaram, the Indriyas, the Tanmatras and the Pancha Bhūtas (Ākāsa, 、Vāyu, Tējas, Ap and Prithivi). These terms are so well known that no explanation is necessary. Ahankaram takes three forms owing to the interaction of the three gunas Satva, Rajas and Tamas. The Indriyas are said to arise from Satvik Ahankaram. All the evolutes combine and intermingle in myriads of ways, which is called Panchi karanam. The jivātma is enmeshed therein as the consequence of its past Karma. It is this heterogeneous mass or conglomerate that comes out of the navel of Narayana at the time of every creation as a huge golden egg having seven sheaths inside which the fourfaced Brahma is seated on the Padmam flower. Brahma is the foremost (spiritually the most advanced) of all jivas and therefore is their representative (jivasamaşti). Since every jiva has to its credit the result of all previous karma, its place in the new creation is predetermined and Brahma only calls the jiva to its appointed place. Thus Rudra, Indra, Varuna etc., Sanaka Sanatkumara and all the others practically jump each into his place. By devolution of powers from Narayana Brahma is Divine. So also are Rudra, Indra and the other Devas. But technically all of them have been created by Brahma.
The order of Brahma Srishti.
Brahma first created plant life (or Sthavara Srishti) whose predominant characteristic is Tamōgunam. The next higher form of life which was created is animal life (Tiryak Srishti) which is also of Tamōgunam. As he cogitated on creating a better type of life there came out of the upper portion of his body beings endowed with Satva guna and therefore full of atma jñānam.
306
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
They lived in the air and did not like this earth. Although Brahma was quite pleased with this creation (called urdhva surōtas or Devas) it did not serve the purpose of peopling this world. Therefore from out of the mid portion of his body he created men who preferred to be in this world. This creation was subject to the influence of Satva, Rajas and Tamo gunas and therefore some times feeling happy and some times feeling unhappy. This creation is known as Arväksurōtas. All the above said beings possess the qualities or gunas known as Avidya, Asakti, Santushți and Siddhi and therefore are known collectively as Anugraha srishti.
Then he created Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara and the Rudras. They were of superior type and did not serve the purpose of propogating this world. This Srishti is called Kaumara Srishti.
The superior type of life is divided into four classes: Dēva, Asura, Pitri and Manushya. Jivas were created in one of these classes as befitting their past Karma. Asuras predominated by Tamōguna were born from below the waist of Brahma; Devas predominated by Satva guna were born from his mukham or forehead. The Pitri devatas who are also characterised by Satva guna were born from his sides. The asuras were born by night, the Devas by day and the Pitris in evening twilight. Men endowed with Rajoguna came out of the body of Brahma in morning twilight (dawn). Brahma assumed different bodies for the creation of each of these forms of life. From another body of his and when he was in an angry and hungry mood were born by night beings having ugly and hideous forms. Those who cried for food or Jaksha were called Yakshas and those who cried for protection (Raksha) were called Rakshasas. Then from his tuft which fell down came serpents (Ahis) of lowly origin. As he was in bad temper at that time, there came into existence numerous Bhutas of dark colour subsisting on flesh and blood.
When he regained his temper he created the Gandharvas who sang gaily. Then were created several kinds of birds and beasts and useful drugs. Brahma also brought into existence from his east face the Gayatri Chandas, Rigveda, Trivrit Stoma, Rathantara Saman and Agnistöma; from His South face came
307
HISTORY GF TIRUPATI
Trishtup Chandas, Yajur Veda, Panchadasastöma, Brihat Säman and Ukthyam of yagñas. From His west forehead came Jagati Chandas, Sama Veda, Saptadasa Stoma and Vairupam of Samans. From his north face came Anushtup Chandas, Atharva Vēda, Ēkavimsa Stoma, Vairājam of Samans and the yagnām known as Aptōryǎmam.
Brahma Srishti has to be related here in great detail because the story has been reproduced in the various prākārams and in the garbhagriham of our temples.
Creation of Rudras.
All the attempts which Brahma made so far did not satisfy his expectations to multiply life fast enough in this world. So he went again into the creative mood and from his mind brought forth nine sons each one of whom excelled Brahma in intelligence, character and ability. They are collectively known as Nava Brahmas; and their names are Bhrigu, Pulastya, Kratu, Angiras, Marichi, Atri, Daksha, Vasishta and Narada. They were full of vairāgyam and took to moksha märgam. They had no inclination to multiply human life. Brahma felt chagrined at his failure, and knit his eye-brows in great anger. From his irate fore-head and at noon sprang forth an irate Rudra with the brilliance of a thousand suns. His form was however half male and half female (Ardhanärisvara). Brahma felt unhappy about this hermaphrodite Mürți and ordered that he should at once separate the male from the female form. In doing so the male form divided itself into eleven Rudras and the female form assumed numerous shapes some being saumya, some hideous, some santasvarupam, some ugly, some of black and some of fair complexion.
For the protection and governance of this world he converted himself into a king by name Svayambu Mann who married Satarupa which form Brahma&rsquo;s wife took. The above is a short account of what is given in the Vishnu Puranam. In short Brahma created Indra and all the other Devas and devatas, the Asuras, Pitris, Rishis, Manushyas, &lsquo;Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Rakshasas,
308
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Yakshas, Bhútas, Pisachas, Beasts and Birds, Serpents and all the Sthavara and Jangama life. He created also Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanat kumara the Nava Brahmas; Rudra in his eleven forms, and Svayambhu Manu.
The life time of Indra and the Devas, Saptarishis, Vasu Rudra Adityas and the Manus is called a Manvantaram. In mānusha years it is equivalent to thirty crores sixty seven lakhs and twenty thousand years. Fourteen such manvantarams make one day time (half a day) of Brahma. At the commencement of each manvantaram Indra and the other Devatas are created simultaneously and their life also ends simultaneously at the end of the manvantaram At the close of each day of Brahma an interim dissolution or Naimittika pralayam of the three worlds, Bhur, Bhavar and Suvar, takes place by fire. Unable to bear the heat the inhabitants of Mahar Loka take refuge in the next higher lõkam called Janōlakam where reside all great Yogis. A fresh Srishti of these three lokas is done by Brahma. All this is one day&rsquo;s work for Brahma. Counted by this unit Brahma&rsquo;s life period is one hundred years at the end of which the Mahapralayam (Pancha bhautika pralayam) takes place. This difference between the Devatas, Brahma, Rudra and the munis accounts for the different åvaranams in which their images are placed in temples. This will be explained in due course. An inspection of the two charts showing the avaranams and the devatas therein will also satisfy the curiosity of the reader.
309CHAPTER XII.
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS.
SECTION II.
Different Types of Agama Temples.
IN the design of temples, in the arrangement of the images
therein and in the orderly manner of the daily puja and the annual festival, the Agamas follow closely the description given in the Puranas of the mythology and metaphysics of cosmogony. The aim of the Agamas is to indicate clearly the way to attain moksham, or emancipation of the Jivatma from this world. The normal course involves a long journey though the seven lokas in a series of births. In this course by successive stages it could rise from being a man to becoming an Indra or even Brahma. Thereafter the liberated Jivatma enters the Vaishnavanḍam in its lowest plane and rises by four stages to that level where it becomes identified with the Adi Murti. The temple structures, particularly the åvaranams of the temples, we now see, represent these stages of this world and of the Vaishnavandam. There were however temples of different types of construction, each type being best suited for a particular form of worship. Excepting the type wihch is current now the others are obsolete forms. They will all be briefly described as they serve to indicate the lines of development of our spiritual conceptions.
Classification of the types of temples.
(a) The Vertical type. One type which probably was the earliest depicted the Vaishnavanḍam wherein the liberated souls going through their spiritual development in that andam worship the Adi murti in his Vyuha forms. All the temples of this conception represent the Murtis in shrines which rise one above the other
310
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
vertically. The ideal temple of this type will consist of twelve tiers. The idea of having twelve tiers might have been taken from the tradition that the golden Vimanam in Vaikuntam consists of twelve tiers. A temple of this type would have risen to a height of about one hundred and twenty feet and was called a dvādasa tala alayam. The more common ones consisted of two or three tiers. The Agama also contemplates a single floor temple of this type in which nine murtis would be arranged clock-wise. The Murtis for worship will be the Vyuha forms and some of the outstanding Vibhava forms. Brahma and Siva do not appear to have claimed a prominent place in these alayams, although they received (according to the current form of temple worship) their nyasa flowers in the worship of every one of the nine murtis.
There is not even a relic of this type in South India. Perhaps some were built in North India or in the Himalayan regions where our Aryan ancestors first lived and where the Rig Veda had its birth. The subsoil for the foundations of the temples should have been hard rock.
Horizontal Types (b and c).
(b) The Trimurti and Dvimurti Temples. One floor type.
On the same floor-level temples were constructed to instal and worship separately Vishnu, Brahma and Rudra; or Vishnu and Rudra only. There are a few such temples in South India.
(c) The Ekamurti temple having one to seven avaranams or enclosures.
This type is the commonest one now and has survived the test of time. In this type the representation of the Vyuha murtis and some of the Vibhava forms was in vogue. Brahma, Rudra, Markandeya and Bhrigu were installed in the garbha griham as parivara devatas, although they are only spiritually advanced Jivātmās. This type and the single floor Nava murti ālayam already mentioned under the vertical type are substantially the same. In course of time (probably due to altered metaphysical
311
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
and philosophic conceptions) the representation of Brahma and Rudra as images was given up, although in the rituals they are mentally served as before.
The description given in the Marichi Samhita of these types will be briefly summed up.
Nava-Shat-Pancha murti alayam.
Temples of this type are recommended for places where more than one thousand learned brahmins live. They may be built in three tiers or two tiers or on the ground floor alone. The overall dimensions of the building would range from nine hastams square to sixty one hastams square in arithmetical progression of two hastams to each side. Thus each side of the square would be 9, 11, 13, 15 to 61 hastams. There could therefore be twenty seven sizes of temples. Temples of a size less than 9 hastams side are also permitted. But they would be so small that kautuka berams for all the nine, six or even five murtis could not conveniently be given accommodation. So they will have to be placed in alcoves in the garbhagriham (abhyantaram) walls.
The lay-out of the temple would be as follows. Divide each side into nine equal parts and stretch lines across in both directions. This will gave 81 equal small squares. The nine squares in the centre would be reserved for the garbhagriham. Sixteen small squares surrounding the former symmetrically will be for the construction of the garbhagriham walls. Twenty four squares surrounding the above would be left free. Thirty two squares surrounding this space will be for building the outer walls all round. The walls of the garbhagriham are called abhyantara bhitti and the outer walls are called &lsquo;Bahya bhitti,&rsquo; both being Sanskrit words for the inner and outer walls. There will be a doorway left in the middle of the east inner wall and four doorways in the middle of each of the four outer walls. All this round about description boils down to stating that each side of the garbhagriham will be three hastams; wall thickness one hastam and the width of the corridor round it one hastam. This allocation holds good whether
312
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
the temple has three or two tiers or is only a ground floor structure. The sketch attached hereto will make the description clear. In the sketch there is a compound wall also shown surrounding the temple and mukhamandapam. The compound wall is called Bähya kuḍyam (again a Sanskrit word). The corridor space left between the abhyantaram and the Bahya bhitti walls is called Alindram.&rsquo;
If the temple is built in three tiers it is called a Tritala alayam; if in two tiers, dvitalam and if only on the ground floor it is called Ēka-talam.
Tritala Nava murti alayam.
In this type the centrally situated twenty five squares, (which is the same thing as saying the space allotted for the garbhagriham and the abhyantaram walls) will be left vacant without any mürti being placed therein. On the other hand the ground floor would be built substantially so as to act as a sound foundation and basement for the second and the third tiers. On all the four sides of the Alindram (or corridor) the Vyuha murtis will be installedPurusha in the east wing, Satya in the south wing, Achyuta in the west wing and Aniruddha in the north wing. There will be a flight of steps leading to the second tier. The Bahya Bhitti walls will have large openings in each wing and be provided with jalakam (or trellis pattern bay window) so that the murtis installed in the Alindram could be seen from the mukha mantapam in front of each. (The Sketch will be easier to understand than wordy descriptions.) In the second tier would be installed the Dhruva Murti (Adi Murti) in the central garbhagriham space facing the cast. In the corridor space surrounding this (called Alindram) would be installed, practically resting against the wall, the images of Naranarayana on the south wing; Nrsimha on the west and Varaha on the north. There will be parapat walls,mantapam and a flight of steps(Sōpānam) to the third tier. In the central portion of the third tier (which would be of the same dimensions as in the second tier) will be installed the Sayana murti in Bhoga Sayanam on Sesha: All the Murtis will be Bahirmukham or facing outwards.
313
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
If the Tritala alayam is meant to instal only six murtis, then the installation of Nara Narayana, Nrisimha and Varaha would be omitted. There will be no other change.
Dvitala alayam.
In this type the Adi murti Vishnu would be installed in the ground floor (Atha-s-talam) in the middle space (nine small squares) in Bhoga asan posture. In the Alindram surrounding the garbha griham the Vyuha murtis would be installed as described already with this difference that Purusha Murti would be to the south of the east door way of the garbha griham abutting the Abhyantaram wall. All will face outwards. In the second tier, in the central space will be installed the yoga sayana murti.
Pancha Murti alayam-dvitalam.
Adi murti Vishnu would be installed in the second tier. On the ground floor Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha as before on the four sides obtained either by blocking up the central nine squares alone or the central twenty five squares. All the murtis would face outwards.
If it is found difficult to have separate Vimanams over each of the Dhruva Murtis, the Eka tala temple might be provided with a single Vimanam so as to cover the entire space occupied by all the Murtis.
Eka tala Eka Vimana Nava-Shat Pancha Murti alayam.
The type is a cheap alternative and could be constructed so as to be less than 9 hastams square, if so desired. The sides would be divided into nine equal parts each way so as to give 81 equal small squares. Or each side might be divided into 11 equal parts, resulting in the formation of 121 equal small squares. In either case the central 25 squares will be allotted for the garbhagriham and the abhyantaram walls. According to the second

method the Alindram would get 56 squares and Bahir bhithi 40 squares. In other words the garbha griham will be three units square, the abhyantaram wall and the Bahir bhithi one unit thick and the alindram would get a little more space. The Adi murti d the Vyuha murtis would be installed as before. Nara Narayana, would be near the south west end of the south face of the alindram; Nrisimha near the North West end of the west face and Varaha near the North West end of the north face. The Sayana murti would be placed against the east wall of the alindram to the north of the main doorway. We have seen that Purusha would be to the south of the same doorway on the east face. This arrangement will make up the Eka tala Eka Vimana Nava murti ålayam. If Nara Narayana, Nrisimha and Vāraha are omitted it becomes the same type Shan murti ālayam. If Sayana murti also is dispensed with it becomes a Pancha murti alayam. These arrangements are shown in the attached sketch (already referred to). There would be a main mukha mantapam on the east side as shown; there might also be smaller ones on the other three sides. There might be four gopurams (one on each side) in the middle of the compound walls, or only onc on the east side.
These types are all out of date. There seems to be only one in Uttara Merür in the Chingleput District which was probably the work of the Pallava King Mahendra Varman also known as Vichitra Chittan, which appellation well describes all his strange ideas. The space available in the Ēka tala Ēka Vimana Nava Shat Pancha murti alayam is so limited that it was felt difficult to instal all the Dhruva Murtis and their respective Kautuka berams. The Agama therefore permits the placing of the Kautuka berams in alcoves (or recesses) in the abhyantara walls near each Vyuha Murti, or even to omit the Kautuka berams altogether. The installation of the images of Brahma, Rudra and the others would therefore have been out of the question.
All the above types are intended to present to us the conditions subsisting in the Vaishnavaṇḍam only.
315
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Dvadasa Tala alayam (Twelve tiers Vertical type.)
This is the most ambitious variety of the vertical type. A comparison of the description of this variety with the seven prākāram temple of the horizontal type which the chart enclosed to this chapter shows will give the impression that the two are not very different from each other. The horizontal type is only a projection of the vertical type on a horizontal plane.
The ground floor of this variety of temple will be massive in construction so that it could carry all the load transmitted by the eleven floors above it. It will have halls (Kutams) and verandahs for sheltering worshippers, for storing materials etc. But no Murti will be installed on this floor. The other floors will have in addition to the garbhagriham for the murti, alindrams, antarālams, mukhamantapams, parapet walls, sōpanams, kūtams and sālās. The location of the garbha grihams is compared to the holes in a flute (Vēnu randhravat garbhōpari garbha griham).
In the second tier will be installed the image of Sarva vyapi Narayana in the Sayana posture.
In the third tier will be installed Sada Vishnu in the asina posture; in the fourth tier Maha Vishnu in the Sthanaka (standing) posture.1 In the fifth ther the following devatas will be installed in clockwise order commencing from the east, Dik-palas, Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Maruts, Asvins, Sapta rishis, Sapta rohins, Matru ganas and all Devas. In the sixth tier on the east side facing the east will be Sanakam, Subhadram, Mitram, Sanatanam arranged from south to north; on the south side facing the south will be Sukhavaham Hayatmakam, Atri, and Sarvam arranged from west to east; on the west side facing the west will be Sanandanam, Rāma dēvam, Sivam and Sanat kumaram arranged from south to north; On</li>
<li>In the Kamakshiamman temple in Kanchipuram there is a variant of this type. The ground floor is of massive construction. In the first, second and third floor are the Sthanaka, Asina and Sayana Murtis. They are now being treated as three separate tomples in counting the 18 Sthalams in Kanchipuram.
316
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
the north side facing north will be Samvaham, Punyam, Visvam and Suvaham arranged from west to east.
In the seventh tier the Deva will be represented in the Vijaya krida rupam in all the eight directions and in the garbha griham.
In the eighth tier the arrangement is as follows-on the east side Pancha Viran in the middle with Raghavam to his right and Krishnan to his left; on the south side Nrisimham in the middle with Vamanam to the east and Trivikramam to the west; on the west side Varaham in the middle with Parasuraman to the south and Balabhadran to the north; on the north side Kalki in the middle with Kurma rupam to the west and Matsyatmakam to the east.
In the nineth tier within the eight sided garbhagriham will be installed in order commencing from the east (and going clockwise) eight of the Vibhava avatars, viz., Nrisimham, Vamanam, Trivikramam, Parasuraman, Sri Rama, Bala Rama, Krishna and Kalki.
In the tenth tier, there will be, commencing from the east, Purusha, Kapila, Satya, Yagna, Achyuta, Narayana, Aniruddha and Punya at the eight corners.
In the eleventh tier Adi murti Vishnu will be in garbha griham; while in the alindram will be Nara Narayana on the south face, Narasimham on the west face and Varaham on the north face
In the twelfth tier there will be the Sayana Murti in Bhujanga Sayanam.
It will be seen from the above description that the Tritala nava murti alayam gets gradually higher and higher up as an additional tala is added at the lower end. To decrease the tala by one, the deletion should be at the ground floor end, leaving the ground floor construction undisturbed. This type is only of academic interest to us.
There is yet another variety of temple in which the martis arranged vertically. The Sayanamurti occupies the lower tier,
317
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the asina or sitting murti the mid floor and the Sthanaka or standing murti the top tier; or vise versa. (Perhaps the Undavalli cave temple on the banks of the Krishna near Vijayawada is of this type). This is also an obsolete type.
The Dvi and Trimurti Alayams on ground floor.
In the Dvi murti alayam Vishnu and Sankara are installed in separate shrines, each shrine having its own pradakshinam (or antarmandalam).
The two murtis would be to the right or left of each other, both facing the east. Or Vishnu alayam might be to the west of that of Sankara. Then Vishnu would face east and Sankara west. They will have a common temple with common prakaram. The temples in Upper Ahobilam, Srimushnam and Chidambaram might be considered as examples of this type. Such temples are however uncommon. The temple in Sri Nammalvar&rsquo;s birth place, Tirukkurukur, (Alvar Tirunagari), is one such.
There are a number of temples sung by the alvars where Sankara is stationed in the garbha griham of Vishnu. Although the Sthalapuranas now say that in answer to the prayer of Sankara, Vishnu appeared there, the fact might be that these are Dvimurti alayams.
The Tri Murti Alayam.
The shrines of Vishnu, Sankara and Brahma will be separate. each having its own antarmandalam; but all of them will be in one compound having common set of compound walls. The arrangement of the Murtis is entirely a matter of discretion. Any one might be in the middle and the other two on either side in any order. This kind of temple is of rare occurrence. Sri Nammalvar&rsquo;s description of the temple in Tiruchchengunrür chitrătrănkarai (திருச்செங்குன்றூர் சிற்றாற்றங்கரை) in Malai nādu bordering on Tiruvankur shows that temple as belonging to this type. His songs testify to his high appreciation of the amity that
318TEMPLLS AND THE AGAMAS
prevailed among the three thousand highly learned brahmins in worshipping daily all the three murtis on equal basis. It appears that the temple in Suchindram (Tamil Nadu) is also of this type. The archaeological remains of the cave temple in Mandagappattu point to that having been a Trimurti temple constructed by Mahendra Varman (Vichitra Chitta) about 650 A.D.
Temples and temple worship have not been a tame and dreary affair. There has been life in it.

SECTION III.
The Ekatala Ekamurti alayam.
HAVING described all the obsolete types of Agama temples,
the one type which we are and which our ancestors in South India have been accustomed to from at least the Seventh Century A.D., when cut-stone temple structures may be said to have commenced will now be described. It is the view of some Agama pandits that all the types including ours were in use at all times in the past and that the survival of what is current is a matter of accident. If however we carefully analyse and compare the present design of a temple with the design of an Eka tala Eka vimana Nava Shat Pancha murti älayam, we have every reason to conclude that the present type is the natural evolution of the Nava Shat Pancha murti alayam. We shall first describe the design of the current type.
The Eka tala Eka mürti alayam is not only confined to a single floor but is also dedicated to the worship of a single Dhruva Murti and its Kautuka Beram. Its Vimanam covers only the garbha griham. A simple design of a skeleton temple (Ekatala Eka Murti) of the current type is shown in the annexed sketch. The garbha griham and the mukha mantapam, which is its antechamber, form an integral structure up to the roof. The Vimanam would cover only the garbha griham, its walls and the terrace. Mukha mantapam will have only the terraced roof. The width of the mukha mantapam would be about the same as that of the garbha griham; but its length would be such that the area of its floor space equals the area of the Vimanam at its base. When the murti to be installed is in the standing or sitting posture the

garbha griham would be square in shape. The floor space (and therefore one side of this square space) is usually calculated after deciding on the area of the base of the vimanam (which determines the height of the vimanam also). The rule of thumb practice is to make the area of the garbha griham 1/3, 2/4, 3/5, 4/7, 5/9 or 6/11th part of the base area of the Vimanam. In the design of the Nava Shat Pancha murti alayam (Eka tala Eka Vimanam) the rule was much cruder still. For a nine hastam square alayam the floor space of the garbha griham would be 1/9th part of the area of the alayam itself, or, 9/25th part of the base area of the vimanam. There will be an open space left at the terrace level on all the sides of these two structures (excepting on the front side) which space is called Antaralam. This open space separates the two structures from the corridor which surrounds them on all sides. This corridor is called the Antarmandalam.&rsquo; The antarmandalam corresponds to the alindram of the Nava Shat Pancha murti älayam. The roof of the antarmandalam is carried on walls on the outer side and on a row of stone pillars on the inner side on the three sides excepting the front. The slope of the terrace would be outwards. On the front side the antarmandalam widens into an Ardha mantapam or Snapana mantapam and is also called Vesaram. Right below the antarālam opening and at the ground level there will be a fairly wide cutstone drain running round the three sides. The drainage water from the garbha griham will find its ways into this drain by an outlet in the north wall of the garbha griham having a carved face, like the face and mouth of a cow and therefore called Gomukham. The rain water flowing down the Vimanam will also fall into this drain. All the drainage water will be led into the Pushkarini or the holy tank which is usually situated on the north side of the temple and near the outer-most Prakaram or compound wall. No part of the roof of the corridor (Antarmandalam) will rest on or have contact with the garbha griham walls. On the front side the corridor roof would rest on the east wall of the mukha mantapam.
It will be seen that the garbha griham, the mukha mantapam and the antarmandalam have doorways placed centrally on the east side only. Attached to the east face of the antarmandalam will be an asthana mantapam used for festival purposes. This
21
321
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
mantapam would be an open cutstone structure carried on 16, 32, or 64 pillars.
It is usual to have the shrine of Garuda (the Divine Eagle) in the middle of the eastern fringe of the above mantapam. The Dhvajastambham and Balipitham would be to the east of this Shrine. There are however alternative sites assigned for these which will be explained later.
The walls of the antarmandalam are also known as the first åvaranam or prākaram walls. There will be a fairly wide quadrangular open space running round these walls and the asthānam mantapam. This space is enclosed by another set of quadrangular walls (massive and high) known as the second prakaram or avaranam walls. There will be one wide and high opening on the east wall, corresponding to the doorways in the garbha griham, mukha mantapam and the first avaranam but very much higher and wider giving an imposing appearance. The roof will be surmounted by a gopuram. The opening is usually called a mukhadvaram. Very many temples are content with having this second avaranam, its mukhadvāram and gōpuram. A few have another set of quadrangular walls, mukhadvāram and gopuram with the open space between the second wall and this one made much wider than the second avaranam space.
These three avaranams play an important part in the daily rituals of worship. Important Devas and Devatas are presumed to occupy their allotted places therein. Although at one time they were represented by images it is not the practice now. A chart showing these three avaranams and the Devatas at their appropriate places is appended to this chapter.
The quadrangular open space between the avaranam walls is not left entirely open to the sky. There are a number of built structures required for the daily routine of the temple. The space actually left open to the sky is called Antaralam.
Points of difference between the Eka tala Eka murti alayam (current type) and the Eka tala Eka Vimana Nava shat pancha Alayammurti (the obsolete) type.

(a) In the current type the antarmandalam surrounding the garbhagriham is very much wider than the alindram of the obsolete type. The alindram formed an integral part of the alayam along with the garbhagriham, the terrace being continuous without openings. But the present antarmandalam is a separate structure detached from the garbhagriham by an open space (antarālam) at the roof level. The Vimanam of the obsolete type covered the alindram space also. In the current type the Vimanam covers the garbhagriham only.
(b) The mukha mantapam in the obsolete type stood outside the alindram of the alayam. But in the current type the mukha mantapam is next to the garbha griham and the antarmanḍalam encloses the mukha mantapam also.
(c) In the obsolete temple there were the Vyüha images of Purusha, Satya, Achyuta, Aniruddha; the Vibhava images of Nara Narayana, Nrisimha and Varaha and the Bhujanga Sayana murti, all arranged along the four sides of the alindram. In the current type the antarmandalam is left empty or unoccupied by any of these images; but Vishvaksena is assigned a place in the north wing of the antarmandalam near to the foot of the Vimanam corner. In the nava-shat-pancha murti alayam Vishvaksena was not given a place in the alindram. The Vaikhanasa Agama recommends painted representation. (Präsädabhimukham chitra chiträrtham äbhasam) of the ten avatars of Vishnu on the walls of the antarmandalam and for purposes of archa, kanuka images also in front of each. This recommendation however did not gain currency (vide 21st patalam, Marichi Samhita; Telugu edition).
(d) The Vyüha murtis were worshipped daily as images in the alindram. In the current temple the worship of these has reduced itself to the offering of a nyasa flower during Nityarchana of the Dhruva Murti, while mentioning the name of each Vyuha mürti and depositing the same between the feet of the Dhruva Murti.
(e) In the current type Brahma and Siva were at one time (although not now) represented by separate images in the
323
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
garbha griham one on either side of the Dhruva Murti; and Garuda and Visvaksena in other parts of the alayam proper. In the obsolete type there was really no room for these, even if we wish to assume that they were represented. The seven avaranams of a temple are not mentioned in connection with the obsolete type. It is only in the dvadasa tala alayam of the vertical type some of the parivara devatas are represented as occupying separate tiers.
In spite of all these differences there is a strong resemblance between the obsolete and the current type. In the obsolete type the worshippers were obliged to stand in the mukha mantapam which was outside the alindram and therefore far away to have a clear view of the Dhruva Murti. But once the alindram was cleared of the Vyuha murtis it was found feasible to shift the mukha mantapam to be very near the Dhruva Murti. The desire would have been felt natural. The present type appears therefore to be the successor to the obsolete type.

GARBHAGRIHAM, VIMANAM AND
PARIVARA DEVATAS.
Garbhagara Pada Vinyasam.
IHE division of the floor space of the &lsquo;garbha griham into four zones, each outer zone surrounding the next inner one is called in the language of the Agamas, Garbhāgara Pada Vinyāsam. This division is made so that the images in the garbha griham may be arranged in the order which the Agamas prescribe. If the temple is consecrated for installing a Dhruva Murti and a Kautuka Bēram the division will be in one way; if there is no Kautuka Bēram and a Dhruva Murti alone is installed and worshipped the division is effected in a different manner. The four zones are named thus. The central zone is called Brahmyam: the one which surrounds it is called Daivikam; the third zone which surrounds the Daivikam is called Manusham; the outermost one is called Paisacham. The import of these terms is so patent that no lengthy explanation is necessary. If the temple has in the garbha griham a Dhruva Murti and its Kautuka Beram, the Kautukam should be installed in the central zone called Brahmyam. Most part of the daily archana will be to the Kautuka Beram and through it to the Dhruva Murti. If the temple was consecrated without the Kautukam, then the Dhruva Murti would occupy the Brahmyam space. All archana would be done to the Dhruva Murti directly. Two sketches are drawn marked (a) and (b). Sketch (a) shows the arrangement when there is a kautukam and Sketch (b) shows the arrangement when there is no kautukam.
Sketch (a) Dhruva Murti and Kautukam installed-Each side of the square floor is divided into i6 equal parts &lsquo;and lines

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
drawn across to mark the divisions. There will thus be seen on the floor 256 small squares (16x16). Sixteen small squares which are right in the centre form the Brahma Sthanam or Brahmyam where the Kautukam will be placed. The next eighty four small squares surrounding the Brahmyam will form the zone called Daivikam, so called because the Deva (or Dhruva Murti) would be placed within that zone. This zone will be sub-divided into three sub-zones by drawing lines across at equal intervals. The Dhruva Murti if in the standing posture would occupy the rear third part of this zone. If in the sitting posture He would occupy in addition to the above rear third part a portion of the next zone which is called Manusham. If He is in the Sayana posture much more of the Manusham would be occupied as well.
Ninety six small squares surrounding the Daivikam will form the Manusham zone. The outer most zone is called Paisacham and is formed by the remaining 60 small squares.
Sketch (b) no Kautukam installed:-In this case the Dhruva Murti will be in the Brahma Sthānam.1 The floor space is divided into 49 equal small squares by dividing each side into 7 equal parts and drawing lines across on the floor. It will be seen that of the 49 small squares there is one small square centrally placed. This is the Brahmyam where the Dhruva Murti will be installed and worshipped directly. Eight small squares surrounding the Brahma Sthanam will form the Daivikam zone (3x3-1=8). Sixteen small squares surrounding the Daivikam will make up the Manusham zone (5×5-3x3-16). The remaining twenty four squares will form the Paisacha zone. If the Dhruva Murti is in the sitting posture a portion of the Daivikam will also be appropriated. Similarly a portion of the Manusham if in Sayana posture.
In addition to the Dhruva and the Kautuka Murtis there will be other images to be accommodated. Brahma will be to</li>

the right side of the Dhruvam and Rudra on the left side. The former would occupy the Manusham zone and the latter partly Manusham and partly Paisacham zone. The allocation of the zone for the Dhruva Murti (according to Sketch b) is also dependant on the type of Vimanam over the garbha griham. If of the Paushtika type() the Murti will be placed in the Daivikam zone; if of the Santika type He will be in the Brahma Sthanam; and if of the Jayada type partly on the Daivikam and partly on the Manusham zone. It will be noted that in the arrangement when the Vimanam is Paushtika or Jayada the Brahma Sthanam would be left vacant. There will be no place for a Kautukam in this class of temple. One important inference we draw is that the installation of a Kautuka Beram is not an essential part of temple worship. The Dhruva Murti could be worshipped directly.1 The use of the terms Brahmyam, Daivikam, Manusham and Paisacham needs some explanation. According to mythology, in the Adi Murti or Brahmam the three gunas Satvam, Rajas and Tamas are equally balanced and the one does not act on the other. When Brahma first commenced his creative activity he produced from the upper portion of his body the Devas who were all of pure Sātvic nature. The Daivika zone denotes this. Next from out of the mid portion of his body he produced human beings whose predominant guna is Rajas. So the next zone in the garbha griham is called Manusham where images of human beings who rose to the rank of immortals would be placed. Brahma the foremost of the jivātmas occupies the same. Then Brahma from the lower portion of his body created Rakshasas. Pisachas, etc., whose predominant guna is Tamas. Rudra whose predominant guna is Tamas is therefore placed in the Paisacha zone, while Brahma whose main guna is Rajas and who is the foremost of the jivatmas occupies the Manusha zone. Bhrigu, Märkandeya, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkumara and the Nava Brahmas crossed the ocean of birth by their bhakti and penance and are placed</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
in the Daivika zone very near to the Dhruva Murti. (The Kautuka, Snapana, Utsava and the Bali berams which are to be seen in the garbha griham will be considered separately).
The Dhruva Murti.
Except that the Dhruva Murti should have the distinctive features of Vishnu there is no restriction placed on the form which the Bimbam should assume, nor the name by which the Murti would be known. In very many of the old temples in the Tamil country which have been sung by the Alvårs the Dhruva Murti is not a representation of any of the well known avatars of Vishnu. Their names have been associated with or borrowed from the name of the village. But they bear those marks which unmistakably show that the Murti is Vishnu. The injunction given in the Agama (Marichi Samhita:20th patalam;page 88) is that for archana purposes the Murti should be distinctly described as having the characteristic features. The colour should be Sveta for a murti of the Krita yuga; Rukma (gold colour) for Trētāyuga; for Dvapara yuga, Rakta colour; for Kali yuga Syama colour. In practice Syama is considered to be the ruling colour for Murtis of all Yugas. Besides the colour the other characteristic features to be mentioned are Vahana, Kētu (dhvaja); Nāma nakshatra, Patni, Bijakshara, Ravah (Sabdam or dhvani). These have to be assigned to every deva. Vishnu is therefore described as being of Syāma varna, Pitambaradhara (Yellow clothes), Kirița, Kēyūra, Hāra, Pralamba Yagnopavita, and as &lsquo;Srivatsanka, Chaturbhajah, Sankha chakradharh, Abhaya Katyavalambita hastah; Garudadhvajavahanah, &lsquo;A&rsquo; (~) kāra Bija, Pancha Sabda Ravō, Dakshina vāmayōh Sri Bhumi Sahito &lsquo;Vishnuh.&rsquo; The other divine weapons and divine ornaments are not mentioned here because they are optional. In some postures and mental conditions even Sankham and Chakram are omitted. The Pralamba Yagnopavitam (the sacred thread), Srivatsam and Katisütram (waist thread) should invariably be seen. Even Sri Devi might be absent.
The Murti should be located on the pitham which as has already been mentioned consists of four planks (Dharmam,
328
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Jñānam, Aiswaryam and Vairagyam) bound together by three glittering bands called Trimekhala running round the four sides and spaced at equal intervals. On the pitham and under the mürti is the eight or sixteen petal Padmam.
The Agamas have designed different postures and different conditions in which the Murti could appear. The attendant dévas for each such state are mentioned in the Agamas. The postures as already mentioned are standing, sitting, reposing or lying in bed and moving or walking. The mental states in which He might appear in each of the above postures are Yoga, Bhōga, Vīra, and Abhichārika. The type of Murti selected for installation would largely depend on the requirements of the locality and the bent of mind of the peop&rsquo;e. If spiritual culture is the pressing need a Yoga mürti would be installed. The superstitious belief is that a Yoga murti in the heart of a town would bring about the extinction of its material prosperity. Therefore the site for such a temple should be on the outskirts of the town. If the desire of the people is to have greater material prosperity in the place and the promotion of fine arts and literature, a Bhōga murti would be installed in the heart of the town. If the promotion of war mentality and military science are the aims, a Vira Murti would be installed in a secluded place just outside the town. But for the effective defence of the country and the safety of the people, dependence is always on Vishnu. Therefore an Abhicharika murti would be installed in forests and on hills along the boundary line between kingdoms; and overlooking the enemy country to keep off enemies.1</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Sanaka, Sanatkumara, Tumburu, Narada, Māya Samhlădini, Vyajini, Kinnara mithunas, Yaksha Vidyadharas form the special assemblage along with Sürya and Chandra in the Uttama state. Tumburu, Nārada, Yaksha Vidyadharas are omitted in the madhyama and in the adhama state would also be omitted Sanaka, Sanat kumara, Surya Chandra and Bhrigu Markendeya.
Vira Sthanakam:-Kishkindha, Sundara, Vyajini, Sanaka, Sanatkumara, Surya and Chandra form the special assembly. Omission of Kishkindha, Sundara, Sanaka and Sanat Kumara makes it madhyama. For the Adhama State Surya and Chandra are also omitted.
Yoga asana:-Special assemblage is made by Sanaka, Sanat Kumara, Surya and Chandra (Uttamam). Their omission makes it madhyamam. Omission of Bhrigu and Markandeya makes it adhama.
Bhoga asanam Special assemblage:-
Māya, Yaksha, Vidyadharas, Sanaka, Sanat Kumara, Surya, Chandra, Tumburu, Narada, Kinnara mithunas. Omission of Kinnara mithunas, Tumburu, Narada, Yaksha Vidhyadharas makes it madhyamam. Omission of also Sanaka, Sanat Kumara, Surya, Chandra and Bhrigu and Markandeya makes it adhama.
Virasanam Special assemblage:-Sanaka, Sanat Kumara, Tumburu Narada, Vyajini. If the above omitted, madhyama. If Brahma, Sankara. Surya Chandra etc., omitted, adhama.
Bhoga Sayanam Special assemblage formed by:-
Vakratunda and Vindhyavasini, Madhu Kaitabha, Garuda, Apsaras, Surya Chandra, Tumburu Narada, Asvinis, Ashta lokapalas (Indra, etc.). If Tumburu Narada, the eight lokapalas and Asvinis are omitted it becomes madhyamam. If Bhrigu, Markandeya and apsaras also omitted, the rest is adhama.
Vira Sayanam Special assemblage:-
Kinnara mithunams, Surya Chandra, Sapta Rishis, Dvādasa adityas, Ekadasa rudras, Jayadisă Apsaras, Tumburu Narada,
332TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Sanaka Sanat Kumara make it Uttama. Omission of the Rudras, Adityas, Apsaras makes it madhyama. If Kinnara mithunas, Sanaka Sanat Kumara and Bhrigu Markandeya are omitted it will be adhama.
Abhicharika State:-In the abhicharika condition (standing, sitting and sayana) excepting Sesha in the Uttama and Madhyama States (and not even he in the Adhama State) there will be no deva attendants. The temple will be without a Vimanam and the murti installed on an inauspicious day and hour. The mürti will have lean and lanky limbs, the countenance, and particularly the eyes will be weird looking. The only marks to characterise the murti as Vishnu will be the Yagnōpavitam, the Kati sutram and the Srivatsam. In the sayana posture of the Uttama state the Murti will be on the Sesha having two hoods; but one hood only in the madhyama State. The murti&rsquo;s look will be that of one who is pronouncing incantations against the enemy.
The Dhruva Murti might therefore assume any physical or mental state. It was also stated that He might occupy the Brahma Sthanam and have no Kautuka Beram with him. But it is not usual to instal a Dhruva Murti of this kind. We are used to seeing in almost all temples a number of portable images which are intended to represent the Dhruva Murti during the daily puja and on special occasions. We have in fact four such portable images called the Kautuka, the Utsava, the Snapana and the Bali Berams. All the four are considered by us to be essential for temple worship. But at one time it was not so considered. In the Shanmurti and the Nava murti alayams the Kautuka Beram only figured along with the Dhruva Murti and the four Vyuha murtis, or in addition to the above Nara Narayana, Nrisimham and Vāraham. There was obviously no provision for a Utsava, Snapana and Bali Berams, We are told that the Vyuha murtis had each its own Shrine and a seperate Kautukam. In this connection it is worth stating what the Bhrigu Samhita says in connection with the installation of Murtis in a new temple (Chapter 12, Bhagavat Pratishtha Vidhih. page 77 and 78). The maximum number of images which could be installed to represent the group-Dhruva Murti and associated Berams-is nine. They are the Dhruva Murti Vishnu, including
333
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Sri Devi and Bhu Devi, Purusha, Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha. All these are presumably stationary images. In addition to these five, are the four portable Idols of Kautuka, Utsava, Snapana and Bali Berams. (The Utsava Beram will have Sri Devi and Bhu Devi images in company). Thus nine images could be installed. But it is not mandatory. The Agama says that it is left to the donor to choose those images only whose daily worship could unfailingly be provided for by him.1
The karta could, if he is unable to provide for the naivedyam of all the bērams, instal only those for whom he could provide unfailingly. Thus he might instal the four Vyuha murtis and the Kautukam alone. Or he might dispense with the Vyuha murtis and instal the Dhruva Murti and the four bērams, viz., Kautukam, Utsavam, Snapanam and Bali, or any one or more of these. That such partial installations were not uncommon could be gathered from what is stated in the Samhitas about finding a portable bēram for the annual festival celebrations. It says that if an Utsava bēram with the two Devis is not available, the Snapana beram could be used. If even that is not available the Bali beram could be used. In the worst case the Kautuka bēram could be used even if it has no Devis by the side. Thus a temple having a Dhruva Murti and a Kautuka Bēram could well celebrate the Brahmotsavam making use of the Kautukam itself. A reading</li>

TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
of the T.T.D. inscriptions I. 8 para 5 and I. 9 para 2. shows that the Kautuka Beram, Bhoga Srinivasa (Maṇavālapperumal) was actually used for the annual festival and was taken out in street processions also on all the nine days morning and night. In those days there was neither a Utsava Bēram nor a Snapana nor Bali bēram in Tirumala.
The above account shows the status and relative importance of the Kautuka, the Utsava, the Snapana and the Bali bērams. But the current practice is to instal all these four idols to serve as proxies of the Dhruva Murti. The Snapana bēram is used for all Snapana Tirumanjanams (ritualistic abhishekams). The Utsava bēram serves for all and the Bali beram should be used for celebrating the nityōtsavam when Bali is distributed to all the parivara devatas in the temple. The Kautukam alone should be the true and exact copy of the Dhruva Murti. He receives the abhishekam and the various acts of the daily archana. The Kautukam alone occupies the Brahmasthanam. The Utsava Bēram would be placed to the left of the Dhurva Murti: the Snapana and the Bali bēram would be on the right side.1
But if there be insufficient space in the garbhagriham the Utsava, Snapana and Balibēram could be accommodated in the mukhamantapam or the antaralam as well.
There is also one other feature in connection with the daily pūja which raises the suspicion that even the Kautuka bēram had some times been occupying a separate shrine within the limits</li>

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
of the third avaranam of the temple. After the daily abhishekam is finished the Kautuka bēram is shifted back to the Brahma sthanam (from the Snapana pitham) and nyasam is done to the devas who occupy the first three ävaranas. The devas in the first two avaranas surrounding the Dhruva murti are the murtis who are presumed to be in the actually existing avaranams in the temple. They are the manifestations of the Adi murtis as Vyūhas and Vyuhantaras occupying the first avaranam and the Vibhava and Vibhaväntaras occupying the second avaranam. The devatas in the third avaranam are the Dikpalas (Indra, etc.). After nyasam is dore to these, there is again nyasam done for a duplicate set of avarana devas surrounding the Kautuka Bēram. Two separate åvaranams are mentally conceived as if in existence. The devas for these two fictitious avaranas are separate from those of the Dhruva Murti&rsquo;s avaranams. Although this conception of a duplicate set of avaranas is now a mere fiction, there is the suspicion that the Kautuka beram would have been accommodated separately, if not permanently yet temporarily for some days (as during festivals when the Kautuka acts the part of Utsava beram). This accommodation would have been inside the third avaranam, but away from the first two avaranams of the Dhruva Murti. A place like this would have been called Tiruvilamkoyil; such as the one in which Bhoga Srinivasa was first consecrated. The two Devis (Sri and Bhu) or Sri Devi only will be with the Dhruva Murti in almost all cases. But in the Yoga and Abhichārika sthitis there will be no Devi with the Dhruva Murti. Even if there should be the Devi, the nyasam for Her will be done only after the nyasam for the devas in the first two avaranams and the nyasam for the Dikdevās are finished. This disregard is understandable to us who regard the Devis as being co-equal with Vishnu and therefore entitled to worship next only to Him. The Devas of the first two avaranams are manifestations of the Adi murti and they face outwards, Bahir mukham. The devas of the third avaranas are beings created by Brahma and belong to the Brahmandam. They face inwards (antar mukham) and the nyasam for them would therefore be inwards.
336
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Parivara devas within the garbhagriham, the Vimanam and the first avaranam.
Alongside of the Dhruva Murti some other devas should be and were installed according to the Agama rules. In the more ancient temples these images could be seen even now. But in recent constructions they are omitted. During the daily puja however they have to be thought of and nyasa flowers in their name deposited between the feet of the Dhruva Murti. These devas are of two classes. Some are presumed to be present at all times and under all conditions. Others are permitted to be present when the Dhruva Murti is in certain Sthitis; such as Yoga, Bhōga and Vira. This has already been tabulated in this chapter.
Dvara devas, dvarapalas, Vimana palas, Vishvaksena, Sri Bhutam and Garuda will always be in their respective places. They are anapayins. Brahma, Sankara Märkandeya and Bhrigu will not be present in certain Sthitis. But during the daily puja they are treated as being present and nyasam is done for them and the flower placed between the feet of the Dhruva Murti. Their names and the place they occupy will now be given.
DVARA DEVAS-Dhata and Vidhata (brothers) stand on either side of the pradhana dvāram within the garbha griham in the spot called Gandharva sthanam. They are the sons of Bhrigu by his wife Khyati. Dhātā is on the south side and Vidhātā on the north side of the entrance facing north and south respectively. The door frame has four devatas in it. On the bottom piece is Bhuvanga lying on his back with his head to the south and facing up. He is of neela colour. On the lower face of the top piece is Patanga lying on his back with his head to the north and facing down. He is of white colour (sukla). The side frames are occupied by Patira and Varuna (south and north side respectively) standing erect facing north and south. They are both of suvarna colour. On the outerside of the dvaram (doorway) are the two dvarapalas Manika and Sandhya. Manika on the south side, of svēta colour; Sandhya on the north side, of kanaka colour.
&ldquo;Manikam mahābalam vimalam dvāra pälakam. Sandhyām Prabhāvatim jyōtīrupām drudhavratām.&rdquo;

337
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The VIMANAM which towers above the Garbhagriham is guarded by four devas (Vimana palas). Nyaksha stands right above the doorway on the east side of the base of the Vimanam facing east. VIVASVAN is on the south side facing south; MITRA on the west facing west and KSHATTA on the north facing north. (When the temple is of the Adhama type there will be only Nyaksha, since there may be no Vimanam to boast of).
MUKHAMANTAPAM DVARAPALAS:The dvarapalas standing on either side of the entrance into the mukhamantapam are Vikhanas on the south and TAPASA on the north side.
&ldquo;Vikhanasam tapayuktam siddhidam sarvadarsinam
Tāpasam siddhirājam sarvadōshavivarjitam.&rdquo;
Vishvaksena:-He is as it were the commander-in-chief of the divine forces or, Vishnu ganas. His place is at the north-east corner of the north side of the first avaranam close to the foot of the Vimanam facing south. He is agni colour, wears yellow (pita) clothes; has all Vishnu&rsquo;s abharanams excepting Srivatsam and Yagnopavita. Has two hands; wears flower garlands; holds sakti danḍam; Jayapati; Srunga kētu.
(Sri Bhuta, Garuda, Chakra, Sankha, Dhvaja, Yudhadhipa and Pavakorjuna are the other indispensable parivara devatās called anapayins. As their place is outside the Garbhagriham, they will be described later).
BRAHMA, SANKARA, MARKANDEYA
AND BHRIGU.
The images of these devas will be found very near to the Dhruva Murti in almost all cases. The sthitis in which &ldquo;Brahma, Sankara and Märkandeya, Bhrigu &quot; will be omitted have already been</li>

mentioned. They are however the most important parivära devas in the Garbhagriham.
Markandeya is of Suvarna colour, a brahmachari (bachelor), wears rakta colour clothes, rides padma vähanam. Kürcham is his dhvajam, his sound is that of Sankam, &lsquo;ma&rsquo; bījam. &ldquo;Märkandeyam Punyam Puranam amitam.&rdquo;
Bhrigu:-agni colour; white (Sukla) clothes; padma vähanam; Kamandalu dhvajam; Rohinisam; Sankha ravō, &lsquo;Bhri&rsquo; bijam, &lsquo;Khyati&rsquo; isa; &lsquo;Padmā&rsquo; pită.
&ldquo;Padmapitaram Dhātrinātham, Khyātīsam&rdquo;
Brahma-His place in the garbhagriham is close to the south wall facing the north; is of gold colour; has four hands; hamsa vähanam; holds Kamandalu in hand; born in Abhijit; husband of Săvitri; ma&rsquo; bija; the sound of the Vedas. &ldquo;Brahmanam Prajapatim, Pitāmaham Hiranyagarbham.&rdquo;
Sankara-His place is close to to the north wall; white colour (Sveta); wears Vyaghra charma (tiger skin) clothes; has parasu mriga in hand (four hands); Vrishabham (Bull is his vahanam and dhvajam; his sound is that of damarukam &lsquo;; &rsquo; ma&rsquo; bijam; born in Ardra; Umapati, bears Ganga on his head.&rdquo; Vrishabha Vāhanam. Ashta mûrtim, Umapatim.&rdquo;
The status accorded to Brahma and Sankara in the pantheon calls for some remarks. The Agamas describe in one place the Trimurti and the Dvimurti temples where each has His own Shrine with separate antarmandalam round the Shrine. The temple and the pråkarams are the same for all. Any one might occupy the central place and any one of the other two might be to the right or left side. This is tantamount to treating them as Devas of equal status. That such was the case is borne out by the description given by Sri Nammalvar in his account of the temple in Tiruchchengunrür (chirṛārṛankarai) in the Malai nada country bordering on Tiruvankur. The Alvar speaks highly of the admirable way in which three thousand Brahmins well versed in the Vedas and
339
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Vedangas were worshipping the Trimurtis. The Alvar describes at the same time the subordinate status given to Rudra in the temple in his birth place and in other places. The Mudal ālvärs who flourished about two centuries earlier speak of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra being only different manifestations of the same Nārāyaṇa. Pēyālvar in particular stated that in Tirumala, the Mürti was decorated to look like Vishnu at one time and like Siva at another. He said that both the forms aptly fit the Murti We however find that ultimately the Agamas have placed Brahma and Rudra as Devas in attendance on Vishnu in the garbhagriham. In the nyasam stage of the Nityarchana, Märkandeya and Bhrigu are given preference. Then comes the turn of Brahma and Rudra. The nyasam is offered Abhimukham because they face the Dhruva Murti just like the other mortals Indra, Varuna etc., The nyasam for the Devas who are considered to be the manifestations of the Adi Murti are offered &quot; Bahir mukha,&rdquo; as if facing the created universe and its beings.

The lay worshipper could not by any means notice this differential status since the installation of the images of Brahma and Rudra has long been abandoned, evidently owing to the influence of the acharyas. In temples where these images still stand as relics of the old order, the Sthalapuranams ascribe some reason or other for their retention.
The Vimanam and its Images.
The images found on the Vimanam are not objects of daily worship. But they deserve attention because they are connected with the Vimanam which is a sacred structure. The Agamas specify the kind of image which could find a place therein. The other reason is that there are lay people who, if they only sec on the Vimanam of a Vishnu Shrine any image, whether of a Deva Saivite pantheon, at
or a beast, in any way connected with the
once jump to the conclusion that the temple was at one time a

TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Saivite place of worship. We have known this kind of argument in connection with the Tirumala Temple. The Vimanam also bears testimony to the fact that the Vyuha, Vyühantara, the Vibhava and the Vibhavantara forms were at one time being installed within the first and the second avaranams of the temple. Although this practice was abandoned, their representation on the Vimanam structure continues.
There are several types of Vimanams, three of which the Santika, the Paushtika and the Jayada were already mentioned. Enumeration of the several types would interest only those who study the architectural side of the temple, and will therefore be omitted here. The more common type has a square base and is in height about 1 to 2 times the side of the base. It may consist of two, three or more tiers. Images made in stucco are usually set up on the four faces in each tier and at the angular points. The neck portion between one tier and the next one above are also adorned with images. These will now be mentioned.
On the base, or, first tier (Mulatalam) Vishnu murti (of the type in the garbhagriham) would be placed on the east side. On the roof of the Mukhamantapam and in front of the Mülatalam would be images of Tapasam and Siddhidam; on the south face of the Mulatalam there would be Satya; on the west face Achyuta and on the north Aniruddha. Vinayaka and Vindhya Vasini (Durga) would be on the north and the south side of the roof of the mukha-
mantapam.
Second Tier. Purusha on the east side to the south of the centre and chakram would be to the north of the centre. On the south side Nrisimha; on the west Achyuta and on the north Varaham.
In the neck or galam between the two tiers there would be Purusha, Dakshinamurti, Pitamaha (or Brahma), Nrisimha, and Varaham, all at the angular points.
At all corners Garuda or Simham should be placed. Plenty of Nrisimhas on the south and the west sides ensure destruction of enemies and success to the King.
341
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
A slightly different arrangement in the galam (neck) is given in Bhrigu Samhita. Purusha in the south; Narasimham in the west; and in the north Hayagrivam.
Images of the Saivite pantheon are also used along with those of the Vishnu pantheon-Indra, Kumaraswami, Umapati, Dakshinamurti, Nrisimha, Sridhara, Brahmanam, Dhanadipa, Adi Varaha, Narahari, Hayagriva, Nara Narayana, the four kinds of Krishna, Purusha, Satya, Achyuta, Ananta and Vasudeva might appear on sides, Ananta and Aniruddha might appear more than once on the north sides just as Nrisimha does on the south and west sides. A true representation of the Dhruva Murti might be placed on the top on the north side.
Anapayi Parivara devatas.
It was already mentioned that these are Sri Bhutam, Garuda, Nyaksha, Vishvaksena, Chakram, Dhvajam, Sankham, Yūdhādhipa, (Akshahanta or) Pāvakarjuna. The place for Nyaksha and Vishvaksena was already described. It is curious that Ananta or Sesha is not mentioned as one of the Anapayins.
Sri Bhutam-is brahmachari (bachelor). His weapon is a danḍa (stick); vahanam and dhvajam Simham; He is of white colour, wears rakta colour clothes; faces outwards (bahirmukha); born in Bharani nakshatra of Phalguna month. His place is in the middle of the Sopanam (stepping stone) of the mukhamantapam doorway or in the third part of the first avaranam front space.
&ldquo;Sri Bhutam Svetavarnam Vaishnavam Mukhapalinam&rdquo;
Garuda-bright in colour; Sukapinchambara clothing; wears all abharanas; wears Kirītam; has serpents of five colours on his body; two hands folded in anjali posture; Vayu vāhanam; his place is usually in the second avaranam; but in a small temple having only one avaranam his place will be in the third quarter space of that avaranam. In fact Chakram, Dhvajam, Sankham, Mahabhutam and akshahantam would all be placed in this quarter
342TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
in successive order. If there are three avaranams Garuda will be located in the second quarter of the second avaranam.
Chakram, Dhvajam, Sankham, etc.
Chakram will be in the third quarter of the second avaranam. Sankham will be in the second quarter of the third avaranam;
Dhavajam will be in the third quarter of the third avaranam.
Yudhadhipa will be in the third quarter of the fourth avaranam.
Akshabanta in the third quarter of the fifth avaranam, or outside of the Gopuram and in front of, but just outside, the centre line. If as stated before all are placed in the first avaranam itself, Garuda will be in the second quarter from the foot of the Vimanam; Balipitham will be in the third quarter. If there be only one ăvaranam, the temple will be classed as adhamādhama (lowest). such a temple would have only Vishvaksena, Garuda, Sri bhūtam, Nyaksha and Bhutapitham. There will not be Dhvaja, Chakra, Sankha, and akshahanta in an adhamadhama temple.

CHAPTER XII (Contd.)
SECTION V.
THE DEVAS IN THE SEVEN AVARANAS.
Prathamavarana devas.
THE devas at the four cardinal points (E. S. W. &amp; N) are the
well known Vyuha avataras, Purusha Satya, Achyuta and Aniruddha. Those at the four intermediate angular points commencing with S.E. are Kapila, Yagna, Nārāyana and Punya. These four seem to be from out of the Vyuhäntaras. But as was already pointed out more than once not one of these is represented as an image in that avaranam. Their names are recited mentally and the archaka during the nyasa is presumed to draw a picture with all particulars of each deva at the time. (These particulars will be given separately in a note).
Dvitiya avarana devas (Second enclosure).
As in the case of the first avarana devas, here also two sets of devas both of the Vibhava avatars and the Sub Vibhavas are selected. Those at the cardinal points from E to N. are Varaham, Narasimham, Vāmanam and Trivikramam; at the angular points S.E. to N.E. are Subhadram, Isitātman, Sarvodvaham, Sarvavidyesvaram. It will be noted that the four principal Vibhavas selected are those who were supernatural and not having human birth and human characteristics.
Similarly two sets of avarana devas have been coined for the Kautuka murti as already pointed out. They are from east to north-east going clockwise.

All the above devas face outwards or are Bahirmukham. Archana is done on this presumption only.
In the second avaranam apart from the Vibhava devas mentioned above there are also the nine planets or Nava Grahas, which face inwards or the garbhagriham; therefore antarmukha. The devas who belong to the Vyuha or Vibhava manifestations of the Adimurti belong to the Vaishnavandam. But the navagrahas belong to our material universe. Therefore the navagrahas are made to face the Supernatural world. It is therefore in this second avaranam of the Dhruva murti that the supermundane and the mundane beings meet and face each other.
THE NAVAGRAHAS (Second avaranam).
Aditya (Sun, Ravi)-is placed on the north side of the mukhadvåram of the second avaranam and Chandra-is placed on the South side of the same. They face the west.
The position of Angāraka, Budha, Brihaspati, Sukra, Sani, Rāhu and Kētu, and the direction which each faces are shown on the enclosed chart. They are all of semidivine origin and perhaps for that reason find a place in the second avaranam in preference to Indra and the other Dik devas who are in the third
346
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
avaranam. Of the ashṭamurti forms of Rudra-Rudra&rsquo;s place is in Ravi and Ravi&rsquo;s son is Sani. Another form of Rudra is Bhavam residing in water whose son is Sukra; Angaraka is the son of sarvam who resides in Bhumi. Isana another of the Rudra murti forms resides in Agni; Mahādēvam resides in Chandra whose son is Budha. They are all closely and directly connected with Brahma the creator.
The Third avarana devas.
They are the Lōkapālas-Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirruti, Varuna, Vayu, Kubēra and Isana counting from east to north east clockwise. All these devas are antarmukha or facing the sanctum. They represent the first Satvic creation which came out of the upper portion of Brahma&rsquo;s body. They declined to line on earth and are therefore in the airy regions. The third avaranam affords accommodation for some more devatas along side of its outer portion (perhaps close to the walls) and also for some in the antarālam or open space between the second and the third avaranam walls.
Along side of the walls are-Durga on the north side of the mukhadvāram and Ganga on the south side, both facing west. Sarasvati is at S.E. and Dhatri (Mahā Kāli) at N.E. Yamuna, Sindhu, Narmada. Sree, and Jyeshta are the others. The chart showing the first three avaranams gives the particulars about where they are and which direction they face. In the antaralam are Sura, Sundari, Svaha, Svadha, Samhladini, Raka and Sinivali. Most of these female deities are the daughters of one or the other of the Nava Brahmas. The chart gives particulars of place and the direction they face.
The Lōka pālas, the river devis and the other female deities in the antaralam of the third avaranam figure frequently in the rituals of the temple as well as in the rituals in our home. They form the connecting link between the Devesa and the beings in the Brahmandam. Agni is the medium through whom all fire offerings are made to whichever Devata the offering may be intended. These ritualistic functions are conducted in accordance with the injunctions given in the Rigveda hymns.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Fourth avaranam.
The fourth avaranam of the temple conformably represents the four Vedas, their respective Chandas, the kind of homam peculiar to cach and so on. The devatas associated therewith are also placed in that avaranam. As agni and angaraka are at the S. E. corners in the previous avaranas Rig Vedam is placed in that corner of the fourth avaranam. Atharva Vedam is placed in the N.E. corner in which direction will be found all those deities which are connected with Isana. Durga and Mahakali are in that corner in the third avaranam. Vishnu on the right and Siva on the left side will be found in the antaralam of this avaranam. The devas are Harini, Agni, Toyam, Vayu, and Gavishta. In the antaralam are Vishnu, Kasyapa, Guha, Panktisa, Pavitra, Pavana, Takshaka, and Siva. Rig Vedam, Yajur Vedam, Sama Vedam and Atharva Vedam are at the corners.
Fifth avarana devas.
Along the outer side in the avaranam are Anumati, Vatsara, Saptamataras, Panchapranas, Jayadayas, Maruts, Sapta rohinis, Sata rudras and Kuhu (Anumati and Kuhu are two out of the four daughters of Angiras, the other two being Raka and Sinīvāli who are in the north wing of the third avaranam).
Those in the antaralam are Ekadasa rudras, Dvadasa Adityas, Gandharvas, Munis, Apsaras, Asvinis, Vasavas and Vidyadaras.
Some of the collective designations given will be explained in a note.
The sixth avarana Devas.
Narada and Tumburu lead standing on the right and the left side. The others are Hatesa, Ritava, Jambava, Prajapati, Mudgala and Asura. In the antaralam are Prahlada and Kinnara mithunas to the right and the left on the east side. Then Madana, Vipa, Vyajini, Kamini, Chandrabha and Sundara.

Mahat Pitham.
Outside the prakaram walls and in front of the mukhadvaram will be the Mahat Pitham whereon the Bali offerings for all unnamed spirits including those of the under world are offered. &ldquo;Sarvan devän samarchayet.&rdquo;
Ganas.
The devas who face inwards and who are in ävaranas two, three and four have a definite status. Those who are in the avaranas five to seven are of a mixed composition. They are collectively known as Ganas (parijanam or congregation of Spirits). By temperament and innate nature some are considered good, some middling and some bad. They are therefore divided into three classes-Uttama ganas, Madhyama ganas and Adhama ganas. The division is as follows:-
Uttama ganas:-Adityas, Vasudevas, Rudras, Sadhyas, Maruts, Visvēdēvas, Pitris, Mātris, Grihadēvatas, Angiras, Asvini devas, Stree devas, Lōkēsās, Västudēvas, Nakshatras, Pärshadas, Tatva patis.
Madhyama ganas:-Siddhas, Rishis, Nāgas, Asuras, Rakshasas, Yakshas, Vidyadharas, Saurabhēyas, Guhyakas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Prajapatis Martyas and Rohinis.
Adhama ganas:Bhūtas, Prētas, Pisachas, Kushmandas, Pramathas, Skandas, Balagrahas, Taitalas, Bhairavas, Kinnaras, Vētālas, Apasmāras, Yoginis, Dakinis, Sakinis, Chankas, Mōhinis, Jāghanis.
Hindus believe that all these spirits play their part in the universe as much as we do and that therefore they should not be ignored.

CHAPTER XII (Contd.)
SECTION VI.
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
Main Purpose of Temple Worship
Universal Co-operation.
THE Agama rituals are based on the recognition of the principle that all forms of life should be made to co-operate with each other. Co-operation facilitates not only material advancement but also spiritual evolution. The active co-operation and help of the more advanced beings are sought and ensured and the impediments likely to be placed by the backward and mischievous spirits are removed or weakened by extending good-will to them as well. It is only by ensuring peace, plenty, happiness and contentment all around us that the environment necessary for the practice o yoga and meditation leading to god-realisation could be created and kept up. Therefore daily puja is performed and bali offered to the various deities so that the general prosperity of the world with a stable and just governance is maintained. The object in performing puja six times a day is explained thus-Prathabkala puja (early morning) is for ensuring the unfailing performance of japas and homas by those whose duty lies that way. Madhyana puja is to ensure a flourishing administration or Rajarashtra abhivriddhi. The evening puja is for ensuring abundance of food grains and pulses (Sarva sasya abhivriddhi). The dawn puja (Ushakala puja) is for increase of population and cattle wealth (Prajā pasu abhivriddhi); the aparahna (after-noon) puja is for the destruction of daityas (the evil doers) and the ardharatra puja is for increase of all quadrupeds. Thus the daily puja is not only a prayer for being given our daily bread but also for all round happiness and contentment. The spirits to whom bali food is offered are not being thereby worshipped and propitiated. The food offering is made because we have to share our prosperity
351HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
with all living things. These devatas face the garbha griham in the same manner that we do. The Bali homam is done and the . food so consecrated is distributed to all the devatas under the superintendence of the Bali Beram. This is universal charity which must be practiced in self interest at least. We and the spirits are interdependent and co-operative effort is necessary for the fulfilment of the purpose of creation as we understand it.
Annual Festivals or Kalotsavam.
The purposes for which the recurring annual festival is celebrated are for world-wide peace, all round plenty and prosperity, for successful administration of the country, for the destruction of all its enemies and for freedom from fear of famine and pestilence. This kind of festival is considered imperative and should be timed every year in the month in which the first consecration took place so that the 9th. day day (forenoon) is concurrent with the installation nakshatram. Flag hoisting should invariably be done. The period might be 21 days, 14 days, or 9 days. Such long period festivals might also be celebrated when foreign invasion, pestilence or the appearance of comets forebode evil to the country. Private individuals might also celebrate in fulfilment of vows taken.
The main point which deserves our attention is the manner of celebration. The festival is for the benefit of all living things in the universe. All beings irrespective of their spiritual attainments and relative importance are invited to attend the grand festival or Yagna for Sri Vishnu. They are invited and installed each</li>

in its appropriated place. Food, water and flowers are provided for all. This function of extending universal invitation is a grand idea and bears testimony to the spirit in which the Agamas work temple worship. The grand procession at its commencement with full temple paraphernalia and the representative murti in Tiruchchi vehicle starts from the garbha griham, goes round the temple prākarams, then through the streets surrounding the prākārams and thence to all streets, lanes, nooks and corners. All the devas are named and invited; then the collective or group spirits are likewise called to take part in the festival or Yagna and make it a success. They are assured of lodging and food at least twice a day. The proclamation should be made in a stentorian voice at all well recognised points in the village or town.1 Slokas 153 to 165 of chapter 24 p. 215, 216 (Bhrigu Samhita) give a clear description of all the devas and ganas who are invited and shown their place in the temple. All the ganas and devas are also shown in the two charts annexed to this chapter showing the seven ǎvaranams.

All temples are not constructed with seven avaranams. Most temples have only one to three avaranams. A few might be having

more. The Agamas therefore divide temples into three main divisions and again provide three sub-divisions in each. These divisions are intended to specify less number of parivara devatas and anapayinis and therefore fewer archakas, paricharakas and less provision for food offerings. The main divisions are Adhama, Madhyama and Uttama. Again the sub-divisons are one avaranam Adhamadhama; two avaranams Adhama madhyama; three avaranams Adhamottama and Madhyama adhama; four avaranams Madhyama madhyama; five avaranams Madhyamottama and Uttama adhama; six avaranams Uttama madhyama and seven avaranams Uttamottama. The number of parivära devas, the number of archakas, paricharakas and the quantity for food offering are tabulated hereunder (the parivara devas are in addition to those in the garbhagriham and the anapayins which are essential for all temples).

TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
The essential devas common to all temples are:-The Dhruva Murti and the Devi or Devis; Brahmā, Sankara, Mārkandēya, Bhrigu, Dhātā, Vidhata, Bhuvanga, Patanga; Patera, Varuna, Manikam and Sandhya, Vikhanas and Tapasa; Kishkindam and Tirtham).
The names of the additional parivara devatas shown in column two of the above statement will now be given only up to Madhyama uttama classes and not for the Uttama series.
Adhamādhama temple-Vishvaksena, Garuda, Sribhūtam, Nyaksha and Bhuta pitham (5).
Adhama madhyama-(eleven more than above) Indra and the other seven lõka pālas, Bhaskara, Sankha and Chakram. (Total 16).
Adhama uttama-(five more) Vivasvăn, Mitra, Kshatta, Dhvaja, Yudhadhipa. (Total 21)
Madhyama adhama-(eleven more) Siddhi, Sree, Havihalaka, Skanda, Vighnēsa, Sapta matarah, Purusha, Jyeshtha, Bhargava, Brahma, Chandra (Total 32).
Madhyama madhyama-(ten more) Bhaskara, Angāraka, Skanda, Durga, Saptarohinyah, Manda, Saptamātarah, Budha, Brihaspati, Purusha. (Total 42).
Madhyama uttama-Jyeshtha, Sukra, Ganga, Saptarishis, Brahma, Chandra, Rudra, Asvini, Kapila, Panchabhūtas, Sarasvati etc. The same name is found repeated. It is therefore not useful to attempt giving a correct list. We may as well as read from the chart what parivaradevas are in successive avaranams.
The Tirumala temple has three avaranams only. The temples in Tirupati have only two avaranams. A permanent Dhvaja is not essential. The Agama does not consider Sesha to be necessary for any class of temple unless the Dhruva Murti is in the Sayana posture. The table given above showing the classification of temples will however show that a very large number of parivara
355
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
devatas are intended to be set up as images and that they play their part in the daily worship of an Uttama temple having five
to seven avaranams.
The Agamas place before us a form of temple worship which postulates that an atmosphere of Godliness and spirituality could best be created and sustained only under conditions of peace, plenty and contentment in the land. It invites the co-operation of all men, even those of differing creed. We could sense this spirit of catholicity in the use of the different kinds of Samit (twigs of certain sacred trees and plants put into the homam fire) used in the daily homam during the festival days. On the first day päläsam and the second day Bilvam, third day Samīlam, fourth day nygrodham, Udumbaram, sixth day asvattam, seventh day Khadiram, eighth day plaksham, ninth day palasam, but pālasam and asvattham are considered the best and therefore could be substituted for any of the others when unavailable.
But temple worship is however no substitute for personal worship in every home. Temple worship serves to keep our environments in an atmosphere of spirituality most congenial to the practice of personal worship, meditation and dhyānam. This is why our ancients have enjoined us not to live in a place where there is no temple. The form of personal worship is however different from that of temple worship in some particulars. In personal worship the pantheon contains only the Vishnu murti. There is no place for any of the satellite deities excepting Ananta, Garuda and Vishvaksena. The ganas are all of the Vishnu class. The worship is directly to Sriman Narayana. This is the form which is given in Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Nityam. Temple worship and Personal worship are therefore supplementary to each other The acharyas do not at the same time underestimate the part played by the subordinate deities in spiritual evolution. Many do upasana of one or the other of these for the bestowal of material benefits or such spiritual powers as the particular dēvata has in its power.
The lower deities more readily bestow their gifts. &ldquo;Kānkshantah karmanām siddhim Yojanta iha devatah. Kshipram hi
356
TEMPLES AND THE AGAMAS
manushe lõke siddhirbhavati karmajā&rdquo; (Gita 4-12). Even the bestowal of such transcient gifts is due to their devotion to the Supreme Deity.
&ldquo;Labhate cha tatah kämän
Mayaiva vihitan hi tan.&rdquo;
It is also the accepted belief that even such worship or Upāsana gradually leads the upasaka to climb higher and higher in the ladder of spiritual evolution till the final goal is reached. Thus with uninterrupted and continuous bhakti of Surya during seven consecutive births, a mortal as a reward therefor becomes a Rudra bhakta. This continued during seven consecutive births results in his becoming a Vishnu bhakta. Continuous bhakti of Vasudeva (Vishnu) during seven more consecutive births brings as reward his becoming one with Vasudeva (Laya) or Sayujyam.1
The Agamas therefore place before the world a form of worship which gives full scope for all human beings struggling for attainment of spiritual development even while fulfilling the duties of a house holder in this material world. The establishment of material prosperity is a prerequisite for all attempts at renunciation which consists in giving up the enjoyment of the fruits of one&rsquo;s actions. Phalatyagam, not Karmatyagam. This concern of the Agamas is well displayed in the order which they prescribe for the celebration of the annual festival or Kalotsavam (or Brahmotsavam) of Vishnu. The festival for Mahā Kāli should first be celebrated to grant us immunity from everything which result in sorrows. Next should be celebrated the festival of Sankara (Rudra) for the appeasement</li>

of Krüra and Sishta ganas. Then a separate festival in honour of Sri Durga Devi for the appeasement of Visastri gaṇas and for proper functioning of everything. In this festival Sri Vishnu&rsquo;s chakram and Vishvaksēna should escort Sri Durgā Dēvi. As the last item comes the Brahmotsavam of Vishnu (Devesa) for peace to all Devas, all munis, all pirtis and their ladies, all Dvijas and for peace and prosperity to all the lokas. If anything is done contrary to this arrangement great calamity (vinasam) would certainly take place. Therefore the festival commences first with the grămadēvata. The idea is that all obstacles should first be removed so that the resulting conditions might prove favourable for spiritual advancement and the practice of personal worship and Yoga. Thus the co-operation of all created beings good and evil is sought and obtained. This appears to be the path pursued by the Agama form of Temple worship.

CHAPTER XIII.
RETROSPECT.
AT this stage it is desirable to review the changes which have been taking place in the character of worship in Tirumala from time to time.
From the chronologist&rsquo;s or the historian&rsquo;s point of view no date can be assigned for the first appearance of the Dhruva Murti of Tiruvengaḍamudaiyan. The image takes its name from the hill Vengadam which by itself was always-i.e., as far back as tradition can take us considered as sacred as the God thereon and therefore formed an object of worship. Like Badri, Brindavan, Gaya or Ahobilam the place itself was sacred and an object of pilgrimage. So did the Vaishnavite alwars praise Tiruvengadam in their songs. Many who could not find it possible to ascend the thickly wooded hill worshipped the hill and its God at its foot alone and discharged their vows. Great men were doing it and the fact is recorded in an inscription on the north wall of the Mukkoti Pradakshinam.1 This was presumably the practice till the end of the Pallava rule. Some Brahmins of the mid-country called Tondaimandalam who had seen the Chola and the Pandya Desas entertained new ideas. There was to all purposes a self-incarnate image on the Hill, the very idol for an Archa form of worship but without a temple or perhaps sheltered in a small stone mantapa or pavilion, illuminated by the blazing sun or the moon by night. In imitation of the southern Tamils a small stone temple of the Pallava style of architecture was put up consisting of a chamber for the sanctum sanctorum (or Köyilälvär) and an antechamber for the worshippers to stand. One or two ghee or oil lights (Nanda Vilakku) were arranged for

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
by the devotees. There must have been some sort of food offering which after the puja went to feed the pujari and the few other temple servants.
Original Simplicity.
There obviously was not a rigidly ritualistic form of daily worship before we reach the year 966 A.D. The old annual festival in Purattasi month took since then a more rigid shape according to the Vaikhanasa Agama. Four other rituals connected with the sun&rsquo;s motion in the heavens and the Mukkoti Dvadasi formed the principal, rather, the only festive occasions. If a devotee so desired he could celebrate an additional Brahmotsavam technically called Sraddhotsavam and in Tamil Tirukkoḍittirunal (
). The temple structure was designed and constructed to satisfy these elementary needs. The consecration of a small silver image in 966 A.D. brought along with it another hall called Tiruvilankoyil with probably a small pavilion in front to screen it from the north-east monsoon rains.
Neither Sri Alavandar, nor his successors, Tirumala Nambi, Sri Ramanuja or Anantālvär made any attempt to tamper with or alter the Vaikhanasa form of worship. The only addition made seems to have been the building of Gopurams and compound walls (prākārams). The food that was offered to the God was simple in quality and limited in quantity, so much so that special instructions were issued that those who were connected with the temple services should feel content with partaking of such food as was offered to the Deity. They were also enjoined to lead a celebate life while on Tirumala and to go to Tirupati to have a relaxation in family life I. 124 (fragmentary).
There was nothing grandiose in the daily services and in the festivals. But there has been from ancient times the faith that the

          <td>God of Vengadam Hill grants all human desires, material and spiritual, leading by stages to the grant of the boon of God-realisation. The Alwars have sung this unequivocally. When a Sāmavai installed a silver image of Him or a Parantaka Devi-amman (both in widowhood, for aught we know) presented a gold pattam we may be certain that the act was for spiritual welfare. When Ghaṭṭideva, one of the Yadavarayas built the temple under the spiritual inspiration of Sri Ramanuja it must have been likewise. When Ghattideva&rsquo;s descendants, Virarakshasa, Tiruvenkatanatha and Sriranganatha granted villages for the maintenance of temple worship in due form, it was because there was the family prestige and the innate feeling that their success in life depended on their faith in Tiruvengadamudaiyan. If Sundra Pandya placed a gold gilt Kalasam (in 1260 A.D.) on the Vimanam or when his queen arranged for the perpetual supply of milk and curds to supplement the daily food offerings, it must have been a thanksgiving service to Tiruvengaḍamuḍaiyan, as much as when at a later date Mangideva Maharaja gilded the Vimanam and Kalasam in 1359 A.D.1 Such services and grants were of a simple nature. Besides the Yadavarayas including Vira Narasinga, there was also Vijaya Ganḍagōpala of the Telugu Pallava lineage who looked to Tiruvengadam for material success in life. In pursuit of this several acts of simple charity were done, such as feeding the limited number of pilgrims resorting to the shrine.</td>

before the end of the fourteenth century. It was no longer worship of the strictly puritan type. but worship combined with profit and pleasure, and therefore ever more popular.
Bhakti form of worship.
It may not be out of place here to dilate a little on how this Bhakti form of worship would have exhibited itself in temple worship. The Bhakta clothes himself with the garment which has adorned his favourite Deity, he eats the food which has been offered to Him and he adorns himself with the sandal paste and the flowers which adorned Him. Thus equipped, in ecstasy he sings His praise and dances. So it became desirable, and even necessary, that the best things of this world should first be offered to the Deity and then shared together by. His devotees. The sacred texts in Sanskrit and in the vernacular were repeated before Him in devotion. Thus probably came into existence in the early days the gōshtis of brahmins repeating the Vedas and the Tamil Tiruvaymoli Praband hams voluntarily and with no expectation of reward or remuneration. So also the Emperumānadiyārs (vestal virgins) danced and sung and offered Kumbhahārathis at the close of the street processions. So also Bhajana parties and the Nadasvara parties.
But in a place like Tirumala or Tirupati where the temple worship was of the Vaikhanasa school the response must have been poor. So from the beginning artificial aid had to be given in the shape of emoluments. Adhyapakam, Vedapārāyanam, Emperumanadiyars or Tiruvidhisani girls had all to be remunerated. In spite of these inducements the festivals and other functions were not considered sufficiently grandiose. So one Kaṇdādai Ramanuja Ayyangar who had visited all the 108 sacred Temples for Sri Vaishnavas set about a through overhauling from about the year 1468 A.D. For over half-a-century from then this gentleman&rsquo;s attempts were to introduce new festivals due attention being paid to every details of every function. He was largely responsible for getting Saluva Narasimha Deva to help carry out his ideas and recommendations. In spite of over five centuries of this grafting
363
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
The Vijayanagar Period.
We must pass on to the period when the Vijayanagar kings played the most prominent part in enhancing the fame of this temple.
How they happen to come into the picture must first be understood. It is known that the Hoysala-Vira Ballala III marshalled his forces to wipe out the Sultanate of Madura. But he is said to have been captured in an ambush and put to death near Trichinopoly. There was however, Singayya Dannayaka, his military commander who left Tirupati about 1336 A.D. handing over his Arisanalayam Nandavanam and the trust properties attached thereto to one of the Jiyars in Tirumala presumably to enable him to be by the side of his master, the Hoysala King. There was also Sri Vira Kumara Kempana Uḍaiyar, the son of Bukkaraya I, conducting the campaign and Saluva Mangi-Deva ably assisting the former as one of the generals. The campaign was successful and the Sultanate of Madura was annihilated.
Looking at these happenings from the point of view of our temple we have to note that upto this date the great patrons and devotees of the temple came exclusively from the Tamil country, with a few exceptions from the extreme south of the west coasto Not a single inscription do we come across to show that people of the Kannada and Telugu country ever came on pilgrimage to Tirumala. The first to do so was Singayya Dannayaka who came more or less on a military mission, but took that opportunity to do service to the temple by establishing two mathams and Nandavanams each of which he had to hand over to a Tamilian Sanyasi or Jiyar for due performance of the trust charities. Even the inscription relating to this is in Tamil script.
We also find that Bukka I made an endowment of lands for one Tirupponakam food offering (or two) every day (known ever since as the Bukkarayan Sandhi) and for a Brahmotsavam. This may have been in 1365 A.D. to commemorate the capture of the Mudgal fortress by him. To assign a village he must by then have come in possession of the country&hellip; Soon after the conclusion of the campaign Mahamandalësvara Misaraganda Mangi. Deva

Maharaja did the great service of gold gilding the Vimanam and the Sikharam of Tirumaladeva. The inscription is in Telugu as well as in Tamil (I. 179, 180, 6-7-1359 A.D.) which may be taken to connote the transition period. The citation is not the usual regnal year of the local Yadavarayas or the Pandyas but the Sāka year and the name Vikari of the Jupiter Cycle. The last time (1. 7) we noticed mention of the Saka year was in Saka 824 (1002 A. D.) when the Pallava rule had broken down and the Chola supremacy was in the course of being established in this part of the country. On the present occasion the Pandyas and the Yadavarayas had both broken down, the Vijayanagar rule had not established itself thoroughly and Mangi Deva himself was not a ruling prince. So the citation of the Saka year seems to have been once more brought into use and was to continue uninterrupted thereafter. There are also other administrative changes in the temple machinery which have to be considered by us. That a distinctive political change had come over the country is evidenced by the citation of Saka year. This is borne out by another inscription where also the name Vikari and the Saka 1281 (1359) are mentioned in Tamil, the donor being Kariyamanikka Pillai of Paramesvaramangalam (I. 110). Next the Perkaḍai (minister) of Sri Vira Kumara Kempana Udaiyar offered 32 cows and a breeding bull (probably a thanks-giving offering for his military success) for burning one nandavilakku. These are indicative of the fact that besides the Tamils, the Telugus and the Kannada speaking people also had begun to look to Tirumala Deva for granting boons. In the wake of these endowments, we find Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar appearing on the stage as the agent of Harihararaya for instituting a new festival (tirunal) called Masi Tirunal (in that month) in 1387 and 1390 A.D. The cyclic year alone is mentioned in these inscriptions and not even the Saka year (I. 185; 196, Prabhava and Pramoduta).
Another feature to be noticed is that although endowments and gifts are made it is not clearly stated who is the trustee to accept these and to hold himself responsible. We have also to note that Harihararaya&rsquo;s name is given in the singular as good. From all previous inscriptions it is plain that there was a body of
367
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
temple managers which looked to the due performance of all functions. But that body does not figure formally in these SilaSasanams (inscriptions on stone) as taking over the trust gifts from the donors and binding itself to discharge the trust according to the wishes of the donor. The Tiruninra-ür-uḍaiyar (the accoun tants) recorded these two gifts, not the Sthanattär. The temple authorities do not seem to have realised in 1390 that Harihararayar had become the ruler of this part of the country. If they had done so Harihararaya&rsquo;s name should have had some prasasti prefixed to it and the name itself would have been recorded in the respectable plural form.
J
THE ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY.
The first administrative machinery constituted by Samavai was called the Managers of Tiruvengadam temple ($ LOTLUS Quan.). &ldquo;those who do the Mathapatyam,&rdquo; something very vague. Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s arrangement is said to have been a committee consisting of the Archakar, Tirumalai Nambi and Anandālvān. But that is only a traditional statement. During the period of Chola rule it was the manager of the temple (LDLU Q) who held himself responsible for the performance of the trust, but the officers of the King held the whip in their hands. The endowment made by the Periya Nättar (senior men of the villages) of some of the villages as per the oral orders of the King Raja Raja Dever (1. 40. 1234 A.D.) was issued only as an edict of Bhupatideva Chitramela (for the amudupadi and Sättuppaḍi of Tirumangai Alwar). It might however, be believed that the Sthanattar (Sthanikas) were in existence from very early days. At any rate their existence is clearly recognised by Tirukkalatti Deva Yadavaraya. The Sthanattar approached the ruler (1. 81 1209 A.D.) with a request to make adequate provision for the conduct of daily worship in the Tirumala temple and the King set apart the lands in Kudavûr and got the same demarcated with Vishnu Chakram stones. The lands were not however handed over to the Sthanattar, for all one can read in the inscription. All such gifts became the property of the Sri Bhandaram (temple
368
RETROSPECT
properties) which might have formed a separate head of account in the Government Treasury. The Sthanattar would have been receiving only the income from endowments to meet current expenditure. Endowments earmarked for public works (construction and repairs) were credited to a head called &ldquo;Tiruppani Bhandaram.&rdquo; The Sthanattar seem to have acted as agents, but not as trustees of the property.
When there was at a later date a complaint that the income of the temple was insufficient to meet satisfactorily all the demands for the due performance of daily worship and the nimandam of Tiruvengadamudaiyan, Sri Tiruvengaḍanatha Yadavaraya made certain arrangements (Narayanan Sandhi) for the conversion of Tirupati lands as sarvamanya grant and intimated the fact to the Sthanattar for information. (I. 100. 1332 A. D.) வீானத்தார்க்கு நினைப்பு
D
That the Sthanattår were on occasions consulted and their advice even accepted can be seen from the inscription which states that Singayya Dennayaka, at whose request Tiruvenkatanatha set apart Pongalur as a Sarvamanya village for the celebration of Adi Tirunal and the Sitakaragandam Sandhi daily, respectfully approached the Sthanattar for acceptance of the arrangement (I. 103, 1328 A.D.). He also agreed to the Sthanattar&rsquo;s stipulation about the utilisation of any surplus income for certain additional charities such as feeding 32 Brahmins and maintaining a flower garden and water shed. That however, would not show that the Sthanattar had of right any real power.
That the Sthanattars were, at any rate in the view of Singayya Dennayka, a highly respected body in the temple administration may be seen from the wordingஸ்தானத்தார் ஸ்ரீபாதத்தேறி approaching the feet of the Sthanattar, done by so powerful a man as Singayya.
Neither Mangideva nor Sri Vira Kumara Kempanna Udaiyar&rsquo;s Pērkadai nor Bukka mentioned the name of the Sthanattar in

369
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the inscriptions recording their respective endowments, nor of the regnal year of the Yadavaraya.1 We therefore infer that till about 1387 A.D. the Sthanattar did not form a regularly constituted body.
In 1379-80 (1. 184), one Alagappiranar Tirukkali Kanridasar paid 450 panams into the Sri Bhandaram for certain food offerings to be made on occasions. Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar also paid 100 panams into the Sri Bhandaram in 1387 and 1390, with no mention of the name, Sthanattar (I. 185, 186).
Sthanattar figure as Trustees.
For the first time we find in an inscription of 24-2-1387 A.D. (1.228) that the Sthanattar figure as Trustees accepting an endowment by Kollikkavalidasar and on 8-12-1390 A.D. (I. 187, 189) the Sthanattar figure as trustees executing a Silasanam in favour of Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar accepting his endowment of 1200 panams paid into the Sri Bhandaram for making food offerings on the occasion of Tiruppavai singing during ten days in Margali month. Thereafter the Sthanattar figure invariably as trustees accepting endowments and gifts, the siläsäsanam being drawn up by the temple accounts, Tiruninra-ür-udaiyar, under the orders of the Sri Vaishnavas, which latter is only a traditional compliment to the Sri Vaishnava community.
The entry of the Tiruninra-ur-udaiyar (Accountant) was itself an innovation which was started ten years earlier, i.e., in January 1380 A.D. (I. 184).
It is worth while making an attempt to find out why and how the Sthanattar gave up their sub-servience to the Yadavarayas and their successors who were the rulers of the land, and also how and when they constituted themselves as Trustees accepting endowments. There is nothing in the published inscriptions to show that they were so authorised by the rulers. Tiruvenkatanatha Yadavaraya&rsquo;s name appears in I. 100 with his regnal year</li>
<li>T. 179. 1359 A D. 1. 181, 1368 A.D. I. 178

RETROSPECT
12, corresponding to 1332 A.D. Then comes Sriranganatha Yadavaraya&rsquo;s 3rd year which by a process of working backwards appears to be about 1339 A.D. Inscriptions (I. 113, 114, 110) recording gifts of such distinguished military generals as the Erramanchi brothers Periya Pemmu Nayakkar and Pappu Nayakkar Pemmu Nayakkar of the year 1360 mention Sriranganatha Yadavaraya as the ruler.
Sri Ranganatha is said to have built a palace for himself in his 16th regnal year on the Tirumala Hill (I. 109. 1351-52) A.D. to rest his war-weary limbs, after having defeated his foes. After 1360 A.D. his name is not heard of, nor does any successor to his throne and title appear on record. Inscription 1. 110 which obviously speaks of the Yadavaraya as a Rama in battle mentions the year only as Vikari Saka (1281) or 1359-60 A.D. The Yadavaraya&rsquo;s regnal year is not noted there,
There is another matter also to be noted in connection with this name Sri Ranganatha. From tradition, which, also is perfectly true, it is well known that Sri Ranganatha Swami had to be shifted from His Temple in Sri Rangam and after a long and circuitous journey finally found a safe asylum in Tirumala. Dr. S. Krishnaswami Ayyangar recounts in his History of Tirupati, Vol. I, pages 417-421, the Srirangam temple (Kōyil Oluhu) account of this episode But the portion of the story (p. 419) which says that the priest who carried the image of Sri Ranganatha tied himself to the image and got himself let down the steep scarp of a part of the Tirumala hill is really fantastic and unbelievable. Once the image reached the safe height of the Tirumala temple there was as much safty for Sri Ranganatha as for Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan. The fact appears to be that Sri Ranganatha was safely housed in a new, though small, structure within the temple at one end of a big mantapam (since called Ranga mantapam) till he was taken back and installed in Srirangam about 1369-70. Sri Ranganatha&rsquo;s image may have arrived in Tirumala about 1330 or 1332 A.D. No one can however give the exact year. Yadava Sri Ranganatha seems to have commenced his reign about 1336 according to some calculations. Sri Ranganatha of Srirangam may have left Tirumala some time between 1361 and 1367&rsquo;because
371
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the idol was in Senji (Gengee) for some years before being taken to Srirangam in 1371; and the Yadavaraya&rsquo;s name is not heard of after 1360. Was the Yadavaraya&rsquo;s real name Sri Ranganatha, or did he take on the Srirangam God&rsquo;s name under the then circumstances? His predecessor had for himself the name of the Tirumala God, Tiruvenkata.
After the disappearance of the above Yadavarayas some other ruler should have taken their place. From the relative magnitude of gifts made to Tiruvengadamudaiyan by Mangideva, the minister of Sri Vira Kempana Uḍaiyar, and the others, we are led to infer that Mangideva was more devoted to Tiruvengadamuḍaiyan than the others. He was only a subordinate of the Vijayanagar Kings (Bukka I and Harihara). In inditing his gift of gold-gilding the vimanam and kalasam, he does not, in the preamble, give the Vijayanagar regnal year. The inscription is in Telugu as well as Tamil (a new feature). The omission cannot be construed as accidental. He was in all probability the successor to the Yadavarayas in being the Governor of this part of the Vijayanagar territories. He gives only the Saka year Vikari 1281 (I. 179, 180) and does not quote his own regnal year; nor does he quote the regnal year of Bukka I. Vira Kumara Kempana Udaiyar likewise quotes (I. 181) only the cyclic year Kilaka.
In the wake of these comes another inscription of January 1380 A.D. (I. 184) by one Alagappirännär Tirukkalikanri Dasar, a Srivaishnava of Tirupati, which also quotes only the Saka year 1301, Siddharti. For the first time it is observed that the inscription is. the draft of Tiruninra-ür-udaiyan, the temple accountant, a new officer of the temple.
Reading between the lines the inference is that after Sri Rangamatha swami was removed from Tirumala and after the demise of the Yadava Sri Ranganatha, there was some confusion in the management of the Tirumala temple and that a full time and qualified accountant was found essential for the proper maintenance of records. So the Sthanattar seem to have imported one of the Tirumlára-ur-udalyar a little before January 1380 A.D. In 1387 (L. 228) the Sthanattar set themselves up as the full-fledged trustees of the
372
RETROSPECT
Devasthanam and not merely the executive agency which they were under the Yadavarayas. This is a step they had to take and which they were quite competent to do. The ruler of the country (whoever he may have been) due to the political turmoils prevailing could not be expected to bestow any attention worth the name to the temple affairs. The interest of the Yadavarayas is taken to have commenced with Ghatti Deva about 1100 A.D. and lasted till 1360 A.D. for two centuries and a half. Any new ruler was yet to acquire a spiritual or sentimental attachment to the temple. The Sthanattar at the time were men of high character and reputation. We saw that Singayya Dannayaka approached their feet with great respect and even Tiruvengatanatha had to couch his edicts as being made for their hearing (). In reference to the Sthanattar setting themselves, up as full-fledged trustees, an incomplete inscription in Sanskrit Grantha Script on the north wall (left inner side) of the base of the Paḍi Kavali Gopuram in Tirumala may perhaps be considered relevant. It is to the effect (as translated by the epigraphist 1. 161).
.the best king having deceased&hellip;.. the proper course being adopted மதவ வாணா நே; கடிம (NOTE:-Perhaps the portions left dotted above are being hidden by some wall or other and could be read if the obstruction is removed).
If the inscription refers to the death of Sri Ranganatha Yadavaraya and to the subsequent course of independent action taken by the Sthanattar, the relevancy may be admitted.
Although the Sthanattar set themselves to be the effective trustees of the Devasthanams, royal Dharmasasanas were being issued without any specific mention of the Sthanattar. Thus Sri Virapratapa Devaraya Maharaya&rsquo;s Dharmasasana recorded in Kannada on the Bangaru Vakil (or door jamb covered with gilded copper plate at the entrance to the main shrine in Tirumala) on the occasion of the Emperor&rsquo;s visit on Monday, the Sukla Dasami of Margasira, Saumya year (Saka 1351) (5th December 1429) (I. 192) makes the statement that two thousand two hundred honnu (gold) were transferred from the Raja Bhandara to the Chandragiri Bhandara and that in addition three villages mentioned therein were also
373HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
granted as Sarvamanya for the celebration of a nine days&rsquo; festival every year and for certain other daily services. There is no mention of the Sthanattar as trustees taking charge of these properties. So also when Sirigiresvara, son of Vissanna Devaraya, presented his gold pattam (1-7-1430) I. 193 set with gems to the God of the Sri Venkata Hill, there is no mention of the Sthanattar. The sila sasanam is in Sanskrit (Grantha characters).
Teppada Nagaya Nayakkaru (son of Muddaya Nayara) on (I. 209) 12-1-1443 executed his dharmasasana in Kannada denoting 3000 honnu for preparing three gold plates in his name and another 100 pon for a daily offering of two flower garlands, two barivāha and eight upora&hellip;.
The Sthanattars are enjoined
to carry out this charity scrupulously (12-1-1443).
Specific mention is not made of the composition of this council or committee of Sthanattar. There need be no doubt that it would have taken about 30 years for this body to take a definite shape after 1360 A.D. After the disappearance of the Yadavarayas from the temple overlordship and after Sri Ranganathaswami was taken back to Srirangam there must have been great need felt for overhauling the accounts and verifying temple properties. A staff of competent accountants was set up in the temple and we found in 1379-80 that the Tiruninra-ur udaiyan made his debut. Ten years later in 1390 the Sthanattar as a self-constituted body came to view. Their composition is revealed in the same inscription No. 187 which has already been noticed. Therein is found a scheme of distribution of the quarter share of the prasadams due to the donor of the gift. Among others the Sthanattar are allotted a share in the following proportion making a total of 12 nirvāhams:1-

So we draw the inference that the Sthanattar were twelve in
Humber.
Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar.
Inscription 187 Vol. I of 1390 refers to an endowment by one Mullai Tiruvenkata jiyar, manager of the Arisäṇalayam matham and nandavanam. We must know how he came in, for he and his successors were destined to play their part in this temple.
We have seen that Singayya Dannayaka transferred the Arisanalayam Nandavanams and the mathams at Tirumala and a Tirupati to a certain Siyan or Jiyar for management and for the enjoyment of emoluments therefrom during his lifetime, after the due performance of certain charities in the temple (I. 104, 1339 A.D.). The stipulation was that, on the demise of that Siyan or Jiyar his successor should be appointed by the Dannayakars alone from among the Desäntaries (or outsiders). We do not know when that Siyan died. But we find in January 1388 and in June 1390 (I. 185, 186) that one Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar came forward as the agent of Hariharaya paying 100 panams for the performance of a festival (masi-Tirumal) in the name of Harihararaya. On 8th December 1390 (1. 187), he described himself as the Manager of the Arisanalayam Tirunandavanam at Tirumala and made an endowment of 1200 panams as capital for certain festivals. He was a Sanyasi. But he does not state in the inscriptions relating to his endowments who his guru or acharya was. Sishyas (and more so Sanyasis) consider it a sacred duty and an honour to acknowledge their acharya on all possible occasions. It is evident that he got possession of the Arisanalayam Tirunandavanam between June and December 1390 through the favour of Harihararaya himself. It must be that the Siyar or Jiyer appointed in 1339 by Dannayaka died and that there was no Dannayaka to appoint a successor. The Tamil word Arisanalayam Tirunandavanam indicates that the Arasan or (King) planted a Tirunanda-

vanam or garden for the use of the alayam or temple (owb). The words mean the temple garden planted by the King. It was probably a temple property and Mullai Tiruvenkata jiyar was made its Kartar by the Vijayanagar King Harihara.

FROM the analysis of the composition of the Sthanattar given in the previous chapter it will be seen that it is not quite similar to the composition of the &lsquo;Sthanikas&rsquo; in other important temples. The term &lsquo;Sthānikas&rsquo; usually conveys the impression that it is composed of the religious functionaries in a temple, who receive a sort of preferential treatment in the matter of being served with tirtham and prasādam (consecrated water and food) in the gōshti or assembly of worshippers. In the Tirumala and Tirupati temples this class is represented by the Archakas, the Jiyangars and the Acharya purushas. The Sthanattar form a different class whose function is secular and not religious, although there can be no rigid line of demarcation drawn between the two. In fact some of the Sthanattar particularly the Tiruninra-ür-uḍaiyars, were the spiritual disciples of the Acharyapurushas, usually showing a respect to the Acharya which would prevent their sitting together on a footing of equality.
The political changes in the country have already been reviewed to explain the emergence of the Sthanattar as Independent Trustees. There were also religious and social conditions which contributed to this step.
Srirangam which stood out as the foremost rallying point for Vaishnavas from time immemorial became a vulnerable place. Kanchipuram, which took the next rank ever since Sri Ramanuja promulgated his Visishtadvaita philosophy, did not also prove to be the safest place. All Sri Vaishnavas had to look to Tiruvengadam when the Muslims remorselessly demolished and pillaged the temples, broke the idols and forcibly converted or massacred Hindu men and abducted Hindu women. Tirumala somehow

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
escaped the danger and all the religious minded Sri Vaishnavar counted on the God of the Vengadam Hills for the safety of theis religion. In Vengadam the Tamilian came into contact with the Kannada Hoysalas, the Telugu Chalukyas, the Telugu Pallavas and others attached to the new Vijayanagar Kings of the Sangama line. The past history and affluence of the Tirumala temple was till then bound up with the fortunes of the Tamil-loving Chōlas, Pandyas, Yadavarayas and Gandagopalas. The Muslim invasion completely crushed these kings and put an end as well to their rivalries. For the moment the Muslim danger was arrested by their combined action. But who will rise as the next dominant Hindu power was yet an uncertain matter in the period between 1340 and 1390. Yadava Sri Ranganatha died about 1360 A.D. and the religious order of the temple which hitherto looked to him for support had to chalk out its own future and it did so.
Separation of secular administration from the
religious propaganda.
The task before them was not merely one of keeping the temple services and festivals going without a break. It was certainly more than that. Sri Vedanta Desika and Pillai Lokacharya represented the cream of the Tamil speaking Sri Vaishnavas and were the real inspirers and guides at the time. There were also the local Acharyapurushas, the numerous Jiyars and their followers in the mathams who came from the extreme south, the Sabhaiyars of Tiruchchukanur and the Archakas, all of whom had an abiding interest in the temple. They seem to have realised that they could not confine their activities to the Tamil country alone if their temples and Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s Visishtadvaitam were to gain predominance in the land. They could not rely solely on the support of the kings as their position itself was unstable. They had therefore to educate the masses and make them religious-minded. For the achievement of the latter object Sri Vedānta Dēsika had already produced an unsurpassable volume of literature in Tamil bringing the highest truths within the easy reach and understanding of the common man. Similar work had to be undertaken for the Kannada and the Telugu countries. The Brahmatantra Swami,
378
EXPANSION OF SRI VAISHNAVA ACTIVITIES
an immediate disciple of Sri Vedanta Desika, had taken up his place in the Mysore country for this work. The Telugu country needed attention. The plan therefore seems to have been that the Acharyapurushas-how many families they were at the time we do not know, but they number seven now-should take up propaganda and proselytising work, retaining at the same time their peculiar spiritual position in Tirumala and Tirupati, and leave it to the Sthanattar to manage the secular affairs of the temples. Adi Van Sathakōpaswami also started his evangelical mission about the middle of the 15th century and his successors of the Ahobila Mutt carried on the mission in the Telugu country penetrating even into Orissa. The history of the temple from 1390 A.D. onwards, when the new scheme might be considered to have been put into effect, shows how remarkably well this system worked. While time had an adverse effect on the fortunes of other temples, the Tirumala temple went on towering higher and higher.
How the Scheme worked.
A cursory reading of the inscriptions of the 15th and 16th centuries A.D. shows that within a century and a half they were able to make the different branches of the royal family with their ministers and generals the spiritual disciples of a mutt or of one or the other of the Acharyapurusha families. The great agricultural and trading communities had likewise been made Sri Vaishnavas.
The equality of social treatment which all were accorded in the presence of the Deity was a great cementing factor between the Acharya and the disciple. Some of the Acharyapurushas went even a bit further in bridging social inequalities. Even in so conservative a function as the Sraddha they so arranged the ceremonial functions, that at a certain stage all their disciples could come and worship before the sacrificial fire. The Acharyapurushas were not behind their opulent disciples in making endowments to the temple. In not a few cases the amounts were large. In one notable instance a village Pedda Ekkalur, with an annual net income of 2000 varahas gifted by the Vijayanagar King Sadasivaraya Maharaya to Sottai Tirumalai Nambi Srinivasa Ayyangar,
379
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
was soon after transferred to his God Tiruvengadamudaiyan as an endowment for the perpetual performance of certain festivals etc. The same person made a subsequent endowment of villages with an annual income of about 1000 varahas. The moral effect of the transactions could not but have had an elevating influence on his disciples. All these charities will be catalogued in due course. Here it has to be remembered that the members of these Acharyapurushas and other families connected with this temple were not leading a parasitic existence. They worked with a will for the spread of their religion and for maintaining the high traditions of their temple. The prefixing of the word Tirumala to their name was a matter of great pride. It is decidedly so even to this day in the Telugu and Kannada countries from Ganjam downwards. Whatever the family name may be the prefixing of the word Tirumala has always been considered a great honour and privilege. In the Tamil country a Tatachari in whatever part of the country he may be, claims ancestry from Tirumalai Nambi. The disappearance of the Tamil kings and the emergence of the Vijayanagar kings and their dependents brought about this transformation. These Acharyapurushas and the Mathadhipatis overspread the land for doing evangelical work in the name of Tiruvengadamuḍaiyān. They had temples built in various places. There is a Dwaraka Tirumala in the West Godavary district. There were Venkatesvara temples built in very many villages. So also temples to Narasimhaswami. They did the pratishtha and received the Tirtham in these temples. The temples assumed the status of Tirthaparigraham temples for all others. The Antarvēdi Narasimhaswami temple in the East Godavary district owes its origin to the Prativadi Bhayankaram family; the Simhachalam temple to the first Van Sathakopa Jiyar and so also the one in Mangalagiri. These Acharyapurushas and Mathādhipatis did not make religion a close preserve in their own hands. The religious orders known as Sattada Srivaishnavas, the Konda dasaris and the Mala dasaris bear testimony to their efforts to take religious instruction to the very door of even the lowliest and the loneliest of Hindus. The Sättäda Sri Vaishnavas were drawn from all classes of non-brahmin caste-Hindus. The Konda dasaris&rsquo; work lay with the hill tribes living in lonely places. The Mala dasaris&rsquo; work was among the
380
EXPANSION OF SRI VAISHNAVA ACTIVITIES
antyajas. These dasaris were the trusted disciples of the Acharyapurushas and continue to be so even to this day. Their civil and even petty criminal disputes are adjudicated by their Acharya. They do not go to any other court. The Sättada Sri Vaishnava was as well-versed in the Tiruvoimoli as the Sattina Srivaishnava and ministered to the religious needs of a section of Hindus. They performed puja also in certain temples and do so even now.
For the benefit of the dasaris a religious literature was got up in the form of songs which they get by heart. These songs enshrine the highest philosophical doctrines and forms of worship. When they appear in public with the lamp and the going in hand they arrest attention. The light symbolises true knowledge and the gong symbolises the divine call to reform one&rsquo;s life and conduct.
There are in the Telugu country very many Tirumalai Tatacharis. Prativādi Bhayankarams, Nallanchakravartis, Māḍabhusis, Naḍādurs and other families who do not know the Tamil alphabet or the language, but yet get by heart the Tiruvoymoli in Telugu script. They are the descendants of families who infiltrated into the Telugu country after 1390 A.D. All of them take pride in calling themselves Tirumalaivaramu.
It was not the Acharyapurushas alone who did this work of proselytising and of bringing adherents and benefactions to the Tirumala Temple. There was the Brahma Tantram or Parakalaswami with his Math in Mysore. The Maharajas of Mysore have been for very many generations the disciples of the Parakalamaṭham. There was the Van Sathakopan Nandavanam and matham in Tirumala early in the 14th century A. D. which ultimately became the Ahobila mutt. The founder of this mutt was Adi van Sathakopaswami who was the spiritual guru of the great Telugu poet Allasani Peddanna. The mutt&rsquo;s influence was felt all over the Andhra country right upto Orissa. The Tallapakam poets and philosophers of the great Nandavarika family who became ardent Sri Vaishnavas also contributed to making Sri Vaishnavism popular in the Telugu country.
Then came the great Vyasaraya Mutt during the reign of Krishnadevaraya with its unrivalled hold on the Kannada country. All
381
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
the Vaishnava mutts considered it a great privilege to have a foothold in Tirumala and to receive honours in the temple. Standing on a Hill where the Tamil, the Telugu and the Kannadigas meet, this Deity of Tiruvengadam continues to draw more and more devotees to His Shrine as the centuries roll on.
Local Support and Royal benefactions.
But it took five or six decades before any tangible results could be detected in the popularity of the shrine in the Telugu country. During this period, the residents of Tirupati and of the villages around it did not fail in their duty. The note a&rsquo; the end of this chapter shows a list of all their endowments. The endowments by the local people took the form of food offerings. The reason was that in the unsettled condition of the country what the pilgrim wanted was food. If the endowments made by the residents of Tirupati and the surrounding villages have been enumerated, it is not to produce the impression that the Sangama kings and their officers did nothing for this temple. Bukkaraya I endowed for a daily Sandhi offering and for a Brahmotsavam in the month of Kartigai. This was about 1365 A.D. Harihara II gave in 1387 A.D. probably on the persuasion of Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar 100 panams a year for the Masi Brahmotsavam, which capitalised at the rate of interest in those days would be about 1000 panams (1. 185). Giridevappagal, younger brother of Santappa Naggappan, probably an officer under Hari Hara II, endowed 600 panams for the purchase of a flower garden and the Lakshmi Narasimha mantapam and for food offerings on a particular festival day (I. 191; 18-12-1404 A.D.).
Neither Bukka II, nor Devaraya I, nor Vira Vijaya, the successors of Harihara II seem to have made any gifts or endowments during their reign i.e., till we reach 1419 A.D. There is nothing to be wondered at if these Kings were indifferent to the Tirumala Temple. They were in the midst of a life and death struggle with the Muslim Brahmin Kings. They were also all largely under Saivite influence. The only Vaishnava temple within easy reach for them was that of Ahobila Narasimhaswami.
382
EXPANSION OF SRI VAISHNAVA ACTIVITIES
Even this may be due to the fact that Sri Sankaracharya has sung the Lakshmi Narasimhastotram. The Upper Ahobilam temple (on the Hill) is a compromise temple where Ugra Narasimha and Siva Lingam stand in amity with only a stone screen cut out of the hill rock separating the two. It is in fact a Hari Hara Kshethram. Kings with an ambition to carve out an Empire could not afford to label themselves as belonging to this or that sect. Attachment to a particular Deity is however inculcated by the slow growth of the belief that success is due to the special favour of a particular Deity enshrined in a particular temple. This faith in Tiruvēngaḍamuḍaiyan had yet to catch the imagination of the Vijayanagar Kings. The Acharyas played no small part in shaping this faith. There is the tradition about how the Rayar of Vijayanagar became the spiritual disciple of a Venkata Dikshitar of the Tirumalai Nambi family of Tirupati and made a grant of the village Bodipad (thereafter renamed as the present Rayadurg) in addition to Ettür and Immadi. At the instance of his Acharya, nine more families of different gōtras were imported to make it possible for his Acharya to reside in that country and carry on his havyakavya. It was all the result of a dream which the Acharya had while halting one night in a village called Hanumanthagundam (Kurnool district) on his return journey from Ahobilam after attending the Brahmotsavam there. His dream of a Bimba of Nrisimha being buried in a white ant-hill and asking him to get it exhumed by the king. It proved true and the Rayar became a disciple of the Acharya who was well known as a great pandit of saintly character. This is a story which we may believe or not. But the fact remains that in the life of men certain inexplicable incidents create deep impression and faith. The descendants of this Acharya are living in Anagundi and other places in the Bellary District. Till we go to the year 1429-1430 A.D. we do not find any strong attachment to the God of Tiruvengadam among the members of the royal family of Vijayanagar.
In 1430 Srigirisvara the son of Vissanna Devaraya who is identified as the brother of Devaraya II, presented a gold pattam set with gems to &ldquo;Sri Venkatadri Prabhu&rdquo; (I. 193, 1-7-1430).
383HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
In 1433 Tirukkalikkanri dasar Alagappiranar was able to prevail upon Uḍaiyar Devana Udayar (Devaraya II) to help instituting Vedaparayanam recital in Tirumala, which as could be seen from the series of transactions involved, (as shown by the inscription I. 199 to 203) was no easy matter.
In 1443 Teppada Nagaya Nayakkar, son of Muddayya Nayakar (obviously an officer under the King), donated 3000 pon (30000 panams) for three gold plates for presenting food offerings daily to the Deity and also another 100 pon (1000 panams) for the daily food offerings (Kannada Inscription I. 209).
In 1446 Periya Mallaya Deva Maharaja (Mahamandalesvara Mēdini Misaraganda Kaṭhāri Sāluva) paid 1000 panams for offering 1 Tiruppōnakam daily (I. 210). In 1450 Siru Mallaya Deva Maharaja, son of Malagangayadeva (of the same family as above) paid 1200 panams for 1 Tiruppōnakam daily (I. 218).
In 1429 Sriman Maharajadhiraja Rajaparamesvara Sri Virapratapa Devaraya Maharaya gave three villages and 2200 ponnu (22000 panams) for a daily offering of 30 platefuls of food etc., and instituted a Brahmotsavam in Tirumala to be celebrated in the month of Asvija (I. 192; 5-12-1429).
It will be noted that Devaraya II and Teppada Nagaya Nayakkar showed by the largeness of their endowments a more than passing faith in Venkatadri Prabhu.
It will thus be seen that by a scheme of devolution of responsibility the Acharyapurashas and the Matadhipathies gave a new drive to make people realise the high ideals for which this temple stood, so that there may be no dependence on kings alone. This was the good that came out of the evil of the Muslim invasion.
Note:-List of endowments made by local people.
Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar made two endowments in 1390 and 1393 amounting in all to 1800 panams. Mallanna or Madhava
384
EXPANSION OF SRI VAISHNAVA ACTIVITIES
Dasar of Chandragiri made an endowment for one Tirupponakam offering daily in 1409 and constructed the Tirumamani mantapam in front of the Tirumala shrine in 1417 A.D.
Mallanḍayar&rsquo;s (Chandragiri) endowment dated 2-10-1444 was for two Tirupponakam daily (irrigation channels dug),
Through the efforts of Tirukkalikkanri Dasar Alagappirānar, Udaiyar Devana Udaiyar made over to the Temple the Raja Bhandaram income from Siddhakkuṭṭai for instituting Vedaparayanam service in Tirumala (which was not being done till then) from 1433 A.D. Since the amount was found insufficient to maintain 24 Brahmins for the purpose, all the villagers of the sixteen Tiruvidaiyattam villages of the Temple undertook to contribute yearly 200 panams (1. 200, 201, 202, 203). The same Alagappiranar instituted the Arunodayam Sandhi for six months in a year and some other food offerings also (4000 panams) (I. 207, 208).
In 1442 A.D. Karunakaradasar, a Sättāda Sri Vaishnava of Tirupati made an endowment offering one Tirupponakam daily. Smaller offerings on occasions were instituted by Alvar Mudaliyar, Ulagudaiya Perumal and Govindan Tiruvandālvär accountants from 1445 (450 panams) (1. 212).
The Sabhaiyars of Tiruchchukanur (probably members of the Sthanattar Committee) viz., Anantasayanar and Vadamamalai❤ dasar, Alagar Appillai alias Tiruvanandalvar Periya perumal, also one Alagiya perumal, son of Ramanuja dasar made endowments of 300 panams, 120 panams and 200 panams respectively for food offerings on certain festival days (I. 213, 215, 216; 1445 and 1446 A.D.).
Koyil Kelvi Emperumanar Jiyar who perhaps was the successor of Mullai Tiruvenkata Jiyar, from about 1445 A.D., made a number of endowments all of which were for food offerings on the various Brahmotsavam festival days at Tirumala and Tirupati. They are of the value of 2000, 1000, 1000, 1000 and 5000 panams respectively (total 10,000). The dates of these endowments extend
25
385
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
over a period of 12 years from 1445-1457 A.D. (I. 219, 20, 221, 222 and 223). One Channakesava Dasar excavated in 1450 &hellip;D. an irrigation channel for Tirupati lands at a cost of 1000 panams (1.224) and from the proceeds certain food offerings in ..is name were to be made. One Rama Dasar, a hermit living in Papanasa Waterfalls, endowed 1000 panams for one food offering daily (7-7-1454) (I. 225). One Perumal (Kollikkavalidasar) a Sri Vaishnava of Tirupati paid 1000 panams as fund for one food offering daily (for Govindaraja), (I. 228, 1387 A.D.). There are a few other fragmentary inscriptions whose dates cannot be fixed. A Periyaperumaldasar Devaman made a fair amount of deposit about 13-12-1445.Hariyappa of Chandragiri paid 3000 panams for one food offering and for feeding 12 Brahmins daily. (II. 2, 25-8-1454 A.D.).
Thus the total endowments by the residents of the place amounted to about 24000 panams during the period 1380 to 1450 (or 70 years).
In 1464 A.D. Sottai Tirumalai Nambi Tōlappar Ayyangar made an endowment of 7000/panams for offering every night one appapadi to Sri Govindaraja.

APPENDICES
APPENDIX I-(TO CHAPTER I)
Reprint of an article relating to the Tirumala Temple published in the Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British and Foreign India, China and Australia, issue of May-August, 1831 A.D.1
This temple is distinguished by oblations which are offered to its God by Vishnu&rsquo;s Votaries from all parts of the Indian world. Princes send vakeels or ambassadors to present their offerings to the shrine; whilst the poorer peasant, who may have little else to offer, wraps up some petty oblation in a piece of waxcloth, a handful of rice stained with manjall makes it into a larger packet. The cause of these offerings is as follows: the idol smitten with love for the blooming Tudmavutta daughter of Akasarajah of Narrainennum in the Bomrauze Zemindaree determined to espouse her. but wanting coin for the matrimonial expenses, he raised with wind by the aid of Cuvera the Indian Plutus. This God, however, directed that the monies thus lent should be repaid annually to the sovereign of the countries lying between the Palaur and Soona mookai rivers, and the votaries at the shrine pour in great numbers during the Brahmotsavam or nine days celebration of the nuptials; and annually at this period two thirds of the usual collection are made.
The Brahmins maintain that the Hindu Princes allowed the revenues from this source to bo entirely employed on the spot in</li>
<li>The author is indebted to Sri M. C. Subramania Iyer, Assistant Curator, Madras Records Office, for bringing this article to notice
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
religious ceremonies and that the musaulman first appropriated on the score of the above claim, the produce of these oblations. During the early wars we had with the French, in this part of the world, this source of revenue was one of the first fruits of our conquests; though certainly its legitimacy is much to be doubted. These offerings or caunickee, are made generally from interested motives, and are of every diversity or articles conceivable; gold and silver lumps, coins of all sorts, bags of rupees, copper money, spices, asofotidea, the hair cut off the head, frequently vowed from infancy, and given up by some beautiful virgin in compliance with her parents&rsquo; oath. A man who is lame presents a silver leg; if blind a silver or gold eye; in fact there would bo no end when I enumerate the various ways in which Hindu superstition develops itself on this occasion. The jewels which a woman has worn with pride from infancy are voluntarily left before the idol; she appears with a shabby cloth before the stone God, and presents a spléndid one which has never been worn, she tears the bangles from her infant&rsquo;s little legs and fondly hopes that the God whom she &ldquo;sees in the clouds and hears in the wind&rdquo; will shower down his blessings on her and hers. She has haply travelled hundreds of miles and accomplished her object: and perhaps before a journey which to her might have been one of terror, never left her village and bosom of her own family. The birth of a son, reconciliation with enemies, success against the foe, safe termination of a journey, the marriage of a son or daughter, prosperity in trade, enjoyment of health. and the reverse of these are among the reasons which lead together in the direction of Tripetty, the wise as well as the ignorant heathens.
The offerings are not always presented by the interested party. They may be sent by relations, friends, vakeels; but they are frequently forwarded by Goseynes. A goseyne is a servant of the temple; there are a considerable number of them. A few months of the Brahmotsavam, they set out in different directions, and reaching the country they intend to commence their operations insin, they unfurl the sa and flag of the God, with which cach is entrusted. Round the idolatarous banner the Hindus gather and either entrust their offerings to its bearer, or carry the caunickee
APPENDIX I
themselves to the foot of the idol. A sufficient mass being congregated the blind leader of the blind strikes the standard and returns whither he came in time for a nuptial anniversary. The former of the customs generally permit all pilgrims to pass free to the temple. The Goseynes seldom are detected in stealing the caunickee entrusted to their care, but they no doubt derive some emolument from the pilgrim as their presence alone secures them from trouble; taxation and other annoyance. As they journey they chaunt out, every five or six minutes and attributes of the God-&rdquo; Gov. Göv. Govinda Al May-Mungoo&hellip;.,&quot; the whole party men, women and children successively take up the word as rapidly as possible, and then simultaneously burst out with it. On my road to Tripetty we passed several groups of these besoted heathens and it made the road quite lively whilst, strange anomaly, a slight reflexion excited mournful feelings.
The offerings are, of course, of various extent; they seldom exceed 1000 rupees. The God compliments the worshippers at his alter with presents proportioned to the liberality of their oblation; if the victim gives 100 rupees, he receives a turband; from 100 to 500, a flowered silk vestment; from this to 1000, a shawl, etc. A second source of revenue is called Wurtena, presents given to the idol for its own use; whether jewels or horse&rsquo;s cloths, etc. The donor is made to pay the estimate value of the offering to government before he is allowed to make the idol its present; however the article is then retained for the use of the temple. A third source of revenue is designated Arjectum, or receipts and is of three classes, viz., Abhishekam or purifications; Naivaidoom or offerings; Wahanums or processions.
&ldquo;1st Abbeesheykoom, every Friday throughout the year the idol is anointed with civet, musk, camphor etc., and washed clean again with milk. So important a spectacle cannot be seen for love, and the devotee, desirous of viewing the operation, pays what he chooses during the rest of the year, but at Bramhautsowum, pays through the nose, in a sum formerly more, but now reduced to fifty rupees. This ceremony of rubbing, scrubbling and causing the God to smell sweet, and vice versa, is styled poolkaub. 2nd Porlungee Seeva, or enrobing his excellence the God in a flower

Twleve rupees are paid under this head by all who delight in seeing the idol decorated with a necklace of flowers, and this pleasure may, for this daily payment, be enjoyment for 365 days of the year. 4th Sahasranamarchana. This term, signifies the diurnal worship of the god under his thousand names; five rupees is the price of this piece of devotion. 5th Munsoon Seva is an imposing ceremony, and the spectator yields forth twelve rupees for seeing the mighty object of his worship rocked to sleep;
&ldquo;Proceed we to raivedoom, or offerings: 1st Annaidioom. Under this head are 1st Purmanum, 2nd Poolecayarrum, 3rd Mudgarrum and 4th Duddudavam.
The first is an offering of milk, sugar, rice; the second tamarinds, sweet oil and rice; the third doll ghee (clarified butter) and rice; 4th buttermilk and rice. These good offerings may be prepared severally by the offerer at option, in which case he pays six rupees only, but if the circar prepared he pays sixteen; second Bugchana vaidoom, or offerings of sweetmeats; the devotee has the offering prepared by the circar, and twenty to twenty eight rupees are paid for the honour of presenting it. Third, Malamavaidoom1 (maha naivedyam) commonly called Teeroopowra2 (Tiruppaavadai) is a large offering are from 1000 to 2000 puccah seers of rice provided by the circar but paid for in one hundred or two hundred pagodas. Fourth Amunthanarumoocha&rsquo; (Amantharana utsavam) are united offerings of all daily offers, but of course for a less extent. The price is sixty five rupees. Fifth Ookaipadchadee a presentation of the plant Ookai sitloo (4 ep peculiar to the Tripetty hill. This is four rupees.
There remains now to describe Vahanum or processions of the idol. They are twelve in number and each has a reference to</li>

different parts of a Hindu mythology as connected with the adoration of Vishnu. (The idol exhibited on these occasions is a gilded representation made of metal, of the stone fellow in the temple who is too lazy to turn out himself).
Kalpa Varucha Vahanam is a procession of the idol placed under a gilt wooden tree. Andoleeka Vahanam is a procession attending his excellency in a palankeen; Sesha Vahanum is the God carried forth on a gilt serpent sesha. Saroah Bhoopala Vahanam signifies the carrying the idol on a gilt throne; Suria prabha Vahanum is a procession of the idol attended by a gilt sun. Addah arah is a trip of the gentleman to a room surrounded by looking glasses adjusted to reflect him several times; Andola Vahanum is another kind of palankeen procession. For all the above the votary who gives the idol the trouble of coming out is forty rupees less rich than he was before. Gudu Vahanam is a procession in which the idol is mounted on a gilt parrot; Chandra prabah is a procession of the idol accompanied by a gilt moon; Hanumantha Vahanam is a procession of the idol mounted upon a gilt figure like an elephant. Sometime in representation of Hanuman, the Indian pan. Simha Vahanam is a procession in which the idol rides a gilt lion. Bala sesha Vahanam is the last procession of the idol sitting upon a gilt serpent.&rdquo;
The whole of the revenue of the temple, from whatever source derived, are under the management of and appropriated by the circar or government. A regular establishment is entertained paid by salaries; and a horde of bramins are maintained by lands, appropriated for that purpose, over the face of the surrounding country, called manniyums or estates enjoyed on very favourable terms under government, subject only to a slight jody or tax. The temple is kept up in all its dignity; and the average receipts on the account of government, for the last ten years, or fuslies, will show what a good thing we make of it. The head general officer there is called Tahsildar, whose business is the general superintendence over the others; to see the pilgrims are well treated and lodged in proper places; supplies kept fairly in the bazaars, ceremonies duly performed as paid for, and that no bribery, tyranny or oppression of any sort takes place. He reports to the collector or his
5HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
assistants, according to orders, on all cases of doubt or importance. Next is the Sheristadar or head native accountant, who acts under the tahsildar, assists him in all his responsible duties, and superintends the regularly kept accounts of all disbursements and receipts for the use of the temple. Under him are four gumastas or native writers. The rysagu is a police clerk and is assisted by a ghola and obeys the tahsildar in all magisterial matters. Common servants are allowed for taking care of dufters, or records, lighting, sweeping the cutchery and etc., and twenty peons attend the tahsildar&rsquo;s cutchery and are paid a pagoda (8 shillings) a month; with the duffedars or head peons with larger salary. During the Bramhautsoeem or nine days festival an additional sibbandi is allowed with twenty five peons, twenty putwars (and that kind of peon in lower salaries) and five hircurraks or scouts to bring intelligence of the arrival of any pilgrim of rank, and to keep the peace among the enormous crowd that annually fills this part of the country. They also assist the tahsildar with forty or fifty peons, a party of whom are constantly on the hills looking out for the thieves who congregate where the prey may be, whilst another party range the country, assisted by the village police, who apprehend suspicious characters. A company also of sepoys under a native officer are stationed as the tahsildar may choose as permanent guards. The temple has attached to it a granary and store house under charge of Jeengar and Ekangi or his deputy. These have under them a goomasta an Allowagar or grain measurer, three peons, a sandal-wood carrier, a flower carrier, a musk extractor, a pottu, a wood-man for the cook, a golla, a sweeper, a mossoli or man to light up the place. The tahsildar always sees that the store has a sufficient stock for any sum upon it. He keeps regular accounts of all that enters the granary. The Jeengar keeps account of all that is disbursed upon the orders of the Parapatyadar or manager of the temple. The Parapatyadar or manager supplies daily ration of food to all the numerous servants of the temple; sees that they all do their several duties and is second only to the tahsildar in general superintendence. He takes care that the gifts presented are duly disposed of, searches the guards and others over the place for receiving the offerings and with the result of the day&rsquo;s oblations accompanies them to the tahsildar who with him seals

up in gunny bags whatever is collected in money, jewels and copper plates, etc. Attached to this officer is a goomastah, alowghar and four peons, and he keeps another account of all he receives from the stores. The offerings of foods, sweets, etc., presented by the pilgrims are prepared for them by his orders and his accounts are counter examined by the tahsildar. The parapatyadar previous to drawing in any large quantity on the store sends the estimate to the tahsildar who signs it.
&ldquo;Passing through the Bangaru Vakili or silver porch the pilgrims are admitted into a rather confined part and are introduced to the God in front of whom are two vessels, one called the gangalam or vase, the other Kopra or large cup and into these things votaries drop their respective offerings and making their obeisance pass out through another door. At the close of the day the guards both of peons and sepoys round these vessels are searched. Without examination of any sort offerings are thrown into bags and are sealed first with the seal of the pagoda, then by the tahsildar and jeengar; after which the bag is sent down to the cutchery below the hill Govindarauz pettai. At the end of the month those bags are transmitted to our cutchery here or huzur (meaning the presence); and they are there opened, sorted, valued and finally sold at auction. However during the Brahmotsavam either the collector or a subordinate must be on the spot owing to the value of the offerings, there number the crowds of people, and to see that no cheating takes place from the want of power of immediate representation. And on the duty I was bound when I wrote from Chandragiri. I have little more to add except the average revenue of the last ten years. The annual nett proceeds from this source is about eighty seven thousands rupees. In 1822 collections were one lakh fortytwo thousand and odd but this is exclusive of expenses, wherewith twenty thousand may be deducted. In 1820 or fasli 1230 the collections were 1,02,000.
You may perhaps start at such organised system of religious, or rather you will say profane, plunder on the part of the government, but such, strange as it may appear, is far from the case. Those who without just reflection join the spiritless cry against, our government are rejoiced in soul to start up such a topic as

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
this, as an admirable specimen of what, with other things, should draw down vengeance of heaven on us. The fact is this: we find that the resources of the pagoda were legitimately enjoyed by the musalman government, for services earned with blood and presence, and that at the risk of losing our trade on the coramandel coast. One of the first rewards, or rather poor payment, was this revenue; and it has been paid unremittingly ever since. We found the allowing the temple to support itself upon its own funds lead to the grossest imposition upon settlement of Kists; moreover that the only cultivation in that part of the country was in the hands of Bramins who cannot legally touch a plough; and therefore all other castes of riots were virtually their slaves; and it was absurd for them to dream of holding lands when it embraced competition with Vishnu&rsquo;s Bramins under the very nose of the sacred Hill; the consequence was the priests had it all their own way: labour was drawn towards their district to the comparative impoverishment of the surrounding ones; and such was found to be the case all over the presidency. Every village pagoda was the petty oppresser of its range, and the influence only stopped when the effects of a neighbouring one interfered with it. It was a strange but determined piece of policy when throughout the country the pagoda lands were resumed by the company and tustik allowance granted in their place; the lands passed into other hands and the riches solely grasped by the Bramin are diffused amongst the real cultivators of the soil and the coffers of the state replenished by the new stimulus thus afforded to every branch of native manufacture. Our tenure of the country was then very precarious; and while as to the Hindu, he has fought, and will fight again perhaps sooner than we think of; and the experience of ages tells us what religious enthusiasm or fanaticism or call it what you will-will do when wrought up to despair. What did we? Why, secured them in the exercise of their religion-tolerated it-we never encouraged it. We could not if we would. Now let us contemplate result of this plan. From one end of the country to the other pagodas are ruined, unmaintained. Bramins are in trade, serving in the army and generally learning that even to them begging is no livelihood. The oppressive hand of the bramin was removed from the neck of the people, and the influence they once had will never again be felt
APPENDIX I
to a similar extent. The revenues of Tripetty are on a gradual decline and will die in the lapse of years a natural death. Some of the most celebrated temples in the country are worse off. But there are still, alas, many more strong holds of the devil.
For the correctness of all the above details I cannot answer as the temple or Devasthanam is not within the scope of my duties, although I have the revenue administration of the taluk in which Tripetty is. But to the best of my knowledge the information I have given is correct. It is derived from what I can collect in my office; but the natives in general are deplorably ignorant when you push them on such a subject or perhaps pretends to do so.&rdquo;
&ldquo;AUTHOR&rsquo;S OBSERVATIONS.&rdquo;
(The concluding portions of the above article plainly show that the British policy was to drive the brahmins out of the temple, to deprive temples of their landed property which were endowed by devotees for specific religious services, the ultimate aim being the complete ruination of all temples. This point is plainly told in the above article. It is plain now that the British Government resumed all the landed property of the Tirumalai Temple with a sinister motive. The Brahmin in spite of all the disadvantages created is still a devout servant of Hinduism and the revenues of the Tirumala temple mounted up from one lakh a year to about thirty five lakhs a year every pie of which comes from men of all classes and castes of Hindus).</li>
<li>The present revenue of the Temple has gone up to more than 10 crores a year.

APPENDIX II,
The under mentioned four inscriptions which have been numbered by the T.T.D. Epigraphist as No. 17, 18, 19 and 20 and which in the first Volume of the printed book of inscriptions bear the numbers 88, 8, 9, 19 (appearing on pages 119, 120; 12 to 17 and 28 to 31) were originally on the outer faces of the walls of the Koyil-alvär or garbhagriham before the latter was renovated by adding on another set of walls with covered faces. Copies of these inscriptions were taken under the orders of Vira Narasinga Yadavaraya before commencing the renovation work. After the completion of the renovation work and after the new first prakaram walls were constructed the inscriptions were re-engraved on the outer face of its north wall. The first inscription which is tacked on to the prasasti of Ko-Vira Raja Rajendra Panmar is the one marked No. 17 T.T. (or No. 88 in Vol. I). The second one is No. 18. T.T. (or No. 8 Vol. I); The third is No. 19 (or No. 9. Vol. 1). The fourth is No. 20 T. T. (No. 19 Vol. I).
The inscriptions are represented hereunder in the above order. It is stated in No. 17T. T. above that the re-engraving was completed on Friday combined with the asterism Uttirādam (or Uttiräshädha) being 22nd day of Chittirai month of the year of engraving. The Tamil word used to denote the year is our or this year, which is not the same thing as saying the year in which the order was issued for commencing the work (40th regnal year of Vira Narasinga) which would be 1244 A.D. arpisi month. month thereafter would not be in the same year. year before 1267 in which Friday, Uttiradam, and 22nd Chittirai would be concurrent. In 1250, Friday Uttiram and 22nd Chittirai are concurrent. Uttiradam seems to be incorrectly engraved for Uttiram.

HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
Ilis wife Samavai, the donor in these two epigraphs, was the daughter of a Pallavappergaḍaiyar, i.e., a Pallava chief. The similarity of names of this Kāḍava Saktivitańkan and Danti-Saktivitanki alias Lōkamahādēvi, one of the queens of Rajaraja, I, suggests a certain relationship between the two and evidences the existence of Pallava chiefs as Chōla subordinates, long after the extinction of Pallava rule at the end of the 9th century.
Here we come across the earliest instance of the consecration of metallic images, in this case a silver image, in the representation of the original idol of Sri Venkatesa, and the institution of special festivals and processions for these images twice a day for a period of seven days. These festivals were later on prolonged through twelve days and in many cases individual donors provided for the expenses of the processions and offerings on some of these days.

RAJENDRA-CHOLA I
No. 20-T.T. is dated on the 7th day, apparently in the first year, of the reign of Rajendra-Chōla I It embodies an order of the king&rsquo;s Adhikari named Koṛṛamangalamudaiyan who held an enquiry regarding the conduct of certain charities and services instituted in the temple of Sri Venkatesvara at Tirumala. The enquiry revealed that the charity of putting up lights in the temple, which the assembly of Tirumuṇḍiyam undertook to execute in pursuance of an earlier document engraved on stone, was being only partially carried out by them. The witnesses summoned to depose the facts were Kaḍappańkuḍaiyān designated Šiṛutanattuppanimakan who was the administrative officer of the sub-district of Kuḍavür-nāḍu (Kuḍavür-nāṭṭu vagai-şeygira siṛutanattuppanimakan) and the priests (pūjāris) or the servants of the temple (dévarkanmigal) The Adhikari was impressed with the negligence of the Sabhaiyar of Tirumuṇḍiyam and ordered that the original capital for this charity be recovered from them and credited to the general funds of the temple and the lamps lighted by the managers of the temple through the supply of the necessary ghee made from its stores.
This epigraph gives us a glimpse of the Chōla administrative system. The Adhikari was perhaps a governor placed over a province and, in this instance over the Jayankonda-Chola-maṇḍalam or Tondamandalam. During his itineracy through the country under his charge he took cognizance of all matters, both secular and religious, investigated them and derided them. There was an officer of a lower rank known as the Sirutanattuppaṇimakan, administering the nadu and he maintained a record of all transactions pertaining to his charge. An assembly hall existed in the temple at Tiruchchanur where the Adhikari held his court to which were
21
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
summoned the witnesses who had knowledge of the affairs enquired into.
The administrative divisions of the kingdom were the mandalams or provinces which were divided into kōṭṭams or districts; and these kōṭṭams were again sub-divided into nāḍus or sub-districts which comprised several kuṛrams formed of a number of villages grouped together. In consonance with this division of the kingdom, the hierarchy of officials must have consisted of the Adhikari over the mandalam, next in rank to him the Perutanattuppaṇimakan, over the kottam on the analogy of the siṛuttanattuppaṇimakan of the nadu and below the latter the officer in charge of the kūrṛam and lastly the headman of the single village.
No. 210-G. T., from Sri Kapilēsvara&rsquo;s temple at the foot of the hill near Tirupati, records that the central shrine of the temple was constructed by Rayan-Rajendra-Sōlan alias Brahmamārāyan-Munaiyadarayan who was the head of köttür at the time. The name indicates that he was an officer of RajendraChola I and administered the village of Köttür. No traces of this village are now possible, though we find it mentioned in three inscriptions of different dates. The first mention occurs in No. 19 T. T. belonging to the third quarter of the 10th century A.D., the second reference in No. 210-G.T. falling into the third quarter of the 11th century and the last in No. 355-G.T. dated in the second quarter of the 16th century during the reign of king Achyutaraya of Vijayanagara. From these references it appears that it must have been situated somewhere to the east of Tirupati and north of Tiruchanur and its boundaries must have extended towards Tiruchanur on the one side and the foot of the hill to the north of Tirupati on the other.

Hail, Prosperity&rsquo; On the 7th day in the reign of Sri Koppātrakēsarı-panmar alias Sri Rajendra Sōladeva, while Adhikari (governor) Korramangalamudaiyan enquired into the affairs of the temple from his seat in the assembly-hall built by us in Tiruchchukanur, a dévadānam of this God, in Kudavur-nāḍu, (a subdivision) of Tiuvenkatakōttam, (a district comprised in the division) of Perumbānappadi (in the province) of Jayankonda-Sōlamandalam having summoned Kadappankudaiyan the Siitanattuppanımakan (subordinate administrative officer) who administered the Kudavūrnādu, and the servants of Tiruvenkatadēvar, and called upon them to deposu as to the condition of the permanent daily provision (existing) for Tiruvenkatadevar, they stated that, as per the old document registered on stone, the Sabhaiyar of Tirumundiyam, a grant to this God, received money and undertook to light 24 lamps, including one light of camphor, but that the villagers of Tirumunḍıyam discontinued to burn all of them excepting two lights which they still burn
2 Thereupon Adhikari Kor amangalamudaiyan ordered that, with the 20 pon being the sum available at Tiruchchukanur and the 3 pon remaining in deposit in this deity s treasury (as remuneration) for the parichārakam service rendered by them to this God, aggregating to 23 pon, (the ghee) might be well-packed and transported to Tirumala along with the articles of daily provision and the servants working in this behalf might be enabled to burn (the lights) without any impediment

APPENDIX IV-(TO VOL. 1.)
Note on the probable date of birth of Vijayaditya Banaraya (See page 73).
From a connected reading of the following three inscriptions the probable date of birth of Vijayaditya Banaraya could be fixed approximately.
(1) The Tiruvallum Rock inscription in archaic Grantha in the 62nd regnal year of Nandi Vikrama Varman (Ep. Coll. 76 of 1899 and S. I. I. Vol. III, page 90).
(2) Ep. Coll. 226 of 1903 in Tamil in the Gudimallam Paramesvara Temple (Chittoor District) in the 49th year of Vijaya Danti Vikrama.
(3) Bana inscriptions in Gudimallam, Ep. Coll. 228 of 1907 in the Paramesvara Temple in the 24th year of Nrpatunga Varman.
The first one may be assigned to the year 772 A.D. Mävali Vanaraya was then ruling the Vaḍuguvali (twelve thousand) just three years before the death of Nandi Vikrama Varman. From the second one we learn that Vijayāditya was ruling in the 49th year of Danti Vikrama. This may be taken to be 823-24 A.D. The third inscription has to be assigned to the year 873 A.D. when Mavali Vanaraya was ruling the (west portion) of the Vaḍuguvali merku in the 24th year of Nrpatunga. The inference drawn from the above inscriptions is that Mavali Vijayaditya is the son of Mavali Vanaraya; and that Vijayaditya&rsquo;s son was also known as Mavali Vanarayar, which was his grand-father&rsquo;s name. The years before us are 772 A.D., 824 A.D. and 873 A.D. If it is assumed that Vijayaditya was born about 800 A.D. and his son about 840 A.D. the latter would have succeeded the former about 870 A.D. This assumption will give Vijayaditya seventy years of life which is not improbable. Vijayaditya&rsquo;s birth date would therefore have been between 790 and 800 A.D.

APPENDIX V-(TO VOL. I.)
English rendering of the relevant portion of the passage in the fifth adhyaya of Mausala parvam of Sri Mahabharatam.
(Translated from the Tamil translation by Vedanta Vibhushanam Karungulam Krishna Sastrigal and edited by Sri M. V Ramanujachariar Kesari Printing works. Madras).
&ldquo;&hellip;.He (Sri Krishna) who knew the Tatvas of all things and although He was the Deva (of all creation) decided on the manner of His departing from this Sarira (body) so as to discharge His function of sustaining all the three worlds and also to fulfil the Sāpam (curse) which Durvāsas had pronounced. So Krishna brought under control His Indriyas, speech and manas and lay down into a state of deep Yoga. It (therefore) happened that at that moment a cruel hearted hunter by name Jara who was desirous of bagging a beast sighted the spot where Krishna lay. Jara in his eagerness to have his prey mistook for a beast the Bhagavan who was lying in deep Yoga, and shot his sharp arrow which stuck into the sole of His foot. But when he approached to pick up his prey he found to his surprise that it was a human being with many hands clad in pitambara and concentrated in Yoga. Deeply regretting the huge blunder he had committed, he fell at the feet of Sri Krishna and craved for pardon. He was consoled by Sri Krishna in consideration of his birth and his avocation in this life. As a result of his having the good fortune of worshipping the mightiest dēva Krishna with contrition and bhakti he was freed from any future birth and taken by the devas to Svarga. Sri Vasudeva was then worshipped by all the gathered Munis and (the Spirit) ascended up the heavens with a glow which overspread the worlds. He was given a great ovation in the heavens by Indra, the Asvini devas, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, Visvedevas, Munis, Siddhas, the elite of Gandharvas and Apsaras. O Rajan, then Narayana the Bhagavan of dazzling tejas (splendour), who is the Creator, the Everlasting one, the Yogacharya, and Mahatma
29
HISTORY OF TIRUPATI
ascended to his place of immeasurable greatness, enveloping the earth and heavens with His brilliance. Then all the devas, rishis, charanas, gandharva sreshtas and great apsaras went near Krishna, worshipped and did puja. The devas welcomed His return with great exuberance. Munisreshtas did puja with (Vedic) Riks and gandharvas stood chanting praises. Indra approached with great love and devotion. Then the devas addressed Him O Bhagavan, who wields the bow Sarngam we do namaskaram to You repeatedly. You made Your avatar on earth to re-establish Dharma. All the enemies of the devas, such as Kamsa, have been killed and the earth has been lightened of its load of sin. If it is your pleasure to go back to that place which is Divyam (Divyaloka) where there is no old age, where there is limitless mahima and which is beyond our conception, except through the Vedas, in every Kalpa of time, do save the Jivas who are subject to the great disabilities of birth and death. Crowds of devas praised in this manner and as they retraced their steps showered flowers on His Form on which was Sri Devi also. O Rajan! As he entered the centre of the Sun, thence came forth Asariri väk (a voice from the heavens) &ldquo;O ye devas, worship ye this Form (which you behold) which has four hands, which is mighty with life, stiff and unchangeable and (which) is on earth. I will always dwell in this.&rdquo; Then all the devas headed by the Great Brahma unable to accompany Him to Paramapadam returned to their own worlds singing His praises with thoughtful devotion&rdquo;.
