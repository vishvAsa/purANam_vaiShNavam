The Astadasa Sarira Samskaras - A Vaikhanasa Outlook -Part 1(First 9 Samskaras)

## The Glory of Vēṅkaṭācala in Veda and Itihāsa

Before understanding the qualifications of the priest, one must understand the transcendent nature of the place. The Tirumala Hill (Vēṅkaṭācala) is not merely a geographical elevation but is celebrated in the Vedas and Itihāsas as the physical manifestation of Vaikuṇṭha on earth (Bhūloka Vaikuṇṭham).

The Rig Veda (10.155.1) is traditionally interpreted by Vaiṣṇava commentators as alluding to this holy hill in the verse:
“arāyi kāṇe vikaṭe giriṃ gaccha sadānve…”

Here, the devotee is directed to the great mountain to wash away misfortune (alakṣmī).

The Varāha Purāṇa and Bhaviṣyottara Purāṇa declare the hill’s supremacy with the famous śloka:

> “Vēṅkaṭādri samaṃ sthānaṃ brahmāṇḍe nāsti kiñcana |
Venkatesa samo devo na bhūto na bhaviṣyati ||”
>
> (“There is no place in the macrocosm equal to Venkatadri, and no God, past or future, equal to Venkateswara.”)

In the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva), the sages describe this region as the playground of the Celestials, where the boundary between the mortal and immortal worlds is thin. Since the Deity here is Svayamvyakta (Self-Manifested) and not installed by human hands, the sanctity of the shrine demands a priesthood that possesses an equally divine origin and constitution.

## The Archaka as ‘Viṣṇu’s Child’: The Necessity of Vaikhānasa Lineage
The governance of the Tirumala temple follows the Śrī Vaikhānasa Bhagavad‑śāstram. However, the choice of Vaikhānasa archakas for Śrī Venkateswara is purely a theological necessity rooted in the aṣṭādasa saṃskāras (18 bodily sacraments) described in the article below.

For a deity of such immense cosmic potency as Lord Venkateswara, the one who touches Him, bathes Him, and feeds Him cannot be an ordinary individual who achieves purity only through later education. The vessel must be pure from the moment of conception.

This is where the Vaikhānasa doctrine of Garbha-Vaiṣṇava-Siddhi becomes the defining qualification.

1. Garbha VaishnavaSiddhi (The Prenatal Samskāras)
  - As detailed in the exposition, a Vaikhānasa archaka is not "made" at the time of initiation; he is "consecrated" while still in the womb.
  * Through Niṣeka and Garbhādhāna, his very biological conception is an act of yajña offered to Nārāyaṇa.
  * Through Viṣṇubali, specifically, the fetus is fed the pāyasa (sacrificial food) of Viṣṇu in the eighth month of pregnancy.
  * The scriptural implication is profound: The body of the Vaikhānasa child is formed out of Viṣṇu-prasāda. Just as the Holy Pāyasa created the divine body of Rāma in the Rāmāyaṇa, the Viṣṇubali-havis creates a "divine body" for the archaka.
2. The Unbroken Fire (Jātakāgni to Aupāsana) - The Vaikhānasa priest does not approach the Lord with a purity acquired but with precise Vedic rituals. From Jātakarma (birth) to Upanayana (initiation), his life is sustained by a continuous thread of Vedic fire (Jātakāgni). He enters the sanctum not as a social being, but as a living Ahitāgni— a human embodiment of the Vedic fire sacrifice.

3. The Status of ‘Viṣṇoḥ Putraḥ’
  - Because of this rigorous prenatal and postnatal discipline, the Vaikhānasa Āgama regards the initiated Vaikhānasa not merely as a servant, but as Viṣṇoḥ Putraḥ (the Son of Vishnu).
  * In the logic of the Dharma Śāstras, a son has the natural right to touch the father, to bathe him, and to serve him intimately without bridging the rules of pollution.
  * Therefore, only the Vaikhānasa, who has undergone the Viṣṇubali and carries the impress of the Cakra on his spirit from the womb, has the adhikāra (authority) to touch the Mūlavirat of Sri Venkateswara from times immemorial as ordained by the presiding deity himself.

The adoration of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala is a dialogue between the Svayamvyakta Brahman (the Self-Manifest Deity) and the Saṃskṛta Ātman (the Refined Soul).

The Vaikhānasa archaka is chosen because his body has been processed by the aṣṭādasa saṃskāras to withstand and channel the intense spiritual energy of the Tirumala sanctum. When he stands before the Lord performing the Tomala Seva or Archana, it is not a meeting of strangers, but the service of a child who has belonged to Nārāyaṇa from the very moment of conception (Garbhādhāna) to the moment of service (Arcanam).

It is for this reason—the guarantee of absolute, Garbha Vaishnava Siddhi—that the Śrī Vaikhānasa Bhagavad‑śāstram remains the sole liturgical authority for the Kaliyuga Varada, Śrī Venkateswara Swami.

The Vaikhānasa tradition understands human life as a continuous yajña offered to Nārāyaṇa, from conception to marriage and beyond. Within this vision, the aṣṭādasa śarīra‑saṃskārās are not social ceremonies but a tightly structured Vedic–Vaiṣṇava discipline that shapes the body, mind and destiny of “Viṣnu’s child.” What follows is a synthetic exposition that can stand on its own as a scholarly article, combining the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra, Vaikhānasa Gṛhya‑sūtra‑Bhāṣya, and allied Vedic materials.

## Śrī Vaikhānasa Bhagavad‑śāstram, Vikhanasa Ṛṣi and his Śiṣyas

Within the Vaikhānasa community, the Kalpasūtra corpus— Śrauta, Gṛhya, Dharma and Pravara— is often simply called “Śrī Vaikhānasa Bhagavad‑śāstram”, on the understanding that its source is Bhagavān Nārāyaṇa teaching Vikhanasa Ṛṣi rather than a merely human author. The system is explicitly anchored in the Yajurveda and presents itself as an extension, not a replacement, of Vedic ritual.

The Vaikhānasa Āgama is a Vedic Vaiṣṇava system that traces its origin to the ṛṣi Vikhanasa, described in later texts either as an emanation of Brahmā or as a manifestation of Viṣṇu himself. The Vaikhānasa‑kalpasūtra—comprising Śrauta, Gṛhya, Dharma and Pravara sections—thus stands at the intersection of Śrauta Vedic ritual, gṛhya saṃskāras and Vaiṣṇava temple‑worship.

Bhagavan Vikhanasa is remembered as:

“समस्तवेदार्थविद्”– “the knower of the complete purport of the Vedas,” and as the Mahāguru who systematized both Śrauta and Smārta rites for those devoted exclusively to Nārāyaṇa.

From Vikhanasa’s teaching emerged the four principal Vaikhānasa sages— Atri, Bhṛgu, Kaśyapa and Marīci— through whom the tradition of temple‑worship (samūrtārcanā) and household rites spread. Later manuals regard these four as the primary preceptors regarding specific practical applications. Because of this pedigree, Vaikhānasa writers regularly assert that their texts are 'entirely Vedic in affiliation' and that the community represents a surviving school of Vedic ritual practice.

## Saṃskāras in Vedic and Vaikhānasa Perspective

### What are saṃskāras?

In the wider Vedic–Smṛti literature, saṃskāra designates a rite that “refines, consecrates or imprints” the individual, rendering the body and mind fit for dharma and ultimately for mokṣa. Dharma texts gloss saṃskāra as:

“संस्कारो हि नाम देहमनसां च शुद्धिः”– “Saṃskāra is the purification of the body and mind.”

Saṃskāras mark and sacralize key transitions—conception, embryo‑formation, birth, naming, first food, initiation, marriage, cremation—integrating them into the order of yajña.

### How many saṃskāras? Major sūtrakāra schemes

Across the early sūtra‑literature, several enumerations appear:

- Gautama Dharmasūtra: speaks of forty saṃskāras, including twelve bodily rites and twenty‑eight sacrificial observances (five Mahāyajñas, seven Pākayajñas, seven Haviryajñas, seven Soma‑yāgas).
- Āpastamba Gṛhya–Dharmasūtra: while aware of the broader Śrauta structure, practically foregrounds a core of around sixteen gṛhya‑saṃskāras from Garbhādhāna to Antyeṣṭi.
- Baudhāyana, Hiraṇyakeśin and others: preserve variant lists but in later digests are usually harmonized into the standard ṣoḍaśa‑saṃskāra schema.
- Smṛtis like Manu and Yājñavalkya: also highlight sixteen saṃskāras, typically starting with Garbhādhāna and ending with Antyeṣṭi, combining Vedic, gṛhya and purāṇic material.

The Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra is self‑conscious in positioning itself within this conversation: instead of simply adopting “ṣoḍaśa saṃskārāḥ,” it re‑articulates Gautama’s forty in a distinctively Vaiṣṇava way.

### Aṣṭādasa Śarīra‑Saṃskāras in Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra

Against this background, the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra speaks of eighteen śarīra‑saṃskārās, counting from Niṣeka to Pāṇigrahaṇa, and then adds twenty‑two yajñas, declaring:

> अष्टादश शरीरसंस्काराः …  
यज्ञाश्च द्वाविंशतिः …  
चत्वारिंशद् भवन्ति ।

> “Eighteen saṃskāras of the body … and twenty‑two yajñas … together they are forty.”  

In this way the Vaikhānasa school preserves the Gautamīya memory of forty sacraments (18 “bodily” + 22 sacrificial) while giving a markedly Vaiṣṇava inflection to their content.

The eighteen śarīra‑saṃskārās in the Vaikhānasa Gṛhya–Smārta tradition are:

1. Niṣeka / Ṛtusaṅgamana  
2. Garbhādhāna  
3. Puṃsavana  
4. Sīmanta‑unnayana  
5. Viṣṇubali  
6. Jātakarma  
7. Utthāna  
8. Nāmakaraṇa and Varṣavardhana (performed repeatedly on every recurrence of the birth‑nakṣatra)  
9. Annaprāśana  
10. Pravāsāgamana  
11. Piṇḍavardhana  
12. Cūḍā / Caula  
13. Upanayana  
14. Pārāyaṇa‑vrata‑bandha  
15. Visarga  
16. Upākarman  
17. Samāvartana
 18. Pāṇigrahaṇa.  

Distinctive points, relative to mainstream ṣoḍaśa‑saṃskāra lists, include:

- insertion of Ṛtusaṅgamana discipline and Viṣṇubali as separate prenatal rites,  
- the presence of Varṣavardhana, Pravāsāgamana and Piṇḍavardhana as distinct childhood samskāras, and  
- a strongly articulated Upākarman–Pārāyaṇa–Visarga cycle within Vedic study.  

The Vaikhānasa system thus places special weight on continuous bodily and ritual purification in a way that aligns with, yet also reconfigures, the older “forty‑samskāra” ideal.

## Commentarial Tradition and Śrī Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya Yājīn

Main commentaries on Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra

Several layers of commentary and exposition support the Kalpasūtra:

- Śrīnivāsamakhi Vedāntadeśika – produced a critical Sanskrit edition of the Vaikhānasa‑Gṛhya‑sūtram and Vaikhānasa‑Dharmasūtram with brief notes; this is the printed base text widely used today.
- Śrī Vaikhānasa Sūtra‑Darpaṇam (Telugu) – an extensive vernacular explanation of all four sūtra‑branches, used in teaching and ritual training.  

Most influential within the living tradition, however, is the full Bhāṣya of Śrī Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya Yājīn.

Śrī Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya Yājīn: interpreter of the Bhagavad‑śāstram

Śrī Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya Yājīn belongs to a traditional Vājapeya‑performing Vaikhānasa family, hence the epithet “Vājapeya Yājīn.” His exhaustive Sanskrit Bhāṣya on the Gṛhya‑ and Dharma‑portions is cited in colophons as:

“इति श्री नृसिंह वाजपेय याजीये श्री वैखानस सूत्रभाष्ये …”**  

and has become the de facto standard within the Vaikhānasa community.

His commentary is marked by:

- Wide śāstric citation – Yājñavalkya, Bṛhaspati, Pāraskara, Laugākṣi, Sāṅkhyāyana and others are regularly quoted to contextualize Vaikhānasa practice within broader Śrauta–Gṛhya consensus.  
- Integration of allied disciplines – jyotiṣa (for Jātakarma and Varṣavardhana), āyurveda (dhātus, herbs, obstetric signs), and purāṇic Vaiṣṇava theology (Viṣṇu, Lakṣmī, avatāra‑doctrine) are woven into one interpretive fabric.  
- Precise prayoga – beyond mantras, he details the physical handling of fire, araṇis, ladles, grains, pāyasa, the seating of wife and child, making the Bhāṣya also a practical manual for contemporary archaka families.  

Because of this, his work now functions much like an “official scholastic voice” of the Vaikhānasa tradition, and it is primarily through his lens that the aṣṭādasa saṃskāras are read here.

## Superiority and Vedic Affiliation of Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra

Unlike many later Āgamas that stand alongside the Veda, the Vaikhānasa tradition insists that its Kalpasūtra is an integral part of the Vedic corpus. Modern summaries emphasize that:

- the Vaikhānasa community belongs to the Yajurveda and has “retained common customs and traditions” directly from that school;
- the Kalpasūtra’s Śrauta portion conducts full Somayāgas and Agnyādheya; its Gṛhya portion prescribes saṃskāras that are explicitly Vedic in mantras and homa‑structure;
 ⁃ Temple worship is framed as 'Yajña‑puruṣa‑upāsanā'—a practice that combines Vedic fire sacrifices with the worship of Vishnu’s idol, without discarding the original fire rituals.

This dual fidelity—to Śruti and mūrti‑arcana—makes Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra a uniquely bridging text between the world of the Brāhmaṇas and that of the Āgamas, and underlies its claim to superiority over purely Smārta or purely Tantric manuals.

A final feature that stands out is the consistent embedding of Gṛhya saṃskāras within explicit Vedic procedure:

- Every major rite— Niṣeka, Garbhādhāna, Puṃsavana, Sīmanta, Viṣṇubali, Jātakarma, Utthāna, Nāmakaraṇa, Varṣavardhana—begins with āghāra, avahana, jushtakara+++(=सूर्याय जुष्टं निर्वपामीत्यादि??)+++, svahakara and homa up to Svīṣṭakṛt, exactly as in Śrauta contexts, but adapted to gṛhya‑fires.  
- Use of Vyāhṛtis (oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ), Puruṣa‑mantras, lunar and Soma‑verses, and full nakṣatra–devatā lists shows a deliberate effort to keep the entire saṃskāra‑chain inside the Vedic sound‑universe, not merely in later Smṛti formulae.  
- Even seemingly “domestic” acts (naming, annual birthday, first outing) are framed by fire‑oblation, Brāhmaṇa‑feeding and mantric recitation; there is no purely social ceremony.  

The Vaikhānasa aṣṭādasa saṃskāras can therefore be described as “Vedicized life‑cycle rites”, preserving a level of scriptural and liturgical density that many later traditions have simplified.

## Garbha‑Vaiṣṇava‑siddhi in Vaikhānasa Thought

Taken together, Ṛtusaṅgamana, Garbhādhāna, Puṃsavana, Sīmanta and especially Viṣṇubali effect what may be called “garbha‑vaiṣṇava‑siddhi”—the accomplishment of Vaiṣṇava identity already in the womb. Garbhādhāna describes the fetus as “दैवानुगुप्तं” (daivānugupta), divinely guarded. Viṣṇubali’s saṃkalpa names its goal as “गर्भरक्षार्थं” (garbha‑rakṣārtham), and the Bhāṣya tradition further interprets the rite as impressing Viṣṇu’s cakra and nāma upon the unborn child. When the mother eats the pāyasa that has been first offered through Agni to Viṣṇu in his twelve forms, the fetus is thought to be inwardly nourished by Viṣṇu‑prasāda.

Later Vaikhānasa authors, reflecting on these rites, speak of such a child as “Viṣṇu’s own” (viṣṇoḥ putraḥ) and hold that only those who have undergone these prenatal saṃskāras (especially Viṣṇubali) within hereditary Vaikhānasa lineages fully qualify as archakas in Vaikhanasa Viṣṇu temples. In this sense, garbha‑vaiṣṇava‑siddhi is not just individual piety but a principle of community identity and temple authority, anchored in the Kalpasūtra’s saṃskāra theory.

## The First Nine Saṃskāras in Detail

What follows is a detailed exposition of the first nine śarīra‑saṃskāras, with extensive citation of the Vaikhānasa Gṛhya‑sūtra and Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya’s Bhāṣya, and with emphasis on their Vedic and Vaiṣṇava affiliations.

### 1. Niṣeka – Sacralized Conception

Niṣeka is the first of the aṣṭādasa śarīra‑saṃskāras and is treated as a fully liturgical act that sacralizes conception. The Gṛhya‑sūtra introduces it succinctly:

निषेकः।  
ततोऽपरस्यां रात्रा चतुर्थ्यां मलं कृत्योऽग्निमुपसमाधाय नवप्रायश्चित्तानि जुहुयात् ॥ २४ ॥
niṣekaḥ. tato ’parasyāṃ rātrā caturthyāṃ malaṃ kṛtyo ’gnim upasamādhāya nava‑prāyaścittāni juhuyāt.

“[Next comes] Niṣeka. Then, on another night, on the fourth, having performed the cleansing and established the fire, he should offer nine expiatory oblations.”

The Bhāṣya explains:

त्रिरात्रानन्तरं चतुर्थ्यां रात्र्यपरस्याम् … मलं कृत्य पत्नीमात्मानं वस्त्र‑गन्ध‑माल्यादैर्विभूष्य पत्न्या सह प्राङ्गणमुपेत्य ‘निषेककर्म करिष्ये’ इति संकल्प्य, अग्निमुपासनमुपसमाधाय परिसमूह्य परिषिच्य अस्मिन्नग्नौ नव प्रायश्चित्तानि व्याहृतिपर्यन्तं जुहुयात् ।

“After three nights, on the fourth night, having performed the prescribed cleansing, having adorned his wife and himself with garments, fragrance and garlands, he should go together with his wife into the courtyard and, making the resolve ‘I shall perform the Niṣeka‑rite,’ worship and establish the fire, surround it and sprinkle it, and into this fire offer the nine expiatory oblations with mantras up to the Vyāhṛtis.”

Niṣeka is thus a full gṛhya‑homa following the Yajurvedic āghāra–agnidhyanam–jushtakara, svahakara–Svīṣṭakṛt pattern. The nine prāyaścitta‑homas cleanse any ritual faults in the couple before conception, ensuring that the very beginning of embodied life enters under the auspice of Agni and Nārāyaṇa rather than merely biological impulse.

Within the aṣṭādasa‑saṃskāra chain, Niṣeka is the initial moment at which the body‑to‑be is drawn into yajña; later prenatal rites will refine what Niṣeka inaugurates.

### 2. Ṛtusaṅgamana – Menstrual Vrata and Womb‑Preparation

Ṛtusaṅgamana is the preparatory discipline governing the ṛtu‑kāla (season of menstruation) immediately surrounding Niṣeka. The Gṛhya‑sūtra states:

ऋतुसङ्गमनम्।  

अथ त्रिरात्रमृतौ मलवद्वासा स्नानाञ्जनादीनि वर्जयेत् ॥ २९ ॥


Further rules:

एकभक्ता स्यात् ॥ ३० ॥ – She eats only once daily.  
खर्वेणाञ्जलिना आयसेन वा पिबेत् ॥ ३१ ॥ – She drinks only from a simple vessel, cupped hands or metal cup.  
न ग्रहान्नीक्षेत। न दिवा स्वप्येत। … यथोक्तं व्रतं कुर्यात् ॥ ३३–३५ ॥

On the fourth day:  
चतुर्थ्यां दन्तधावनं गन्धामलकादिभिः  
स्नात्वा श्वेतवस्त्रानुलेपना … परमदृष्ट्वैव भर्तारं पश्येत् ॥ ३६ ॥  

and because:

यस्मादृतुस्नाता यादृशं पुरुषं पश्येत्तादृशी प्रजा भवति ॥ ३७ ॥

“As the ṛtusnāta woman sees such‑and‑such a man, such‑like will be the offspring.” 

Hence she must see only her husband.+++(4)+++

Before approach:

तत एनां यव्यैरद्भिः प्रोक्ष्य  
तैः प्रोक्ष्य  
‘विष्णुर्योनिं कल्पयतु’ इति तामुपगच्छेत् ॥ ४६ ॥

“Sprinkling her with barley‑water, he should approach her (saying) ‘May Viṣṇu prepare the womb’ (viṣṇur yonim kalpayatu).”

Ṛtusaṅgamana is thus both ascetic vrata and Vaiṣṇava invocation: menstruation is acknowledged as a liminal process, followed by a consciously Viṣṇu‑oriented approach to conception.

### 3. Garbhādhāna – Consecration of Recognized Pregnancy

Garbhādhāna in Vaikhānasa is the first explicit saṃskāra after conception is recognized.

The section opens:

अथ गृहीतगर्भलिङ्गानि ॥ ४८ ॥
atha gṛhīta‑garbha‑liṅgāni.

“Now, the signs of a received pregnancy.”  

Sūtra:

शरीरादवस्रंसि सदनं दैन्यं भर्तुश्च तद्वदपरोदां प्रकोपगं भरतानुभरणं योनैः ॥ ४९ ॥

The Bhāṣya parses this as slackness of body, drooping limbs, dejection, change in attitude toward husband, altered cravings, salivation, loss of strength, hair‑line on the belly and throbbing in the womb—these are gṛhīta‑garbha‑liṅgāni.

Once such signs appear, the rite is scheduled:

गर्भस्य दैवानुगुप्तं ज्ञात्वाऽपूर्यमाण पक्षे पुण्ये पुन्नाम्नि शुभे नक्षत्रे आग्नेयमाघारं हुत्वा तां मलङ्कृत्य मुपवेश्य परिषिच्य धातादि पञ्चवारुणं मूलहोमं स्विष्टकृतं च हुत्वा ‘हैमीं’ इति यवान् ददाति ॥ १०० ॥

“Having known that the fetus is divinely guarded (daivānugupta), in the waxing fortnight, under an auspicious male‑named star, offering the āghāra in the fire, adorning her, seating her, sprinkling her, he should offer the five Varuṇa‑oblations beginning with Dhātṛ, the basic homa and Svīṣṭakṛt, and give barley (or rice) with the haimī mantra.”

Then:

> पयो दधि घृतं समं गृहीतं त्रिवृदित्यमानन्ति ॥ १०१ ॥  
> ‘भूस्त्वयि दधामि’ इत्येनां त्रिवृतं प्राशयेत् ॥ १०२ ॥

“Milk, curds and ghee, taken in equal measure, are called ‘trivṛt’; with ‘Bhūḥ, on thee I place [this]’ he should cause her to eat the trivṛt.”

The rite ends with:

आचान्ताया नाभे ऊर्ध्वं … दर्भेण त्रिरुन्मार्ष्टि, प्रदक्षिणं कुर्यात् ॥ १०३ ॥  
> ब्राह्मणान् पित्र्येन तर्पयति ॥ १०४ ॥

Touching above the navel with darbha and feeding Brāhmaṇas.

Garbhādhāna thus publicly seals and blesses a pregnancy already granted by Viṣṇu, aligning the fetus with Dhātṛ–Varuṇa and nourishing it with trivṛt, under the oversight of Agni and the Brāhmaṇa‑community.

### 4. Puṃsavana – Fetal Strengthening under Soma and Rākā

Puṃsavana is the next prenatal saṃskāra, intended to strengthen and protect the developing fetus.

Sūtra:

अथ गर्भाधानादि चतुर्थे मासि पुंसवनं भवति ॥ १०५ ॥

“After Garbhādhāna, in the fourth month, Puṃsavana takes place.”

Bhāṣya cites authorities:

गर्भस्य स्पन्दनात् पूर्वमिति याज्ञवल्क्यः; गर्भस्य स्पन्दने तरकालम् इति बृहस्पतिः; द्वितीये तृतीये वा मासीति पारस्करः ॥

Vaikhānasa norm remains around the 4th month.

The homa‑framework:

शुक्लपक्षे शुद्धेऽहनि … ‘एनां पुंसवनकर्मणा संस्करिष्ये’ इति सङ्कल्प्य … पूर्ववद् अग्निमुपसमाधाय … स्विष्टकृदन्तं हुत्वा… ॥ १०६ ॥

Then the specific act:

दक्षिणतोऽग्नेरपरामासीनायै ‘वृषोऽसि’ इति सर्वं मिश्रितान् यवान् ‘अन्नं प्राण’ इति दद्यात् ॥ १०६ ॥  
अलाभे माषधान्यौ प्रतिनिधि स्याताम् ॥ १०७ ॥

“To the south of the fire, for the pregnant woman sitting there, he should place mixed barley‑grains in her hand with ‘vṛṣo’si’ (‘thou art a bull’) and give them with ‘annaṃ prāṇa’; in absence of barley, pulses are substitutes.”

Then:

‘ओं भूर्भुवस्सुवः, राकामहं, यास्ते राके, सोम एव, विश्वा उतत्वया’ इत्युदरमभिमृशेत् ॥ १०८ ॥

He touches the belly with Vyāhṛtis and Rākā–Soma verses, aligning fetal growth with full‑moon Somaic nourishment. As in Garbhādhāna:

पूर्ववत् त्रिवृत्प्राशनादीनीति विजायते ॥ १०९ ॥

The same trivṛt‑feeding and puṇyāha close the rite.

Puṃsavana, within the prenatal arc, is thus Vedic in mantras, nutritive in content and Vaiṣṇava in ultimate orientation, preparing the fetus for Sīmanta and Viṣṇubali.

### 5. Sīmanta‑unnayana – Raising the Fetus toward Birth

Sīmanta is the late‑pregnancy saṃskāra, aimed at elevating and protecting mother and fetus.

Sūtra:

अथ गर्भाधानादष्टमे मासि सीमन्तोन्नयनं कुर्यात् ॥ ११० ॥

“After Garbhādhāna, in the eighth month, one should perform Sīmanta‑unnayana.”

After discussing variants (Laugākṣi, Sāṅkhyāyana, Yājñavalkya), the text prescribes:

… तस्मिन् दिने पूर्वाह्णे पत्न्या सह प्राङ्गणमुपेत्य ‘एनां सीमन्तेन कर्मणा संस्करिष्ये’ इति संकल्प्य ।

The homa parallels Garbhādhāna and Puṃsavana (Dhātā etc., Svīṣṭakṛt). Then comes the characteristic gesture:

पूर्ववद्धातादि हुत्वा त्रेधा शलात्यसह शलाटुग्लप्सं साग्रपत्रं कुशाङ्कुरं च दर्भेण त्रिराबध्य ‘ओं भूर्भुवस्सुवः’ इति गृहीत्वा तस्यास्तदासीनायास सगन्धपत्या सीमन्ते ‘राकामहग्ं, यास्ते राके’ इति स्थापयितोन्नयनं कुर्यात् ॥ ११२ ॥

He binds three things—śalātī/śalāṭu‑fruit, glapsa‑leaf with its tip, and a kuśa‑sprout—three times with darbha, holds this bundle with the Vyāhṛtis, and raises it along the hair‑parting (sīmanta) of the fragrant, garlanded pregnant woman, reciting Rākā‑verses. The Bhāṣya interprets this as literally “unnayana”—lifting the fetal life along the “path” of the sīmanta, away from danger toward full lunar maturity.

Sūtra ११३–११४ indicate Soma‑touch and trivṛt again; thus Sīmanta repeats and crowns the earlier prenatal structure.

### 6. Viṣṇubali – Prenatal Consecration to Viṣṇu (and the Daśaratha Pāyasa Parallel)

Viṣṇubali is the distinctively Vaikhānasa prenatal saṃskāra, completing the womb‑rites.

Sūtra:

अथ विष्णुबलिः ॥ ११५ ॥ 

specifies:

… गर्भाधानाद्यष्टमे मास्येव शुक्लपक्षे शुभेऽहनि कर्तव्यं अस्याः गर्भरक्षार्थं विष्णुबलिं करिष्य इति सङ्कल्प्य… ॥

“In the eighth month after Garbhādhāna, in the bright fortnight on an auspicious day, with the resolve ‘For the protection of this fetus I shall perform Viṣṇubali’.”

After āghāra, the sacrificer invokes Puruṣa:

उत्तरप्रदेशेऽग्न्यधिदैवान् ‘ओं भूः पुरुषं, ओं भुवः पुरुषं, ओं सुवः पुरुषं, ओं भूर्भुवस्सुवः पुरुषं’ च इत्यावाह्य… ॥ ११६ ॥

Then establishes a sthāṇḍila east of the fire and darbha‑seats, upon which the twelve forms of Viṣṇu are invoked:

… दर्भासनेषु ‘केशवं, नारायणं, माधवं, गोविन्दं, विष्णुं, मधुसूदनं, त्रिविक्रमं, वामनं, श्रीधरं, हृषीकेशं, पद्मनाभं, दामोदरं’ इति नामभिर्दैवं विष्णुमावाह्य … तत्तन्नाम्नाऽर्चयति ॥ ११६ ॥

The Bhāṣya notes sixteen upacāras with each nāma.

Then 12 ājya‑homas:

अतो देवाद्यैः विष्णोर्नुकं, तदस्य प्रियम, प्र तद्विष्णुः परो मात्रया विचक्रमे, त्रिर्देव इति द्वादशाहुतीराज्येन हुत्वा… ॥ ११७ ॥

“With the Ṛg‑verses beginning ‘ato devāḥ…’ (we shall now sing of Viṣṇu; this is his beloved domain; he has traversed with three strides), he offers twelve ājya‑oblations.”

Then pāyasa:

… पायसमाज्यसंयुक्तं हविरेव निवेद्य द्वादशनामभिः अतो देवाद्यैर्विष्णोर्नुकद्यैराज्यमिश्रं पायसं जुहुयात् ।

He offers sweet rice mixed with ghee as havis; after naivedya, a portion of that pāyasa is offered into the fire with the same Viṣṇu‑praising mantras and twelve names. Finally:

ऋग्यजुस्सामर्वभिर्नवैर्नैवेद्यशेषं पत्न्यै प्राशयति ॥ ११८ ॥

“With nine mantras from Ṛg, Yajus and Sāman he praises the deity and causes the wife to eat the naivedya‑śeṣa.”

Here Viṣṇubali clearly mirrors the putrakāmeṣṭi scenario in the Rāmāyaṇa: in Vālmīki’s account, after Daśaratha’s śrauta‑yajña, Agni emerges bearing pāyasa sent by Viṣṇu, which the queens eat and thereby conceive Rāma and his brothers. In both cases:

- pāyasa is Viṣṇu’s prasāda mediated by Agni,  
- it is eaten by women who will bear specially protected sons,  
- Ṛgvedic praise‑verses to Viṣṇu form the liturgical core.

The difference is that Putrakāmeṣṭi is a public royal vowed yajña, whereas Viṣṇubali is a hereditary domestic saṃskāra repeated in Vaikhānasa lineages. Structurally and theologically, however, Viṣṇubali is best understood as the domesticated, regularly transmitted form of the same logic that underlies Daśaratha’s pāyasa: Viṣṇu himself “enters” the womb through consecrated food. This is the heart of garbha‑vaiṣṇava‑siddhi.

### 7. Jātakarma – Birth‑Rite, Obstetrics and Jyotiṣa

The Jātakarma section begins:

अथ जातकर्म व्याख्यास्यामः ॥ ११९ ॥  
atha jātakarma vyākhyāsyāmaḥ.

It lays down rules for the ariṣṭāgāra(sūtikā‑gṛha), fumigation with sesame and mustard, presence of cows and bulls, midwives (tad‑jñāḥ striyaḥ), and herbal support for difficult labour:

गर्भसङ्गे विशल्यां सुवर्चलां वा योनौ निषिध्य निदध्यात् ॥ १२३ ॥  
धूपयेत्पिण्डीतकेनाहिकृत्वा वा योनिम् ॥ १२४ ॥  
हिरण्यपुष्प्या मूलं हस्तपादयोरादधाति ॥ १२५ ॥

A distinctive Vaikhānasa feature is the explicit astrological moment:

यवन्नासाग्रं दृश्येत तस्य ग्रहस्थितिं ज्ञात्वा शुभाशुभं परीक्षेत ॥ १२६ ॥  
> यस्मात्तद्दूषण्यन्तं वर्धयेत् ॥ १२७ ॥

“As soon as the nose‑tip is visible, he should know the graha‑positions and examine auspicious and inauspicious factors; from that he should foster what is good and counteract what is defective.” Thus jyotiṣa is integrated into the saṃskāra itself.

Other details:

जायमाने मातुरुदकुम्भं दक्षिणतः शिरोभागे स्थापयेत् ॥ १२८ ॥  
ततस्तूर्यस्वन्तिं पादतो निधाय ‘यधैव सोमः पवते’ इत्युदरमभिमृशेत् ॥ १२९ ॥

A water‑pot is placed near the mother’s head; instruments are set at her feet; the husband touches the belly reciting “yathaiva somaḥ pavate”—a Soma‑pavate ṛk linking birth to purifying Soma‑flow. When a boy is born:

कुमारे जाते द्वार वामौश्यानि परशुं तन्हिरण्यं स्थापयित्वा ‘अश्माभव’ इत्यधरमुत्तरं करोति ॥ १३० ॥

Stones, axe and gold are placed at the doorway; the “aśmā bhava” mantra wishes the boy firmness like stone.

Vaikhānasa Jātakarma thus spans from obstetrics and jyotiṣa to Ṛgvedic Soma‑hymns, making the threshold between womb and world explicitly Vedic and Vaiṣṇava.

### 8. Utthāna – Re‑Entry into the Sacrificial Household

Utthāna marks the child’s ritual “raising” from the seclusion of birth into the normal sacrificial life.

Sūtra:

> अथ दशमे द्वादशे वाह्नि भवत्युत्थानम् ॥ १४० ॥  
> “On the tenth or twelfth day Utthāna takes place.”

A key Vaikhānasa feature is the jātakāgni:

> तदैव जातकाग्निं समारोप्य  
> यावत् सुतस्य कर्माणि  
> तानि सर्वाणि मथित्वास्मिन्न् एव कुर्यात् ॥ १४१ ॥

> “Having again established the jātaka‑fire, all the son’s rites should, kindling it, be done in this very fire.” 

The Bhāṣya connects this to Śrauta prescriptions that fires, once kindled, are to be preserved and churned at need; from Jātakarma through Upanayana the child’s life remains linked to a single line of Agni.

After house‑purification:

स्नात्वाऽगारं यथोक्तं शोधयेत् ॥ १४३ ॥  
क्षुरकर्मादिना शुद्धो भूमियज्ञं सगोत्रेण याजयेदित्येके ॥ १४४ ॥

The ritual agents bathe; with tonsure and full bath completed, some authorities say he should perform Bhūmiyajña (a Vāstu‑homa) with a Brāhmaṇa of the same gotra.

Core sacrificial content:

धातादि पञ्चवारुणं मूलहोमो भोजनं ब्राह्मणानाम् ॥ १४६ ॥

“As Utthāna there are the five Varuṇa‑oblations beginning with Dhātṛ, the basic homa, and feeding of Brāhmaṇas.”

Utthāna thus re‑integrates the household and its fires after birth and publicly inserts the child into the same Dhātṛ–Varuṇa network of order and protection that framed Garbhādhāna.

Jātakarma–Utthāna are closely linked with a special sacrificial fire, and there is a conceptual continuity of that fire up to the boy’s Upanayana and Veda‑study, even if the technical handling is nuanced.

#### Jātakarma, Utthāna and the “child’s fire”

In the Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra, Jātakarma and Utthāna are performed not in the great śrauta fires, but in a domestic ritual fire distinct from the permanent aupāsana/śrāmaṇaka‑agni. A general Gṛhya rule often cited (also reflected in later prayogas) runs in this form:
 
> caula‑jātaka‑godāna‑snānopanayana‑vrate lājahome samitkārye laukikāgnir vidhīyate –
> 
> “For Caula, Jātaka, Godāna, ceremonial bath, Upanayana, vows, and for lājahoma and samidh‑offerings, a separate (worldly) ritual fire is prescribed.”

Within the Vaikhānasa framework this is interpreted in Bhāṣya fashion as:

 At Jātakarma–Utthāna, the father establishes a fresh ritual fire (through agnimukha) specifically for the child’s saṃskāras, performs the homa‑portion of the rite, and then preserves this sacrificial continuity as part of his own household fires.

The fire is not literally kept as a separate, visible flame for years in all cases, but is treated as a continuation of the sacrificial line that began at the child’s birth; when later child‑rites (Annaprāśana, Caula, Upanayana) are done, the same “child‑fire” is conceptually “revived” through the standard agnir upasamādhāna sequence, so that all these rites belong to one and the same ritual current.
 
> jātakarma‑kāle navaṃ vahnim upasamādadhāti, tenaiva bālakasya sarvakarmāṇi pratisaṃdhatte –  
> “At the time of Jātakarma he establishes a new fire, and by that very fire he links together all rites of the child.”

So a special fire is kindled “for” the child at birth and that the father, as yajamāna, bears responsibility for that line of fire until Upanayana – is quite faithful to the Gṛhyasūtra‑Bhāṣya ethos, even if in practice the same physical hearth is shared.

#### Transmission at Upanayana
By the time of Upanayana, the Vaikhānasa boy is to be made capable of tending fire and offering samidh‑homas himself. A typical instruction in the Gṛhyasūtra for Upanayana contains two key ideas:
1. The guru (often the father himself in Vaikhānasa practice) brings the boy near the fire and has him perform the first small offerings:  
   agnim upasamādhāya, brahmacāriṇam agnaye samidho juhoti – “Having established the fire, he has the brahmacārin offer samidh to Agni.”
2. The Bhāṣya glosses this as a kind of “handing over” of the sacrificial responsibility that has rested with the father since Jātakarma:
  - yāvat putrasya nāsīt saṃskāro,  
    tāvat sarvakarmasu pitāgninā caret;  
    upanayanāt tu svayaṃ bālaka eva svāgnau karmāṇi kurvīta –  
   “Until the son had (initiation) as saṃskāra, the father carried out all rites by his own fire; from Upanayana onward, the boy himself should perform his rites in his own fire.”

In other words:

- The “child’s fire” is first lit by the father at Jātakarma–Utthāna, and all child‑saṃskāras up to Upanayana are notionally performed in that line of fire under the father’s guardianship.
- At Upanayana, that same sacrificial line is ritually transferred: by making the boy offer samidh and perform his first homa, the father/guru effectively entrusts the fire to the child, who now becomes āhitāgni in miniature, responsible for his own nitya‑karmas and Veda‑study.

Vaikhānasa Gṛhyasūtra‑Bhāṣya treats the “child’s fire” as a continuous sacrificial line from Jātakarma–Utthāna up to Upanayana, and explains both rites in explicitly theological terms rather than only as technical fire‑rules. 

In summary,
At Jātakarma–Utthāna: inaugurating the child’s fire

The sūtra prescribes that Jātakarma and Utthāna be done with a specially prepared ritual fire. The Bhāṣya explains this roughly as follows:

> “At the time of Jātakarma, the father establishes a new fire with due rites (agnim upasamādhāya). This fire is not merely for that one act; it is to be regarded as the child’s sacrificial fire.”

> “Why a new fire? Because a new life has appeared. Just as a new yajamāna would kindle a new fire, so the father, acting on behalf of the son, kindles Agni as the witness of the child’s birth and of all future rites to come.”

On Utthāna, where the child is ritually “raised up,” the Bhāṣya links the act directly to this fire:

> “Raising the child in front of this same Agni signifies that the life which has now emerged into the world is placed under the guardianship of the sacrificial fire. From now on, whatever saṃskāra is performed for the child is to be connected (pratisaṃdhāna) to this Agni.”

In concise doctrinal language, the commentator’s point is:

- Until Upanayana, the father is the visible yajamāna, and the child is a beneficiary.
- The Agni lit at Jātakarma–Utthāna becomes the carrier of the child’s destiny, silently joining all subsequent rites—Annaprāśana, Pravāsāgamana, Piṇḍavardhana, Caula—into a single continuous yajña‑stream.

#### At Upanayana: transferring sacrificial responsibility
When the boy reaches the age for Upanayana, the Gṛhyasūtra again prescribes agnim upasamādhāyaand samidh‑offerings. The Bhāṣya uses this to describe a transfer:
 
> “So long as the son was without initiation, the father alone acted in Agni, and the son’s rites were performed in the father’s fire.”
> “At Upanayana, by placing the boy before the fire and making him offer samidh with his own hand, the father hands over the course of that Agni to the son. From this point onward, the son is to be counted among those who ‘maintain fire’ and who have a right to sacrifice.”

The Bhāṣya glosses the boy’s first offering in this spirit:

 The act of the guru/father taking the boy’s hand and guiding the samidh into Agni is said to mean:

> “The same Agni in whose presence you were born, raised, nourished, and sanctified by your father’s rites, now accepts you as his own sacrificer. What your father did on your behalf, you must now do yourself.” 

Hence two clear doctrinal points:

1. Continuity: the fire at Upanayana is not a different sacrificial reality; it is the ritual continuation of the Agni kindled at Jātakarma–Utthāna. The Bhāṣya explicitly uses words like pratisaṃdhatte (“he links [the rites] together by this same fire”).
2. Transfer of adhikāra: the moment the boy performs his first samidh‑homa, he passes from being “one for whom the father does sacrifice” to being “one who himself has adhikāra in Nārāyaṇa’s yajña.” The father, having guarded the child’s fire up to this point, now entrusts it to him as part of his brahmacarya‑vrata. 

### 9. Nāmakaraṇa and Varṣavardhana – Naming and Annual Star‑Rite

Nāmakaraṇa completes the earliest post‑natal sequence (Jātakarma–Utthāna–Nāmakaraṇa) by fixing the child’s identity in gotra, devatā and time.

The section opens:

अथ नामकरणम् ॥ १४७ ॥

A timing sūtra:

आचत्वारिंशद्दिवसा दापञ्चाशद्दिनाद्वा प्राङ्नाम्नि नियुञ्जीत ॥ १४८ ॥

“Before the 44th day (for a boy) or before the 55th (for a girl) one should not employ (the child) with a name.”

The main ritual prescription:

अतैव शुभे पुन्नाम्नि नक्षत्रे परिस्तीर्यग्निं तद्दक्षिणतः स्थितं कुमारस्य मूर्ध्नि विन्यस्य पञ्चवारुणं प्राजापत्यं स्विष्टकृतं च हुत्वा पूर्ववत् त्रिवृत्प्राशनम् ॥ १४९ ॥

“On an auspicious day, under a ‘male‑named’ constellation, having spread the fire, standing to its south, placing (akṣata etc.) on the boy’s head, he should offer the pañca‑Vāruna, Prajāpatya and Svīṣṭakṛt, and, as before, perform the trivṛt‑feeding.”

On the form of the name:

दीर्घांतमभिनिष्टांतं वा घोषवदाद्यं अन्तरं द्विःप्रतिष्ठितं स्रस्तं मुष्टाक्षर पदस्वरं द्वयक्षं चतुरक्षरं वा नाम शस्यते कुमारस्य ॥ १५० ॥

The Bhāṣya unpacks this into phonetic requirements: final long vowel, sonant beginning, properly placed semivowels/nasals, full “fist‑syllable,” ideally two or four syllables. For girls, lighter names (asamaksara) are preferred. Names of devatās are praised as best; human names middling; rivers/trees lowest.

Two names:

द्वे नामनी तु नक्षत्रनाम रहस्यं अग्न्यधानात्परं माहिताग्न्यादि स्वकर्मान्तं प्रकाशं नाम भवेत् ॥ १५२ ॥

“There are two names: a constellation‑name, secret; and, after Agnyādheya etc., a public name lasting until the end of his own rites.” The nakṣatra‑nāma is used in mantra and saṃkalpa; the vyavahāra‑nāma is the social name, often combined with gotra and the suffix “śarmā” (e.g. “Śrī Nṛsiṃhaśarmā Bhāradvājaḥ”).

The rite ends with auspicious sprinkling:

अक्षतोदकपुष्पान्नरसगन्धनमैः पाणिभ्यां दक्षिणेतराभ्यां कुमारस्य … इति वदन् … शिरसि च निक्षिपेत् ॥ १५३ ॥

Unbroken rice, water, flowers, cooked food, essences and fragrance are placed on the child’s body and head while reciting blessing‑formulae.

Varṣavardhana is closely allied but not identical. It is not a one‑time saṃskāra but a recurring rite performed whenever the birth‑nakṣatra returns each year.

Sūtra:

अथ वर्षवर्धनम् ॥ १५५ ॥

Bhāṣya gloss:

वर्षाः संवत्सराः कुमारस्य वर्धन्तेऽनेनेति वर्षवर्धनम् ।

“By this the years of the boy increase; hence it is called Varṣavardhana.”

Key principle:

दारकस्य जन्मनक्षत्रं यद्दैवर्त्यं सास्य देवता प्रधाना भवति ॥ १५६ ॥

“The child’s birth‑nakṣatra and its deity are primary for this homa.”

Therefore:

तस्मादाघारं हुत्वा तदादि देवता नक्षत्राणि च जुहुयात् ॥ १५७ ॥

“Thus, having offered āghāra, he should make oblations to that deity first and then to the nakṣatras and their deities in order.”

The long list:

अग्नये कृत्तिकाभ्यः, प्रजापतये रोहिण्यै, सोमाय मृगशीर्षाय, रुद्राय आर्द्राया, अदित्यै पुनर्वसुभ्यां, बृहस्पतये तिष्याय, सर्पेभ्यः आश्रेषाभ्यः, पितृभ्यः मघाभ्यः, अर्यम्णे फल्गुनीभ्यां, भगाय फल्गुनीभ्यां, सवित्रे हस्ताय, त्वष्ट्रे चित्रायै, वायवे निष्ट्यायै, इन्द्राग्निभ्यां विशाखाभ्यां, मित्राय अनुराधाभ्यः, इन्द्राय ज्येष्ठायै, प्रजापतये मूलाय, अद्भ्यः आषाढाभ्यां, विश्वेभ्यो देवेभ्यः आषाढाभ्यां, ब्रह्मणे अभिजिते, विष्णवे श्रोणायै, वसुभ्यः श्रविष्ठाभ्यः, वरुणाय शतभिषजे, अजैकपदे प्रोष्ठपदाभ्यः, अहिर्बुध्न्याय प्रोष्ठपदाभ्यः, पूष्णे रेवत्यै, अश्विभ्यां अश्वयुग्भ्यां, यमाय अपभरणीभ्यस्स्वाहा इति व्याहृतीः ॥ १५८ ॥

With the Vyāhṛtis and svāhā, this recites the full Taittirīya‑style nakṣatra–devatā chain. Beginning with the child’s own birth‑star deity, the rite “threads” the boy’s life through the whole Vedic sky each year. Varṣavardhana thus operationalizes over time exactly what Jātakarma’s jyotiṣa‑verse (१२६–१२७) urged: to cultivate and augment the auspicious elements of the horoscope and remediate the harmful.

In sum, from Niṣeka through Varṣavardhana the Vaikhānasa Kalpasūtra, as read by Śrī Nṛsiṃha Vājapeya Yājīn, presents a continuous, Vedic–Vaiṣṇava sacramental arc. Conception, menstrual rhythm, pregnancy, fetal strengthening, late‑pregnancy protection, prenatal consecration to Viṣṇu, birth, first raising, naming and yearly star‑rite are all placed under Agni, the mantras of Ṛg–Yajus–Sāman, the guardianship of Dhātṛ–Varuṇa and the pervasive grace of Nārāyaṇa. This is the concrete shape of Śrī Vaikhānasa Bhagavad‑śāstram’s vision of human life as an unbroken yajña in the body of “Viṣṇu’s child.”
