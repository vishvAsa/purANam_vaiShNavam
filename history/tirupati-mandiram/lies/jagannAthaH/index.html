TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY : TIRUPATI Tirupati is the name of the preent municipal town down the holy hill, on which Lord Venkateswara resides. The word Tirupati appears to be a dialectal form of some original Sanskrit word with some significance. In the English translation of some Malayalam manuscripts made at Chandragiri on 11-6-1802, with reference to the chronological account of sovereigns, references to this town were made as Tirupati and Teeroopaty, the latter also having the same pronunciation. But, in the report of Stratton, district collector, Chittoor, dated 31-1-1803, the hill proper was mentioned to be Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Pagoda and the village down was mentioned to be Tripatty village in all references of the report. In the Mackenzie collections, manuscript translations and reports, translated from Marati by Baboo Rao in 1804, Tripetty was the name given to this town. It is therefore to be inferred that the early part of the nineteenth century was the time for the recogni. tion of the transformation of “Tri” into “Tiru This is often the case with Sanskrit terms in South India. The cause is simplicity and facility in pronunciation, as it appeals to masses. For instance, Trichinopoly or the present day Tiruchchirapalle 2 is the transformed dialect of the Sanskrit term. “Tri Sirah Palle”. So also Trinçumoly, which stands for Trikonagiri of Sanskrit or the present day Tirukkonamalai. In these cases the Sanskrit prefix “Tri” is transformed into “Tiru” to facilitate pronunciation. Similarly in the case of the word Tirupati also the prefix “Tiru” is the transformation of “Tri” of Sanskrit origin. The original word is “TRIPATI”. In the .details of Sri Venkatesa Ashta kshari Manthram, which is adopted in the routine worship of Lord Venkateswara. its Gayathri Manthram is given as below:– “Venkatesaya Vidmahe, Tripati Nadhaya Dhimahi Thannah Srinivasah Prachodayath”. This Ashtakshari Manthram is in vogue in the family of the author hereditarily. Lord Venkateswara is referred therein to be the Lord of Tripati. Tripati is the name of the hill. on which Lord Venkateswara resides. Two centuries back this town Tirupati, down the hill was a small village. Fifteen centuries back there was no village at all down the hill, but a huge forest existed, extending all round the hill upto the Bay of Bengal in the east, upto the river Pinakini or Penna in the north, and a long distance in west and south, as per the Kaifiats of Kota, Chittivel, Chowdeswari Nandavanam and Talpagiri. Gradually with the growing importance of 3 Tirupati hill, a village down the hill emanated and developed into a town. The name of the hill extended to the village or town below, which mainly depended on the former’s prosperity. Even today the public of Tirupati call the hill, UpTirupati, and the town, Down-Tirupati, the Telugu terms in vogue being “Eguva “Eguva Tirupati &#34; and “Diguva Tirupati “. This has also reference to Stratton’s report, which mentions the names of Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Village seperately. The word Tirupati cannot be a dialectal form of Triputi❞ as interpreted by certain authors. There is no significance at all connected with the history of the place or the presiding deity. Nor is it derived from Sripati in a similar manner. The word Tirupati is a Telugu dialectal form and cannot be a Tamil one. In Tamil it should have been “Tirubadi” or “Tiruppadi “. These two forms are not at all found in any part of the history of Tirupati nor in any of the inscriptions in Tamil. The hill is mentioned to be “Vengadam” in all Tamil inscriptions. It is a dialectal form of “Venkata” of Sanskrit. Tirumala of Telugu and Tirumalai of Tamil are cognates, derived from the Sanskrit word “Sri Saila” which has reference in the concerned Puranas and the history of Tirupati. But these words are of a very recent origin, coined to create difference between the hill proper and the 4 town below it. It would not be even a century since these words were used. We do not find them in ancient literature. TIRUCHANUR: Tiruchanur is a small village within three miles from Tirupati. dialectal form of the Sanskrit term The transformation is as follows: Tiruchanur is a “Sri Suka Puri”. Sri Suka Puri - Tiru Chugan Uru - Tiruchchuganur Tiruchchuhanur Tiruchanur. The railway station of this village is named “Chiratanur”. This is a result of metathesis according to philology. The word Tiruchchuganur is found in certain, inscriptionfrom Yogula Mallavaramu, an adjoining village of ancient repute. Sri Suka Puri is the place, where the famous saint Suka did penance and the two adjoining villages on either side of the river Swarnamukhi, namely Yogulamallavaramu and Munulapudi are pure unadulterated Telugu words with historic reference in vogue from time immemorial. By the side of Munulapudi is another village called Padipeta, renowned for its cattle wealth and Telugu origin. A brief of this place, Tiruchanur, may not be out of place to an interested reader. Tiruchanui is now called Alamelumangapuram also. Alamelumanga Thayar or Padmavathi, alleged to be the consort of Lord Venkateswara, was installed in an 5 already existing temple at the time of Vaishnava (lomination. References from inscriptions denote an ancient temple. going by the name of “Illan Koil at Tiruchanur. Illan Koil means the temple of the younger. Vaishnavaites interpret Illan to be Bala Krishna and Saivaites interpret Illan to be Bala Subrahmanya, as sung by ancient devotees. Illan Koil is not existing now at Tiruchanur. The present temple at Tiruchanur has a presiding deity. Lord Krishna, directly opposite to the main entrance and Alamelumanga is to a side. This is an evidence to prove that the installation of Alamc lumanga is very recent. Some inscribed stones referring to Illan Koil are found in the construction of the present temple. Some other such stones with inscriptions are found at the basement of resident houses. There was an Illan Koil of Saivaite importance at Tiruchanur before the seventh century, when Saivism thrived. But sub. sequently with the downfall of Saivism during the seventh century this temple was deserted and pulled down and the stones from it were used in the construction of the present temple. Such stones, bearing inscriptions, are noted by the iconographists. To attribute the antique repute of Illan Koil to Vaishnavism the present day temple was built with Krishna as the presiding deity to represent Illan. The worship at this temple is according to Pancha Ratra Agama and by Vaishnavas, whereas the6 worship at hill to Lord Venkateswara is according to Vaikhanasa Agama and by Vaikhanasas only. Many Alwars referred to Krishna or Manavala Perumal of Tiruchanur in their songs, which do not offer any clue to the date and place of the deity. The deities at Tiruchanur are referred to in inscriptions as Tiruvilonkoil Perumanadigal, Tirumantrasalai Perumanadigal and Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal. The main deity was Tiruvegatattu Perumanadigal, which was very much mistaken by many authors to be Lord Venkateswara on the hill These deities date back to the last quarter of the eighth century as per inscriptional authority. The Saivaite Illan Koil should have disappeared in the seventh century and the Vaishnavaite Illan Koil or Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal should have come into existence early in the eighth century before the period of Sri Ramanuja itself. Inscriptional evidence of grants and endowments for the Akhandam to be maintained in this newly built temple is available. Even today an author interprets Illan Koil to be Snapana Mantapa of Lord Venkateswara on the hill with a motive. Very early Alwars did not visit Lord Venkateswara, but described him in their prayers to be a blend of Hari and Hara. In the tenth century Nammalwar ascended the hill and prayed Lord 7 Venkateswara to be the embodiment of the Omni. present Vishnu. He consecrated a silver image at about 966 A.D. in the temple on the hill and called it Manavala Perumal. There is a difference of about two centuries between the consecration of a Vaishnava temple at Tiruchanur and the first Alwar to ascend the hill to consecrate a Vaishnava image on the hill. Many Alwars abstained from ascending the hill to worship Lord Venkateswara for fear that the deity was a Siva with Saivaite. paraphernalia. Customarily some turmeric and Kumkum is used to be sent from the hill to Tiruchanur during the annual festival at the latter. But there is no inscriptional evidence to prove it to be an ancient one. Silappadikaram, an oft quoted authority, the antiquity of which was dated back to about 756 A.D. by Dr. Swamikannu, does not tell. us that the hill was sacred nor does it say when the god manifested himself there. But the same authority corroborates the facts given above in respect of the deities consecrated at Tiruchanur. ALIPIRI: This is the name, by which the foot of the hill, from where the route to the hill commences, is called. Alipiri is a pure Telugu word, meaning miniature. It means that Lord Venkateswara in his miniature form dwells there to give Darshan to his non-caste-hindu devotees, who were forbidden in those days to ascend the hill. Mala- 8 vani Gundam is a pure Telugu term. It is close to Alipiti. That portion of GOVINDARAJA PATTANA: Tirupati, where Lord Govindaraja is consecrated, Is called Govindaraja Pattana. Inspite of its existence from the year 1050 A.D., when Tiruverenda Yadavarayalu reigned and got Govindaraja consecrated, the whole town Tirupati is universally called Tirupati only. CHANDRAGIRI: This is a village six miles off from Tirupati. It is of historic importance with an old fort and remnants of scientific materials, which conduct the gong sound from the Venkatadri hill to Chandragiri fort. Archaelogical findings of Jain importance are also found there. The original name is traditionally maintained in its Telugu form. In Tamil it should have been called Sandira Malai, but such a term is absent. This is supposed to have come into existence at about 1330 A.D. from the time of Saluva Mangi Deva. THEERTHAMS: All the Theerthams of Puranic importance on and around the hill, connected with the shrme of Lord Venkateswara, have retained heir original names in Sanskrit, such as Kapila Theertham, Bheema Theertham, Gogarbham, Pandava Theertham, Akasa Ganga, Papanasanam. 9 Sesha Theertham, Ramakrishna Theertham, Thumburu Theertham, etc. There are some Theerthams, which bear pure Telugu names, such as Pasupu Theertham and Seethamma Theertham. All the names, connected with the different parts of the hill and forest around this hill, are of pure Telugu language, as inferred from any map of this hill. The words Vagu, Vanka and Kona are widely used in such terminology. TRADITIONAL TELUGU WORDS IN USE: The following pure Telugu words were used in the time of Mackenzie in 1803 A.D.:Kuruvá Dova (Hill path), Padikavali (Gateman), Bangaru Vakili (Gold entrance), Koppera (Hundi), Gudi (Temple), Thotti Theertham (Holy water of the tub), Koluvu (Durbar), Alavattam (Fan), Parasa (Pilgrim), Kanuka (Offering), Cherupu (Food - derived from the word Cherava, meaning a wide-mouthed vessel in which food is made to offer to god), Laddu (A round pudding), Sukiya (A sweet preparation), Thena Thola (Another sweet preparation), Ookaya Pachchadi (A dish made with Ookaya), Mudupu (Money bag), Duggani (Duga&#43;Kani=Two pies), Pavada (An offering as Bali), Etc. In the report of Stratton the following Telugu words were used :– Ookaya, Kanukalu, Varthana (Maintenance), Mangala Katta (Barbers’ bund), Mancham Seva or Panupu Seva (Repose worship), Addala Ara (Hall 10 of mirrors), Namala Angadi (Market of marking mud), Poola Bavi (Well used to deposit flowers), Nambi (One who worships god. This term was very widely used by both Mackenzie and Stratton). In both the above reports the following South Indian cognates were observed: Thiruvaradhana (Worship), Thomala Seva (A variety of worship). Vada (A hot cake), Poli (A sweet cake), Dosa (A flat pudding), Appam (A sweet flat pudding), Padi (A measure), Kani (A measure of land), etc. In Cox’s gazette the following words were used:Addakonda (The name of a hill), Muggu Bavi (A well or tank in the middle of the ascent of the hill), Gangalam (A wide-mouthed vessel), Poolangi (Flower decoration), Namala Guha (A cave, where white and red earth is found), etc, Zunnu Padi was endowed by Muru Raja Rama Raja Sripathi Obaleswara at about 1546 A.D. Zunnu is a Telugu term. All the traditional terms are Telugu terms but for a few Vaishnava technical terms of worship, introduced during the era of Sri Ramanuja. VENKATESWARA : The name of the deity on He is also called Venka- the hill is Venkateswara. tesa, Venkatachalapati. Venkataramana. Tiru- vengadaththan, etc. He is the Lord of the hill Venkata. The word Venkata is interpreted thus in Venkatachala Mahathmyam : 11 वेंकारोऽमृत बीजस्तु कटमैश्वर्य मुच्यते । अमृतैश्वर्य संघत्वा कटाद्रि रिति स्मृतः ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - लो. ३२. Vem = Eternal; Kata Bliss; Venkata = Eternal Bliss; the hill that conduces Eternal Bliss is called Venkatadri or Venkatachala and the Lord of such a hill is called Venkateswara. In another version, Vem Sin; Kata= Destroy or burn; Venkata= That which destroys or burns sins or purifier. Many authors are of opinion that these are not etymological. Sanskrit is so tightly knit that not a single word in it is left behind without an etymological origin. These interpretations are of Puranic origin only. They intend to support the supremacy of a particular deity in an idealistic way to convince the masses. The word Vengada is used by both the Andhras and Tamilians in common for Tirupati, but the etymological version is different. In the Andhra version it is Vengi Kada Vengada. ie. the boundary or limit of the territory called Vengi and ruled by the Andhra kings. In Tamil it is Ven&#43;Gadam Vengadam, meaning a white hill. Venkatachala is said to be of a molten gold colour and hence named Kanakachala. It was praised as such by many devotees of Andhra and Tamil culture. It is not mentioned to be white in 12 colour by any body anywhere. Therefore the word Vengadam is only a dialectal form of the Sanskrit term, Venkata, and not an independant Tamil word. Chandramana of Hindu calendar is observed by Andhras and the Souramana by Tamilians. Here on this hill in the shrine of Lord Venkateswara Chandramana is observed. New year’s Asthanam takes place on the Telugu new year’s day. Chandramana is in use upto and includnig Sesha. chala and Souraniana beyond and south of it, as per Jyothisha Siddhantha. SESHACHALA: SESHAGIRI: SESHADRI: SESHASAILA: These are all synonyms indicating the name of the hill, bearing reference to Sesha or the Adi Sesha. In Venkatachala Mahatınyam it is said. that Adi Sesha, in a conflict with Vayu, was blown off and deposited here. This Sesha is connected with Meru and Meru Puthra in the same Purana. This has a philosophical meaning, with special reference to the science of Yoga, which will be explained in the last chapter. BUSA NAGAPPADU is a pure Telugu term relating to Lord Venkateswara, indicating his origin to be that of a serpent, in virtue of his residence and identity with Seshadri and his emanating from an ant-hill. He is called Vyala Rupa in his one thousand names and it confirms this view. 13 SRISAILA: Srisaila and Venkatachala are synonyms. Srisaila is the original name of the hill, as illustrated in Venkatachala Mahatmya : श्रीपदत्वात् श्रियोवासात् शब्दशक्त्याच योगतः । रूढ्या श्रीशैल इत्येवं नामचास्य गिरेरभूत् ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - श्लो. ३४. Many authors quote a verse from Rigveda and attribute it to this Venkatachala. The early commentators Sayana and Yaska completely ignored this Venkatachala. Later authors commented Vikate Girim to be Venkatachala, attributing the word Sirim Bittasya to it. Sirim Bittasya is said to be Sree Peettasya. It means that the hill is an abode of Sree, which means Sree Chakra or the supreme Chakra, the Sahasrara. This version is in common vogue both in the Andhra and Tamil countries. We hear an Andhra call this deity “Edu Kondala Vadu” and a Tamilian call this deity “Elu Malai Appan”. This is not an outcome of or a translation of or a dialectal form of any original Sanskrit term, but an original South Indian term representing this hill to be seven in number in anology to the six Chakras and the seventh SahaThe establishment of the importance of this hill connected with the Sri Chakra is not limited srara. 14 only to South India, but extends to the whole of North India. Sri Chakra is a form of worship of Bala Tripura Sundari. Hence the North Indians call the hill and the deity “Balaji”. The Vaishnava commentary interpreted Sri to be the goddess Lakshmi, and the abode of which is Sri Nivasam. The latter term, when compounded means Vishnu, the lord of Lakshmi. But the term Sri Saila is in reference to a hill but not a deity thereupon. The derivative explanation of the term, relating to the deity, Venkata, is given quite seperately. If Sri is considered to be Lakshmi, Lakshmi-in some form or other should be the presiding deity there on the hill, irrespective of Vishnu. It is not so. There is no place seperately for either Lakshmi or any other Sree. A recent devotet connected with the management of the temple introduced “Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam”, which did not gain any importance nor achieve the aim with which it was introduced. One should try to understand the principle on which the consort is omitted to this Lord Venkateswara. This is explained by Yoga science in the last chapter. CONCLUSION: From a survey of traditional terminology, it is evident that all the terms are of Telugu origin. The area of the hill with its surrounding villages is purely Andhra, There are inscriptional evidences to show that many endow- 15 ments were made by Andhra kings, but it is a freak to note that such inscriptions are in Tamil. Inscriptions dating back to sixteenth century, ie. 1509. 1530 the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya and 1565-1684: the reign of Aravidu Rajas, appear in Tamil. It is believed that the heads of temple department then were Tamil Vaishnavaites, who took to inscriptional work in Tamil. There is no evidence to prove that Sri Krishna Deva Raya ever paid a visit to the temple of Govindaraja or that of Alamelumanga, nor that he endowed any thing to those temples. DEVOTEES OF REPUTE. Gopinatha is said to be the first Vaikhanasa, that worshipped Lord Venkateswara. He did penance on the hill and dedicated his life to Him. Ranga Doss was another devotee from Rangampeta. a village ten miles off from Tirupati, who dedicated his life to Lord Venkateswara. Both of them it is alleged were together doing service to god. They were supposed to be in the reign of King Sakhana of Kambhoja Desa. But historical evidences are not available. Ranga Doss was supplying flowers to god and Gopinath was worshipping god in very early days. Thallapaka Annamacharyulu was a devotee well known to all Andhra. He was born on a full16">

The worship at this temple is according to Pancha Ratra Agama and by Vaishnavas, whereas the6 worship at hill to Lord Venkateswara is according to Vaikhanasa Agama and by Vaikhanasas only. Many Alwars referred to Krishna or Manavala Perumal of Tiruchanur in their songs, which do not offer any clue to the date and place of the deity. The deities at Tiruchanur are referred to in inscriptions as Tiruvilonkoil Perumanadigal, Tirumantrasalai Perumanadigal and Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal. The main deity was Tiruvegatattu Perumanadigal, which was very much mistaken by many authors to be Lord Venkateswara on the hill These deities date back to the last quarter of the eighth century as per inscriptional authority. The Saivaite Illan Koil should have disappeared in the seventh century and the Vaishnavaite Illan Koil or Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal should have come into existence early in the eighth century before the period of Sri Ramanuja itself. Inscriptional evidence of grants and endowments for the Akhandam to be maintained in this newly built temple is available. Even today an author interprets Illan Koil to be Snapana Mantapa of Lord Venkateswara on the hill with a motive. Very early Alwars did not visit Lord Venkateswara, but described him in their prayers to be a blend of Hari and Hara. In the tenth century Nammalwar ascended the hill and prayed Lord 7 Venkateswara to be the embodiment of the Omni. present Vishnu. He consecrated a silver image at about 966 A.D. in the temple on the hill and called it Manavala Perumal. There is a difference of about two centuries between the consecration of a Vaishnava temple at Tiruchanur and the first Alwar to ascend the hill to consecrate a Vaishnava image on the hill. Many Alwars abstained from ascending the hill to worship Lord Venkateswara for fear that the deity was a Siva with Saivaite. paraphernalia. Customarily some turmeric and Kumkum is used to be sent from the hill to Tiruchanur during the annual festival at the latter. But there is no inscriptional evidence to prove it to be an ancient one. Silappadikaram, an oft quoted authority, the antiquity of which was dated back to about 756 A.D. by Dr. Swamikannu, does not tell. us that the hill was sacred nor does it say when the god manifested himself there. But the same authority corroborates the facts given above in respect of the deities consecrated at Tiruchanur. ALIPIRI: This is the name, by which the foot of the hill, from where the route to the hill commences, is called. Alipiri is a pure Telugu word, meaning miniature. It means that Lord Venkateswara in his miniature form dwells there to give Darshan to his non-caste-hindu devotees, who were forbidden in those days to ascend the hill. Mala- 8 vani Gundam is a pure Telugu term. It is close to Alipiti. That portion of GOVINDARAJA PATTANA: Tirupati, where Lord Govindaraja is consecrated, Is called Govindaraja Pattana. Inspite of its existence from the year 1050 A.D., when Tiruverenda Yadavarayalu reigned and got Govindaraja consecrated, the whole town Tirupati is universally called Tirupati only. CHANDRAGIRI: This is a village six miles off from Tirupati. It is of historic importance with an old fort and remnants of scientific materials, which conduct the gong sound from the Venkatadri hill to Chandragiri fort. Archaelogical findings of Jain importance are also found there. The original name is traditionally maintained in its Telugu form. In Tamil it should have been called Sandira Malai, but such a term is absent. This is supposed to have come into existence at about 1330 A.D. from the time of Saluva Mangi Deva. THEERTHAMS: All the Theerthams of Puranic importance on and around the hill, connected with the shrme of Lord Venkateswara, have retained heir original names in Sanskrit, such as Kapila Theertham, Bheema Theertham, Gogarbham, Pandava Theertham, Akasa Ganga, Papanasanam. 9 Sesha Theertham, Ramakrishna Theertham, Thumburu Theertham, etc. There are some Theerthams, which bear pure Telugu names, such as Pasupu Theertham and Seethamma Theertham. All the names, connected with the different parts of the hill and forest around this hill, are of pure Telugu language, as inferred from any map of this hill. The words Vagu, Vanka and Kona are widely used in such terminology. TRADITIONAL TELUGU WORDS IN USE: The following pure Telugu words were used in the time of Mackenzie in 1803 A.D.:Kuruvá Dova (Hill path), Padikavali (Gateman), Bangaru Vakili (Gold entrance), Koppera (Hundi), Gudi (Temple), Thotti Theertham (Holy water of the tub), Koluvu (Durbar), Alavattam (Fan), Parasa (Pilgrim), Kanuka (Offering), Cherupu (Food - derived from the word Cherava, meaning a wide-mouthed vessel in which food is made to offer to god), Laddu (A round pudding), Sukiya (A sweet preparation), Thena Thola (Another sweet preparation), Ookaya Pachchadi (A dish made with Ookaya), Mudupu (Money bag), Duggani (Duga&#43;Kani=Two pies), Pavada (An offering as Bali), Etc. In the report of Stratton the following Telugu words were used :– Ookaya, Kanukalu, Varthana (Maintenance), Mangala Katta (Barbers’ bund), Mancham Seva or Panupu Seva (Repose worship), Addala Ara (Hall 10 of mirrors), Namala Angadi (Market of marking mud), Poola Bavi (Well used to deposit flowers), Nambi (One who worships god. This term was very widely used by both Mackenzie and Stratton). In both the above reports the following South Indian cognates were observed: Thiruvaradhana (Worship), Thomala Seva (A variety of worship). Vada (A hot cake), Poli (A sweet cake), Dosa (A flat pudding), Appam (A sweet flat pudding), Padi (A measure), Kani (A measure of land), etc. In Cox’s gazette the following words were used:Addakonda (The name of a hill), Muggu Bavi (A well or tank in the middle of the ascent of the hill), Gangalam (A wide-mouthed vessel), Poolangi (Flower decoration), Namala Guha (A cave, where white and red earth is found), etc, Zunnu Padi was endowed by Muru Raja Rama Raja Sripathi Obaleswara at about 1546 A.D. Zunnu is a Telugu term. All the traditional terms are Telugu terms but for a few Vaishnava technical terms of worship, introduced during the era of Sri Ramanuja. VENKATESWARA : The name of the deity on He is also called Venka- the hill is Venkateswara. tesa, Venkatachalapati. Venkataramana. Tiru- vengadaththan, etc. He is the Lord of the hill Venkata. The word Venkata is interpreted thus in Venkatachala Mahathmyam : 11 वेंकारोऽमृत बीजस्तु कटमैश्वर्य मुच्यते । अमृतैश्वर्य संघत्वा कटाद्रि रिति स्मृतः ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - लो. ३२. Vem = Eternal; Kata Bliss; Venkata = Eternal Bliss; the hill that conduces Eternal Bliss is called Venkatadri or Venkatachala and the Lord of such a hill is called Venkateswara. In another version, Vem Sin; Kata= Destroy or burn; Venkata= That which destroys or burns sins or purifier. Many authors are of opinion that these are not etymological. Sanskrit is so tightly knit that not a single word in it is left behind without an etymological origin. These interpretations are of Puranic origin only. They intend to support the supremacy of a particular deity in an idealistic way to convince the masses. The word Vengada is used by both the Andhras and Tamilians in common for Tirupati, but the etymological version is different. In the Andhra version it is Vengi Kada Vengada. ie. the boundary or limit of the territory called Vengi and ruled by the Andhra kings. In Tamil it is Ven&#43;Gadam Vengadam, meaning a white hill. Venkatachala is said to be of a molten gold colour and hence named Kanakachala. It was praised as such by many devotees of Andhra and Tamil culture. It is not mentioned to be white in 12 colour by any body anywhere. Therefore the word Vengadam is only a dialectal form of the Sanskrit term, Venkata, and not an independant Tamil word. Chandramana of Hindu calendar is observed by Andhras and the Souramana by Tamilians. Here on this hill in the shrine of Lord Venkateswara Chandramana is observed. New year’s Asthanam takes place on the Telugu new year’s day. Chandramana is in use upto and includnig Sesha. chala and Souraniana beyond and south of it, as per Jyothisha Siddhantha. SESHACHALA: SESHAGIRI: SESHADRI: SESHASAILA: These are all synonyms indicating the name of the hill, bearing reference to Sesha or the Adi Sesha. In Venkatachala Mahatınyam it is said. that Adi Sesha, in a conflict with Vayu, was blown off and deposited here. This Sesha is connected with Meru and Meru Puthra in the same Purana. This has a philosophical meaning, with special reference to the science of Yoga, which will be explained in the last chapter. BUSA NAGAPPADU is a pure Telugu term relating to Lord Venkateswara, indicating his origin to be that of a serpent, in virtue of his residence and identity with Seshadri and his emanating from an ant-hill. He is called Vyala Rupa in his one thousand names and it confirms this view. 13 SRISAILA: Srisaila and Venkatachala are synonyms. Srisaila is the original name of the hill, as illustrated in Venkatachala Mahatmya : श्रीपदत्वात् श्रियोवासात् शब्दशक्त्याच योगतः । रूढ्या श्रीशैल इत्येवं नामचास्य गिरेरभूत् ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - श्लो. ३४. Many authors quote a verse from Rigveda and attribute it to this Venkatachala. The early commentators Sayana and Yaska completely ignored this Venkatachala. Later authors commented Vikate Girim to be Venkatachala, attributing the word Sirim Bittasya to it. Sirim Bittasya is said to be Sree Peettasya. It means that the hill is an abode of Sree, which means Sree Chakra or the supreme Chakra, the Sahasrara. This version is in common vogue both in the Andhra and Tamil countries. We hear an Andhra call this deity “Edu Kondala Vadu” and a Tamilian call this deity “Elu Malai Appan”. This is not an outcome of or a translation of or a dialectal form of any original Sanskrit term, but an original South Indian term representing this hill to be seven in number in anology to the six Chakras and the seventh SahaThe establishment of the importance of this hill connected with the Sri Chakra is not limited srara. 14 only to South India, but extends to the whole of North India. Sri Chakra is a form of worship of Bala Tripura Sundari. Hence the North Indians call the hill and the deity “Balaji”. The Vaishnava commentary interpreted Sri to be the goddess Lakshmi, and the abode of which is Sri Nivasam. The latter term, when compounded means Vishnu, the lord of Lakshmi. But the term Sri Saila is in reference to a hill but not a deity thereupon. The derivative explanation of the term, relating to the deity, Venkata, is given quite seperately. If Sri is considered to be Lakshmi, Lakshmi-in some form or other should be the presiding deity there on the hill, irrespective of Vishnu. It is not so. There is no place seperately for either Lakshmi or any other Sree. A recent devotet connected with the management of the temple introduced “Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam”, which did not gain any importance nor achieve the aim with which it was introduced. One should try to understand the principle on which the consort is omitted to this Lord Venkateswara. This is explained by Yoga science in the last chapter. CONCLUSION: From a survey of traditional terminology, it is evident that all the terms are of Telugu origin. The area of the hill with its surrounding villages is purely Andhra, There are inscriptional evidences to show that many endow- 15 ments were made by Andhra kings, but it is a freak to note that such inscriptions are in Tamil. Inscriptions dating back to sixteenth century, ie. 1509. 1530 the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya and 1565-1684: the reign of Aravidu Rajas, appear in Tamil. It is believed that the heads of temple department then were Tamil Vaishnavaites, who took to inscriptional work in Tamil. There is no evidence to prove that Sri Krishna Deva Raya ever paid a visit to the temple of Govindaraja or that of Alamelumanga, nor that he endowed any thing to those temples. DEVOTEES OF REPUTE. Gopinatha is said to be the first Vaikhanasa, that worshipped Lord Venkateswara. He did penance on the hill and dedicated his life to Him. Ranga Doss was another devotee from Rangampeta. a village ten miles off from Tirupati, who dedicated his life to Lord Venkateswara. Both of them it is alleged were together doing service to god. They were supposed to be in the reign of King Sakhana of Kambhoja Desa. But historical evidences are not available. Ranga Doss was supplying flowers to god and Gopinath was worshipping god in very early days. Thallapaka Annamacharyulu was a devotee well known to all Andhra. He was born on a full16">

I was brought by my father in my fifth year to Tirupati to have a Darshan of Lord Venkate ever since I had an admiration and appretwo decades, resulting in Tirupati permanantly in ciation for Him for over my settling down here at the year 1932. I wanted to guess what He stands for and what His message is in terms of Hindu philosophy. I came to a conclusion after twenty years. I felt it my duty to give out what 1 conceived and this booklet is its manifestation. I thank His Holi ness Sri Sri Mahant Narayanadossji Varu of Sr Hathiramji Mutt, Tirupati, who encouraged me in writing this booklet and patronised me in getting this published for the benefit of the public. Publications under the title of ‘History of Tirupati’ by sectarian authors gave an impetus to my quest and the latest publication “Tirupati Sri Venkateswara–Balaji’ by Sri V. N. Srinivasa Rao was appeasing. I feel it my duty to offer my thank: to Sri V. N. Srinivasa Rao, who has dealt with the subject in detail in an impartial and nonsectarian way. My pen recorded only original views and failed to make mention of the history, chronologi- 2 cal sovereignty, religious endowments and the mode of administration relating to the shrine. I am a disciple of Ahobila Mutt and I believe in Vaishnavism but I do not belong to the fanatic school. I am of view that every Hindu has an equal claim to Lord Venkateswara and that even non-Hindus would someday or other devote themselves to Lord Venkateswara, who is an exponent of universal oneness of religion. May Lord Venkateswara bless us all. P. T. Jagannadha Rao Dedicated to Lord Venkateswara - Balaji. य: न : धिय: प्रचोदयात्. TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY : TIRUPATI Tirupati is the name of the preent municipal town down the holy hill, on which Lord Venkateswara resides. The word Tirupati appears to be a dialectal form of some original Sanskrit word with some significance. In the English translation of some Malayalam manuscripts made at Chandragiri on 11-6-1802, with reference to the chronological account of sovereigns, references to this town were made as Tirupati and Teeroopaty, the latter also having the same pronunciation. But, in the report of Stratton, district collector, Chittoor, dated 31-1-1803, the hill proper was mentioned to be Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Pagoda and the village down was mentioned to be Tripatty village in all references of the report. In the Mackenzie collections, manuscript translations and reports, translated from Marati by Baboo Rao in 1804, Tripetty was the name given to this town. It is therefore to be inferred that the early part of the nineteenth century was the time for the recogni. tion of the transformation of “Tri” into “Tiru This is often the case with Sanskrit terms in South India. The cause is simplicity and facility in pronunciation, as it appeals to masses. For instance, Trichinopoly or the present day Tiruchchirapalle 2 is the transformed dialect of the Sanskrit term. “Tri Sirah Palle”. So also Trinçumoly, which stands for Trikonagiri of Sanskrit or the present day Tirukkonamalai. In these cases the Sanskrit prefix “Tri” is transformed into “Tiru” to facilitate pronunciation. Similarly in the case of the word Tirupati also the prefix “Tiru” is the transformation of “Tri” of Sanskrit origin. The original word is “TRIPATI”. In the .details of Sri Venkatesa Ashta kshari Manthram, which is adopted in the routine worship of Lord Venkateswara. its Gayathri Manthram is given as below:– “Venkatesaya Vidmahe, Tripati Nadhaya Dhimahi Thannah Srinivasah Prachodayath”. This Ashtakshari Manthram is in vogue in the family of the author hereditarily. Lord Venkateswara is referred therein to be the Lord of Tripati. Tripati is the name of the hill. on which Lord Venkateswara resides. Two centuries back this town Tirupati, down the hill was a small village. Fifteen centuries back there was no village at all down the hill, but a huge forest existed, extending all round the hill upto the Bay of Bengal in the east, upto the river Pinakini or Penna in the north, and a long distance in west and south, as per the Kaifiats of Kota, Chittivel, Chowdeswari Nandavanam and Talpagiri. Gradually with the growing importance of 3 Tirupati hill, a village down the hill emanated and developed into a town. The name of the hill extended to the village or town below, which mainly depended on the former’s prosperity. Even today the public of Tirupati call the hill, UpTirupati, and the town, Down-Tirupati, the Telugu terms in vogue being “Eguva “Eguva Tirupati &#34; and “Diguva Tirupati “. This has also reference to Stratton’s report, which mentions the names of Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Village seperately. The word Tirupati cannot be a dialectal form of Triputi❞ as interpreted by certain authors. There is no significance at all connected with the history of the place or the presiding deity. Nor is it derived from Sripati in a similar manner. The word Tirupati is a Telugu dialectal form and cannot be a Tamil one. In Tamil it should have been “Tirubadi” or “Tiruppadi “. These two forms are not at all found in any part of the history of Tirupati nor in any of the inscriptions in Tamil. The hill is mentioned to be “Vengadam” in all Tamil inscriptions. It is a dialectal form of “Venkata” of Sanskrit. Tirumala of Telugu and Tirumalai of Tamil are cognates, derived from the Sanskrit word “Sri Saila” which has reference in the concerned Puranas and the history of Tirupati. But these words are of a very recent origin, coined to create difference between the hill proper and the 4 town below it. It would not be even a century since these words were used. We do not find them in ancient literature. TIRUCHANUR: Tiruchanur is a small village within three miles from Tirupati. dialectal form of the Sanskrit term The transformation is as follows: Tiruchanur is a “Sri Suka Puri”. Sri Suka Puri - Tiru Chugan Uru - Tiruchchuganur Tiruchchuhanur Tiruchanur. The railway station of this village is named “Chiratanur”. This is a result of metathesis according to philology. The word Tiruchchuganur is found in certain, inscriptionfrom Yogula Mallavaramu, an adjoining village of ancient repute. Sri Suka Puri is the place, where the famous saint Suka did penance and the two adjoining villages on either side of the river Swarnamukhi, namely Yogulamallavaramu and Munulapudi are pure unadulterated Telugu words with historic reference in vogue from time immemorial. By the side of Munulapudi is another village called Padipeta, renowned for its cattle wealth and Telugu origin. A brief of this place, Tiruchanur, may not be out of place to an interested reader. Tiruchanui is now called Alamelumangapuram also. Alamelumanga Thayar or Padmavathi, alleged to be the consort of Lord Venkateswara, was installed in an 5 already existing temple at the time of Vaishnava (lomination. References from inscriptions denote an ancient temple. going by the name of “Illan Koil at Tiruchanur. Illan Koil means the temple of the younger. Vaishnavaites interpret Illan to be Bala Krishna and Saivaites interpret Illan to be Bala Subrahmanya, as sung by ancient devotees. Illan Koil is not existing now at Tiruchanur. The present temple at Tiruchanur has a presiding deity. Lord Krishna, directly opposite to the main entrance and Alamelumanga is to a side. This is an evidence to prove that the installation of Alamc lumanga is very recent. Some inscribed stones referring to Illan Koil are found in the construction of the present temple. Some other such stones with inscriptions are found at the basement of resident houses. There was an Illan Koil of Saivaite importance at Tiruchanur before the seventh century, when Saivism thrived. But sub. sequently with the downfall of Saivism during the seventh century this temple was deserted and pulled down and the stones from it were used in the construction of the present temple. Such stones, bearing inscriptions, are noted by the iconographists. To attribute the antique repute of Illan Koil to Vaishnavism the present day temple was built with Krishna as the presiding deity to represent Illan. The worship at this temple is according to Pancha Ratra Agama and by Vaishnavas, whereas the6 worship at hill to Lord Venkateswara is according to Vaikhanasa Agama and by Vaikhanasas only. Many Alwars referred to Krishna or Manavala Perumal of Tiruchanur in their songs, which do not offer any clue to the date and place of the deity. The deities at Tiruchanur are referred to in inscriptions as Tiruvilonkoil Perumanadigal, Tirumantrasalai Perumanadigal and Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal. The main deity was Tiruvegatattu Perumanadigal, which was very much mistaken by many authors to be Lord Venkateswara on the hill These deities date back to the last quarter of the eighth century as per inscriptional authority. The Saivaite Illan Koil should have disappeared in the seventh century and the Vaishnavaite Illan Koil or Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal should have come into existence early in the eighth century before the period of Sri Ramanuja itself. Inscriptional evidence of grants and endowments for the Akhandam to be maintained in this newly built temple is available. Even today an author interprets Illan Koil to be Snapana Mantapa of Lord Venkateswara on the hill with a motive. Very early Alwars did not visit Lord Venkateswara, but described him in their prayers to be a blend of Hari and Hara. In the tenth century Nammalwar ascended the hill and prayed Lord 7 Venkateswara to be the embodiment of the Omni. present Vishnu. He consecrated a silver image at about 966 A.D. in the temple on the hill and called it Manavala Perumal. There is a difference of about two centuries between the consecration of a Vaishnava temple at Tiruchanur and the first Alwar to ascend the hill to consecrate a Vaishnava image on the hill. Many Alwars abstained from ascending the hill to worship Lord Venkateswara for fear that the deity was a Siva with Saivaite. paraphernalia. Customarily some turmeric and Kumkum is used to be sent from the hill to Tiruchanur during the annual festival at the latter. But there is no inscriptional evidence to prove it to be an ancient one. Silappadikaram, an oft quoted authority, the antiquity of which was dated back to about 756 A.D. by Dr. Swamikannu, does not tell. us that the hill was sacred nor does it say when the god manifested himself there. But the same authority corroborates the facts given above in respect of the deities consecrated at Tiruchanur. ALIPIRI: This is the name, by which the foot of the hill, from where the route to the hill commences, is called. Alipiri is a pure Telugu word, meaning miniature. It means that Lord Venkateswara in his miniature form dwells there to give Darshan to his non-caste-hindu devotees, who were forbidden in those days to ascend the hill. Mala- 8 vani Gundam is a pure Telugu term. It is close to Alipiti. That portion of GOVINDARAJA PATTANA: Tirupati, where Lord Govindaraja is consecrated, Is called Govindaraja Pattana. Inspite of its existence from the year 1050 A.D., when Tiruverenda Yadavarayalu reigned and got Govindaraja consecrated, the whole town Tirupati is universally called Tirupati only. CHANDRAGIRI: This is a village six miles off from Tirupati. It is of historic importance with an old fort and remnants of scientific materials, which conduct the gong sound from the Venkatadri hill to Chandragiri fort. Archaelogical findings of Jain importance are also found there. The original name is traditionally maintained in its Telugu form. In Tamil it should have been called Sandira Malai, but such a term is absent. This is supposed to have come into existence at about 1330 A.D. from the time of Saluva Mangi Deva. THEERTHAMS: All the Theerthams of Puranic importance on and around the hill, connected with the shrme of Lord Venkateswara, have retained heir original names in Sanskrit, such as Kapila Theertham, Bheema Theertham, Gogarbham, Pandava Theertham, Akasa Ganga, Papanasanam. 9 Sesha Theertham, Ramakrishna Theertham, Thumburu Theertham, etc. There are some Theerthams, which bear pure Telugu names, such as Pasupu Theertham and Seethamma Theertham. All the names, connected with the different parts of the hill and forest around this hill, are of pure Telugu language, as inferred from any map of this hill. The words Vagu, Vanka and Kona are widely used in such terminology. TRADITIONAL TELUGU WORDS IN USE: The following pure Telugu words were used in the time of Mackenzie in 1803 A.D.:Kuruvá Dova (Hill path), Padikavali (Gateman), Bangaru Vakili (Gold entrance), Koppera (Hundi), Gudi (Temple), Thotti Theertham (Holy water of the tub), Koluvu (Durbar), Alavattam (Fan), Parasa (Pilgrim), Kanuka (Offering), Cherupu (Food - derived from the word Cherava, meaning a wide-mouthed vessel in which food is made to offer to god), Laddu (A round pudding), Sukiya (A sweet preparation), Thena Thola (Another sweet preparation), Ookaya Pachchadi (A dish made with Ookaya), Mudupu (Money bag), Duggani (Duga&#43;Kani=Two pies), Pavada (An offering as Bali), Etc. In the report of Stratton the following Telugu words were used :– Ookaya, Kanukalu, Varthana (Maintenance), Mangala Katta (Barbers’ bund), Mancham Seva or Panupu Seva (Repose worship), Addala Ara (Hall 10 of mirrors), Namala Angadi (Market of marking mud), Poola Bavi (Well used to deposit flowers), Nambi (One who worships god. This term was very widely used by both Mackenzie and Stratton). In both the above reports the following South Indian cognates were observed: Thiruvaradhana (Worship), Thomala Seva (A variety of worship). Vada (A hot cake), Poli (A sweet cake), Dosa (A flat pudding), Appam (A sweet flat pudding), Padi (A measure), Kani (A measure of land), etc. In Cox’s gazette the following words were used:Addakonda (The name of a hill), Muggu Bavi (A well or tank in the middle of the ascent of the hill), Gangalam (A wide-mouthed vessel), Poolangi (Flower decoration), Namala Guha (A cave, where white and red earth is found), etc, Zunnu Padi was endowed by Muru Raja Rama Raja Sripathi Obaleswara at about 1546 A.D. Zunnu is a Telugu term. All the traditional terms are Telugu terms but for a few Vaishnava technical terms of worship, introduced during the era of Sri Ramanuja. VENKATESWARA : The name of the deity on He is also called Venka- the hill is Venkateswara. tesa, Venkatachalapati. Venkataramana. Tiru- vengadaththan, etc. He is the Lord of the hill Venkata. The word Venkata is interpreted thus in Venkatachala Mahathmyam : 11 वेंकारोऽमृत बीजस्तु कटमैश्वर्य मुच्यते । अमृतैश्वर्य संघत्वा कटाद्रि रिति स्मृतः ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - लो. ३२. Vem = Eternal; Kata Bliss; Venkata = Eternal Bliss; the hill that conduces Eternal Bliss is called Venkatadri or Venkatachala and the Lord of such a hill is called Venkateswara. In another version, Vem Sin; Kata= Destroy or burn; Venkata= That which destroys or burns sins or purifier. Many authors are of opinion that these are not etymological. Sanskrit is so tightly knit that not a single word in it is left behind without an etymological origin. These interpretations are of Puranic origin only. They intend to support the supremacy of a particular deity in an idealistic way to convince the masses. The word Vengada is used by both the Andhras and Tamilians in common for Tirupati, but the etymological version is different. In the Andhra version it is Vengi Kada Vengada. ie. the boundary or limit of the territory called Vengi and ruled by the Andhra kings. In Tamil it is Ven&#43;Gadam Vengadam, meaning a white hill. Venkatachala is said to be of a molten gold colour and hence named Kanakachala. It was praised as such by many devotees of Andhra and Tamil culture. It is not mentioned to be white in 12 colour by any body anywhere. Therefore the word Vengadam is only a dialectal form of the Sanskrit term, Venkata, and not an independant Tamil word. Chandramana of Hindu calendar is observed by Andhras and the Souramana by Tamilians. Here on this hill in the shrine of Lord Venkateswara Chandramana is observed. New year’s Asthanam takes place on the Telugu new year’s day. Chandramana is in use upto and includnig Sesha. chala and Souraniana beyond and south of it, as per Jyothisha Siddhantha. SESHACHALA: SESHAGIRI: SESHADRI: SESHASAILA: These are all synonyms indicating the name of the hill, bearing reference to Sesha or the Adi Sesha. In Venkatachala Mahatınyam it is said. that Adi Sesha, in a conflict with Vayu, was blown off and deposited here. This Sesha is connected with Meru and Meru Puthra in the same Purana. This has a philosophical meaning, with special reference to the science of Yoga, which will be explained in the last chapter. BUSA NAGAPPADU is a pure Telugu term relating to Lord Venkateswara, indicating his origin to be that of a serpent, in virtue of his residence and identity with Seshadri and his emanating from an ant-hill. He is called Vyala Rupa in his one thousand names and it confirms this view. 13 SRISAILA: Srisaila and Venkatachala are synonyms. Srisaila is the original name of the hill, as illustrated in Venkatachala Mahatmya : श्रीपदत्वात् श्रियोवासात् शब्दशक्त्याच योगतः । रूढ्या श्रीशैल इत्येवं नामचास्य गिरेरभूत् ॥ वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - श्लो. ३४. Many authors quote a verse from Rigveda and attribute it to this Venkatachala. The early commentators Sayana and Yaska completely ignored this Venkatachala. Later authors commented Vikate Girim to be Venkatachala, attributing the word Sirim Bittasya to it. Sirim Bittasya is said to be Sree Peettasya. It means that the hill is an abode of Sree, which means Sree Chakra or the supreme Chakra, the Sahasrara. This version is in common vogue both in the Andhra and Tamil countries. We hear an Andhra call this deity “Edu Kondala Vadu” and a Tamilian call this deity “Elu Malai Appan”. This is not an outcome of or a translation of or a dialectal form of any original Sanskrit term, but an original South Indian term representing this hill to be seven in number in anology to the six Chakras and the seventh SahaThe establishment of the importance of this hill connected with the Sri Chakra is not limited srara. 14 only to South India, but extends to the whole of North India. Sri Chakra is a form of worship of Bala Tripura Sundari. Hence the North Indians call the hill and the deity “Balaji”. The Vaishnava commentary interpreted Sri to be the goddess Lakshmi, and the abode of which is Sri Nivasam. The latter term, when compounded means Vishnu, the lord of Lakshmi. But the term Sri Saila is in reference to a hill but not a deity thereupon. The derivative explanation of the term, relating to the deity, Venkata, is given quite seperately. If Sri is considered to be Lakshmi, Lakshmi-in some form or other should be the presiding deity there on the hill, irrespective of Vishnu. It is not so. There is no place seperately for either Lakshmi or any other Sree. A recent devotet connected with the management of the temple introduced “Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam”, which did not gain any importance nor achieve the aim with which it was introduced. One should try to understand the principle on which the consort is omitted to this Lord Venkateswara. This is explained by Yoga science in the last chapter. CONCLUSION: From a survey of traditional terminology, it is evident that all the terms are of Telugu origin. The area of the hill with its surrounding villages is purely Andhra, There are inscriptional evidences to show that many endow- 15 ments were made by Andhra kings, but it is a freak to note that such inscriptions are in Tamil. Inscriptions dating back to sixteenth century, ie. 1509. 1530 the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya and 1565-1684: the reign of Aravidu Rajas, appear in Tamil. It is believed that the heads of temple department then were Tamil Vaishnavaites, who took to inscriptional work in Tamil. There is no evidence to prove that Sri Krishna Deva Raya ever paid a visit to the temple of Govindaraja or that of Alamelumanga, nor that he endowed any thing to those temples. DEVOTEES OF REPUTE. Gopinatha is said to be the first Vaikhanasa, that worshipped Lord Venkateswara. He did penance on the hill and dedicated his life to Him. Ranga Doss was another devotee from Rangampeta. a village ten miles off from Tirupati, who dedicated his life to Lord Venkateswara. Both of them it is alleged were together doing service to god. They were supposed to be in the reign of King Sakhana of Kambhoja Desa. But historical evidences are not available. Ranga Doss was supplying flowers to god and Gopinath was worshipping god in very early days. Thallapaka Annamacharyulu was a devotee well known to all Andhra. He was born on a full16">

PREFACE.
I was brought by my father in my fifth year to Tirupati to have a Darshan of Lord Venkate
ever since I had an admiration and appretwo decades, resulting in Tirupati permanantly in
ciation for Him for over my settling down here at the year 1932. I wanted to guess what He stands for and what His message is in terms of Hindu philosophy. I came to a conclusion after twenty years. I felt it my duty to give out what 1 conceived and this booklet is its manifestation. I thank His Holi ness Sri Sri Mahant Narayanadossji Varu of Sr Hathiramji Mutt, Tirupati, who encouraged me in writing this booklet and patronised me in getting this published for the benefit of the public.
Publications under the title of &lsquo;History of Tirupati&rsquo; by sectarian authors gave an impetus to my quest and the latest publication &ldquo;Tirupati Sri Venkateswara&ndash;Balaji&rsquo; by Sri V. N. Srinivasa Rao was appeasing. I feel it my duty to offer my thank: to Sri V. N. Srinivasa Rao, who has dealt with the subject in detail in an impartial and nonsectarian way. My pen recorded only original views and failed to make mention of the history, chronologi-
2
cal sovereignty, religious endowments and the mode of administration relating to the shrine. I am a disciple of Ahobila Mutt and I believe in Vaishnavism but I do not belong to the fanatic school. I am of view that every Hindu has an equal claim to Lord Venkateswara and that even non-Hindus would someday or other devote themselves to Lord Venkateswara, who is an exponent of universal oneness of religion.
May Lord Venkateswara bless us all.
P. T. Jagannadha Rao
Dedicated to
Lord Venkateswara - Balaji.

TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY
:
TIRUPATI Tirupati is the name of the preent municipal town down the holy hill, on which Lord Venkateswara resides. The word Tirupati appears to be a dialectal form of some original Sanskrit word with some significance. In the English translation of some Malayalam manuscripts made at Chandragiri on 11-6-1802, with reference to the chronological account of sovereigns, references to this town were made as Tirupati and Teeroopaty, the latter also having the same pronunciation. But, in the report of Stratton, district collector, Chittoor, dated 31-1-1803, the hill proper was mentioned to be Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Pagoda and the village down was mentioned to be Tripatty village in all references of the report. In the Mackenzie collections, manuscript translations and reports, translated from Marati by Baboo Rao in 1804, Tripetty was the name given to this town. It is therefore to be inferred that the early part of the nineteenth century was the time for the recogni. tion of the transformation of &ldquo;Tri&rdquo; into &ldquo;Tiru This is often the case with Sanskrit terms in South India. The cause is simplicity and facility in pronunciation, as it appeals to masses. For instance, Trichinopoly or the present day Tiruchchirapalle
2
is the transformed dialect of the Sanskrit term. &ldquo;Tri Sirah Palle&rdquo;. So also Trinçumoly, which stands for Trikonagiri of Sanskrit or the present day Tirukkonamalai. In these cases the Sanskrit prefix &ldquo;Tri&rdquo; is transformed into &ldquo;Tiru&rdquo; to facilitate pronunciation. Similarly in the case of the word Tirupati also the prefix &ldquo;Tiru&rdquo; is the transformation of &ldquo;Tri&rdquo; of Sanskrit origin. The original word is &ldquo;TRIPATI&rdquo;. In the .details of Sri Venkatesa Ashta kshari Manthram, which is adopted in the routine worship of Lord Venkateswara. its Gayathri Manthram is given as below:&ndash; &ldquo;Venkatesaya Vidmahe, Tripati Nadhaya Dhimahi Thannah Srinivasah Prachodayath&rdquo;. This Ashtakshari Manthram is in vogue in the family of the author hereditarily. Lord Venkateswara is referred therein to be the Lord of Tripati. Tripati is the name of the hill. on which Lord Venkateswara resides.
Two centuries back this town Tirupati, down the hill was a small village. Fifteen centuries back there was no village at all down the hill, but a huge forest existed, extending all round the hill upto the Bay of Bengal in the east, upto the river Pinakini or Penna in the north, and a long distance in west and south, as per the Kaifiats of Kota, Chittivel, Chowdeswari Nandavanam and Talpagiri. Gradually with the growing importance of
3
Tirupati hill, a village down the hill emanated and developed into a town. The name of the hill extended to the village or town below, which mainly depended on the former&rsquo;s prosperity. Even today the public of Tirupati call the hill, UpTirupati, and the town, Down-Tirupati, the Telugu terms in vogue being &ldquo;Eguva
&ldquo;Eguva Tirupati &quot; and &ldquo;Diguva Tirupati &ldquo;. This has also reference to Stratton&rsquo;s report, which mentions the names of Tripatty Hill and Tripatty Village seperately.
The word Tirupati cannot be a dialectal form of Triputi❞ as interpreted by certain authors. There is no significance at all connected with the history of the place or the presiding deity. Nor is it derived from Sripati in a similar manner. The word Tirupati is a Telugu dialectal form and cannot be a Tamil one. In Tamil it should have been &ldquo;Tirubadi&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tiruppadi &ldquo;. These two forms are not at all found in any part of the history of Tirupati nor in any of the inscriptions in Tamil. The hill is mentioned to be &ldquo;Vengadam&rdquo; in all Tamil inscriptions. It is a dialectal form of &ldquo;Venkata&rdquo; of Sanskrit. Tirumala of Telugu and Tirumalai of Tamil are cognates, derived from the Sanskrit word &ldquo;Sri Saila&rdquo; which has reference in the concerned Puranas and the history of Tirupati. But these words are of a very recent origin, coined to create difference between the hill proper and the
4
town below it. It would not be even a century since these words were used. We do not find them
in ancient literature.
TIRUCHANUR: Tiruchanur is a small village
within three miles from Tirupati. dialectal form of the Sanskrit term The transformation is as follows:</h2>
<h2 id="sri-suka-puri--">Tiruchanur is a &ldquo;Sri Suka Puri&rdquo;.
Sri Suka Puri -</h2>
<h2 id="वकरऽमत-बजसत-कटमशवरय-मचयत--अमतशवरय-सघतव-कटदर-रत-समत-">Tiru Chugan Uru - Tiruchchuganur Tiruchchuhanur Tiruchanur. The railway station of this village is named &ldquo;Chiratanur&rdquo;. This is a result of metathesis according to philology. The word Tiruchchuganur is found in certain, inscriptionfrom Yogula Mallavaramu, an adjoining village of ancient repute. Sri Suka Puri is the place, where the famous saint Suka did penance and the two adjoining villages on either side of the river Swarnamukhi, namely Yogulamallavaramu and Munulapudi are pure unadulterated Telugu words with historic reference in vogue from time immemorial. By the side of Munulapudi is another village called Padipeta, renowned for its cattle wealth and Telugu origin.
A brief of this place, Tiruchanur, may not be out of place to an interested reader. Tiruchanui is now called Alamelumangapuram also. Alamelumanga Thayar or Padmavathi, alleged to be the consort of Lord Venkateswara, was installed in an
5
already existing temple at the time of Vaishnava (lomination. References from inscriptions denote an ancient temple. going by the name of &ldquo;Illan Koil at Tiruchanur. Illan Koil means the temple of the younger. Vaishnavaites interpret Illan to be Bala Krishna and Saivaites interpret Illan to be Bala Subrahmanya, as sung by ancient devotees. Illan Koil is not existing now at Tiruchanur. The present temple at Tiruchanur has a presiding deity. Lord Krishna, directly opposite to the main entrance and Alamelumanga is to a side. This is an evidence to prove that the installation of Alamc lumanga is very recent. Some inscribed stones referring to Illan Koil are found in the construction of the present temple. Some other such stones with inscriptions are found at the basement of resident houses. There was an Illan Koil of Saivaite importance at Tiruchanur before the seventh century, when Saivism thrived. But sub. sequently with the downfall of Saivism during the seventh century this temple was deserted and pulled down and the stones from it were used in the construction of the present temple. Such stones, bearing inscriptions, are noted by the iconographists. To attribute the antique repute of Illan Koil to Vaishnavism the present day temple was built with Krishna as the presiding deity to represent Illan. The worship at this temple is according to Pancha Ratra Agama and by Vaishnavas, whereas the6
worship at hill to Lord Venkateswara is according to Vaikhanasa Agama and by Vaikhanasas only.
Many Alwars referred to Krishna or Manavala Perumal of Tiruchanur in their songs, which do not offer any clue to the date and place of the deity. The deities at Tiruchanur are referred to in inscriptions as Tiruvilonkoil Perumanadigal, Tirumantrasalai Perumanadigal and Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal.
The main deity was Tiruvegatattu Perumanadigal, which was very much mistaken by many authors to be Lord Venkateswara on the hill These deities date back to the last quarter of the eighth century as per inscriptional authority. The Saivaite Illan Koil should have disappeared in the seventh century and the Vaishnavaite Illan Koil or Tiruvengatattu Perumanadigal should have come into existence early in the eighth century before the period of Sri Ramanuja itself. Inscriptional evidence of grants and endowments for the Akhandam to be maintained in this newly built temple is available. Even today an author interprets Illan Koil to be Snapana Mantapa of Lord Venkateswara
on the hill with a motive.
Very early Alwars did not visit Lord Venkateswara, but described him in their prayers to be a blend of Hari and Hara. In the tenth century Nammalwar ascended the hill and prayed Lord
7
Venkateswara to be the embodiment of the Omni.
present Vishnu. He consecrated a silver image at about 966 A.D. in the temple on the hill and called it Manavala Perumal. There is a difference of about two centuries between the consecration of a Vaishnava temple at Tiruchanur and the first Alwar to ascend the hill to consecrate a Vaishnava image on the hill. Many Alwars abstained from ascending the hill to worship Lord Venkateswara for fear that the deity was a Siva with Saivaite. paraphernalia. Customarily some turmeric and Kumkum is used to be sent from the hill to Tiruchanur during the annual festival at the latter. But there is no inscriptional evidence to prove it to be an ancient one. Silappadikaram, an oft quoted authority, the antiquity of which was dated back to about 756 A.D. by Dr. Swamikannu, does not tell. us that the hill was sacred nor does it say when the god manifested himself there. But the same authority corroborates the facts given above in respect of the deities consecrated at Tiruchanur.
ALIPIRI: This is the name, by which the foot of the hill, from where the route to the hill commences, is called. Alipiri is a pure Telugu word, meaning miniature. It means that Lord Venkateswara in his miniature form dwells there to give Darshan to his non-caste-hindu devotees, who were forbidden in those days to ascend the hill. Mala-
8
vani Gundam is a pure Telugu term. It is close to Alipiti.
That portion of
GOVINDARAJA PATTANA: Tirupati, where Lord Govindaraja is consecrated, Is called Govindaraja Pattana. Inspite of its existence from the year 1050 A.D., when Tiruverenda Yadavarayalu reigned and got Govindaraja consecrated, the whole town Tirupati is universally called Tirupati only.
CHANDRAGIRI: This is a village six miles off from Tirupati. It is of historic importance with an old fort and remnants of scientific materials, which conduct the gong sound from the Venkatadri hill to Chandragiri fort. Archaelogical findings of Jain importance are also found there. The original name is traditionally maintained in its Telugu form. In Tamil it should have been called Sandira Malai, but such a term is absent. This is supposed to have come into existence at about 1330 A.D. from the time of Saluva Mangi Deva.
THEERTHAMS: All the Theerthams of Puranic importance on and around the hill, connected with the shrme of Lord Venkateswara, have retained heir original names in Sanskrit, such as Kapila Theertham, Bheema Theertham, Gogarbham, Pandava Theertham, Akasa Ganga, Papanasanam.
9
Sesha Theertham, Ramakrishna Theertham, Thumburu Theertham, etc. There are some Theerthams, which bear pure Telugu names, such as Pasupu Theertham and Seethamma Theertham. All the names, connected with the different parts of the hill and forest around this hill, are of pure Telugu language, as inferred from any map of this hill. The words Vagu, Vanka and Kona are widely used in such terminology.
TRADITIONAL TELUGU WORDS IN USE: The following pure Telugu words were used in the time of Mackenzie in 1803 A.D.:Kuruvá Dova (Hill path), Padikavali (Gateman), Bangaru Vakili (Gold entrance), Koppera (Hundi), Gudi (Temple), Thotti Theertham (Holy water of the tub), Koluvu (Durbar), Alavattam (Fan), Parasa (Pilgrim), Kanuka (Offering), Cherupu (Food - derived from the word Cherava, meaning a wide-mouthed vessel in which food is made to offer to god), Laddu (A round pudding), Sukiya (A sweet preparation), Thena Thola (Another sweet preparation), Ookaya Pachchadi (A dish made with Ookaya), Mudupu (Money bag), Duggani (Duga+Kani=Two pies), Pavada (An offering as Bali), Etc. In the report of Stratton the following Telugu words were used :&ndash; Ookaya, Kanukalu, Varthana (Maintenance), Mangala Katta (Barbers&rsquo; bund), Mancham Seva or Panupu Seva (Repose worship), Addala Ara (Hall
10
of mirrors), Namala Angadi (Market of marking mud), Poola Bavi (Well used to deposit flowers), Nambi (One who worships god. This term was very widely used by both Mackenzie and Stratton). In both the above reports the following South Indian cognates were observed: Thiruvaradhana (Worship), Thomala Seva (A variety of worship). Vada (A hot cake), Poli (A sweet cake), Dosa (A flat pudding), Appam (A sweet flat pudding), Padi (A measure), Kani (A measure of land), etc. In Cox&rsquo;s gazette the following words were used:Addakonda (The name of a hill), Muggu Bavi (A well or tank in the middle of the ascent of the hill), Gangalam (A wide-mouthed vessel), Poolangi (Flower decoration), Namala Guha (A cave, where white and red earth is found), etc, Zunnu Padi was endowed by Muru Raja Rama Raja Sripathi Obaleswara at about 1546 A.D. Zunnu is a Telugu term. All the traditional terms are Telugu terms but for a few Vaishnava technical terms of worship, introduced during the era of Sri Ramanuja.
VENKATESWARA : The name of the deity on He is also called Venka-
the hill is Venkateswara.
tesa, Venkatachalapati.
Venkataramana.
Tiru-
vengadaththan, etc. He is the Lord of the hill Venkata. The word Venkata is interpreted thus in Venkatachala Mahathmyam :
11
वेंकारोऽमृत बीजस्तु कटमैश्वर्य मुच्यते । अमृतैश्वर्य संघत्वा कटाद्रि रिति स्मृतः ॥</h2>
<h1 id="वरह-परण-अधय-३६---ल-३२">वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - लो. ३२.</h1>
<p>Vem = Eternal; Kata Bliss; Venkata = Eternal Bliss; the hill that conduces Eternal Bliss is called Venkatadri or Venkatachala and the Lord of such a hill is called Venkateswara. In another version, Vem Sin; Kata= Destroy or burn; Venkata= That which destroys or burns sins or purifier. Many authors are of opinion that these are not etymological. Sanskrit is so tightly knit that not a single word in it is left behind without an etymological origin. These interpretations are of Puranic origin only. They intend to support the supremacy of a particular deity in an idealistic way to convince the masses. The word Vengada is used by both the Andhras and Tamilians in common for Tirupati, but the etymological version is different. In the Andhra version it is Vengi Kada Vengada. ie. the boundary or limit of the territory called Vengi and ruled by the Andhra kings. In Tamil it is Ven+Gadam Vengadam, meaning a white hill. Venkatachala is said to be of a molten gold
colour and hence named Kanakachala.
It was praised as such by many devotees of Andhra and Tamil culture. It is not mentioned to be white in
12
colour by any body anywhere. Therefore the word Vengadam is only a dialectal form of the Sanskrit term, Venkata, and not an independant Tamil word. Chandramana of Hindu calendar is observed by Andhras and the Souramana by Tamilians. Here on this hill in the shrine of Lord Venkateswara Chandramana is observed. New year&rsquo;s Asthanam takes place on the Telugu new year&rsquo;s day. Chandramana is in use upto and includnig Sesha. chala and Souraniana beyond and south of it, as per Jyothisha Siddhantha.
SESHACHALA: SESHAGIRI: SESHADRI: SESHASAILA: These are all synonyms indicating the name of the hill, bearing reference to Sesha or the Adi Sesha. In Venkatachala Mahatınyam it is said. that Adi Sesha, in a conflict with Vayu, was blown off and deposited here. This Sesha is connected with Meru and Meru Puthra in the same Purana. This has a philosophical meaning, with special reference to the science of Yoga, which will be explained in the last chapter. BUSA NAGAPPADU is a pure Telugu term relating to Lord Venkateswara, indicating his origin to be that of a serpent, in virtue of his residence and identity with Seshadri and his emanating from an ant-hill. He is called Vyala Rupa in his one thousand names and it confirms this view.

SRISAILA: Srisaila and Venkatachala are synonyms. Srisaila is the original name of the hill, as illustrated in Venkatachala Mahatmya :
श्रीपदत्वात् श्रियोवासात् शब्दशक्त्याच योगतः । रूढ्या श्रीशैल इत्येवं नामचास्य गिरेरभूत् ॥
वराह पुराणे अध्या. ३६ - श्लो. ३४.
Many authors quote a verse from Rigveda and attribute it to this Venkatachala. The early commentators Sayana and Yaska completely ignored this Venkatachala. Later authors commented Vikate Girim to be Venkatachala, attributing the word Sirim Bittasya to it. Sirim Bittasya is said to be Sree Peettasya. It means that the hill is an abode of Sree, which means Sree Chakra or the supreme Chakra, the Sahasrara. This version is in common vogue both in the Andhra and Tamil countries. We hear an Andhra call this deity &ldquo;Edu Kondala Vadu&rdquo; and a Tamilian call this deity &ldquo;Elu Malai Appan&rdquo;. This is not an outcome of or a translation of or a dialectal form of any original Sanskrit term, but an original South Indian term representing this hill to be seven in number in anology to the six Chakras and the seventh SahaThe establishment of the importance of this hill connected with the Sri Chakra is not limited
srara.
14
only to South India, but extends to the whole of North India. Sri Chakra is a form of worship of Bala Tripura Sundari. Hence the North Indians call the hill and the deity &ldquo;Balaji&rdquo;. The Vaishnava commentary interpreted Sri to be the goddess Lakshmi, and the abode of which is Sri Nivasam. The latter term, when compounded means Vishnu, the lord of Lakshmi. But the term Sri Saila is in reference to a hill but not a deity thereupon. The derivative explanation of the term, relating to the deity, Venkata, is given quite seperately. If Sri is considered to be Lakshmi, Lakshmi-in some form or other should be the presiding deity there on the hill, irrespective of Vishnu. It is not so. There is no place seperately for either Lakshmi or any other Sree. A recent devotet connected with the management of the temple introduced &ldquo;Lakshmi Devi Mahotsavam&rdquo;, which did not gain any importance nor achieve the aim with which it was introduced. One should try to understand the principle on which the consort is omitted to this Lord Venkateswara. This is explained by Yoga science in the last chapter.
CONCLUSION: From a survey of traditional terminology, it is evident that all the terms are of Telugu origin. The area of the hill with its surrounding villages is purely Andhra, There are inscriptional evidences to show that many endow-
15
ments were made by Andhra kings, but it is a freak to note that such inscriptions are in Tamil. Inscriptions dating back to sixteenth century, ie. 1509. 1530 the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya and 1565-1684: the reign of Aravidu Rajas, appear in Tamil. It is believed that the heads of temple department then were Tamil Vaishnavaites, who took to inscriptional work in Tamil. There is no evidence to prove that Sri Krishna Deva Raya ever paid a visit to the temple of Govindaraja or that of Alamelumanga, nor that he endowed any thing to those temples.
DEVOTEES OF REPUTE.
Gopinatha is said to be the first Vaikhanasa, that worshipped Lord Venkateswara. He did penance on the hill and dedicated his life to Him. Ranga Doss was another devotee from Rangampeta. a village ten miles off from Tirupati, who dedicated his life to Lord Venkateswara. Both of them it is alleged were together doing service to god. They were supposed to be in the reign of King Sakhana of Kambhoja Desa. But historical evidences are not available. Ranga Doss was supplying flowers to god and Gopinath was worshipping god in very early days.

Different preceptors from different places had their own commandments, which were controversial materially but had the same spiritual ultimate aim. The cultured aimed at the goal but the masses laid more stress on the material aspects than the spiritual. This was the stage of religion in India in the early centuries A.D. Egotism was prevailing with the vanishing psychism. Idealistic preceptors with cheap commandments preached Buddhism and Jainism to check the fall of psychism and elevate masses to introspection. Both these religions were in their bloom in the fifth, sixth and seventh centnries A.D. Sankaracharya propogated Vedic religion in contrast to Buddhism and Jainism.

Buddhism and Jainism had no status. They had to disappear from the battle field. Let us consider the South Indian situation in connection with the temple and hill of Lord Venkateswara. As a token of Pallavas encouraging all religions, we see even today a Jain temple at Arungulam, five miles from Tiruttani. And as a token of the subsequent keen rivalry we see at Nallattur, a village very near Tiruttani, idols of Vishnu and Siva deserted and kept on the ridges of cultivated lands, being dug out of the same lands.

Lord Venkateswara might have been called by that name - Adimooleswar - by Jains during their regime. They do not have temples for the consorts. They are always single. As Jainism faded there was none to claim this deity. The controversy is between the Saivaites and the Vaishnavaites only, leaving behind all other religions. The period of Jain regime was the transitional period. Pre-Jain period was Saivaite and the post-Jain period was Vaishnavaite. Yadava families of various branches adopted Jainism.

In this connection Lord Venkateswara has his own Manthram. It is an Ashtakshari composed of eight letters, initiated by Narada vide Brahmanda Purana. There are two more Manthrams, Navakshari and Ashtakshari of the same deity initiated by Siva, vide Bhavishyothara Purana - Sri Venkateswara Rahasya. In all these Manthrams the name of the deity is given as VENKATESA only. It is a compound word, Venkata+Esa Venkatesa. The latter word is a Saiva term not at all used by Vaishnavaites in their terminology or nomencalture. No Vaishnavaite does possess a name as Venkatesa wholly with the word Esa. The Sahasra-Namas of this deity begin with the same term &ldquo;Venkatesaya Namah&rdquo;. In the Dhyana Sloka given by Narada, all the paraphernalia of Vishnu is given but not accounted for in the idol. In the Dhyana Sloka given by Siva the Moorthi or idol is described to have a Srivatsam on the right side of the chest and adorned by a Naga-</h1>
27
bhushana, which identifies the idol very clearly. The description in a Dhyana Sloka may vary with the author, but the Manthram will not on any account vary. Such instances are not wanting in
Manthra Sastra.</li>
<li>The original idol has a Nagabharana. A serpent is seen carved on the idol as a decoration. This is a specific ornament to Siva and other Saiva deities. Not a single form of Vishnu anywhere is adorned by a Nagabharana.</li>
<li>In the month of Dhanus, the ninth solar month, this deity is worshipped specially with Bilwa leaf for all the thirty days. Bilwa is specially indicated in the worship of Siva and condemned totally by Vaishnavaites. It is still a wonder, why Vaishnavaites condemn Bilwa, under which tree goddess Lakshmi is expected to be.</li>
<li>This idol of Venkateswara has a Jata, plaited hair. Jatajutum is akin to Lord Siva. &ldquo;Swachcha Mouli Sobha Virajithaya Namah&rdquo; is one of his one thousand names of worship.</li>
<li>Pilgrims, visiting Saiva shrines, get shaved customarily, as is usual at Palani, Tiruttani, etc. So also getting shaved is a custom at Tirupati hill. It is not so at any Vaishnavaite shrine.
28</li>
<li>In the sanctum sanctorum the idol is installed at the centre, leaving much space behind. This is always the custom with Saiva idols. In case of Vishnu idols the idol is installed close to the back wall, leaving large space in front of the idol. There is an unusual vacant space behind Lord Venkateswara.</li>
<li>All round Tirupati for about a radius of fifty miles, ancient Siva temples are seen, with their respective legends and allusions - Puranas. Kalahasti, Tiruttani, Takkolam, Tiruvelangadu, Thondavada, etc. are places of Siva temples with antiquity. Talakona, Kailasakona, Sadasivakona, etc. are places of water-falls of Saivaite importance and Puranic antiquity. The other Vaishnava temples found in the proximity of this shrine of Venkateswara are connected with the main shrine by some Purana or imitation, and are consecrated during or after the twelfth century or the era of Sri Ramanuja.</li>
<li>On Sivarathri day, dedicated specially to the worship of Siva, all the Archakas and staff of the temple of Lord Venkateswara go to the Kshetra Palakas and perform Abhishekam according to Saiva form of worship. Probably this is a traceable remnant of some previous grand function at the temple proper, but neglected and transferred after
29
the twelfth century. Vaishnava authors of History of Tirupati prefer to omit every thing about Kshetra-Palakas or state that the worship of such Kshetra-Palakas is not traditional and that it is not supported by inscriptional evidence. This worship is even to-day being continued by the temple authorities traditionally.</li>
<li>Every Tuesday Smartha Saivaites offer food Naivedyam to Kshetra-Palakas and offer the Prasadam to Jeeyangars. The latter being staunch Vaishnavaites ungrudgingly receive the Prasadam. As this tradition could not have been introduced after the establishment of Jeeyars at the hill, ie. 1387 A.D., it should be presumed that it was in vogue even earlier than the fourteenth century. It might have been connected with the original deity and performed in a magnificient manner in the early days of Saivaite climax and got neglected and transferred subsequently. In this connection
mention may be made of a similar function at Ahobilam. A Siva Lingam is consecrated in the walled-off portion of the natural cavern, in which Narasimha is worshipped. The Lingam is behind the Narasimha. A special worship by Smarthas, akin to that at this Venkatachala Kshetra, is conducted on the Sivarathri day. Vaishnava domination attenuated the Saiva importance, leaving behind the relic. Such is the worship of Kshetra-
30
Palakas on Venkatachalam and the observance of the Vinayaka Chaturdhi and Varalakshmi Vratham along with routine worship.</li>
<li>On Vinayaka Chaturdhi day, a special pudding, Kudumu, very much relished by Ganapathi or Vinayaka, the son of Siva, is prepared and offered to Lord Venkateswara. The preparation of such a pudding on Vinayaka Chaturdhi day is a custom in Saivism. It is not at all observed by Vaishnavaites. This might be another remnant of an antique dignified form of worship, attennuated by time and transition.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>This
Similarly Vara Lakshmi Vratham is adopted in this shrine of Lord Venkateswara. Vratham is mostly observed by Saivaites.
12. On the northern side of the ridge of the base of the Lord&rsquo;s Vimana in gold, there is still a remnant of Saivaite art, depicting Markandeya embracing Lord Siva in his Lingam form. Such an architecture cannot be found on any place in a Vaishnavaite temple.
13. The person who is deputed to read the calendar daily is a Saivaite.
The person who bears the umbrella is a Saivaite. The person who does Kanyadanam in Kalyanotsava is a Saivaite - Thallapaka representative or a Vaikhanasa. The routine worship is done by Saivaites, called Vaikha-
31
nasas. These are Smarthas, the only persons who have the right of touch, decoration, Abhishekam and worship in all forms. This is hereditory and traditional. Vaikhanasa Munisreshta Pujithayanamah is one of his names. The mode of worship here is according to Vaikhanasa Agama, but the mode of worship in Vaishnava temples is according to Pancharatra Agama.
14. Venkatadri is described in several Saiva Puranas, such as Siva Rahasya Khanda, etc. to be the abode of Lord Subrahmanya, son of Lord Siva. Subrahmanya, being a bachelor, is said to be single without a consort. The tank attached close to the shrine is called by the name &ldquo;Swami Pushkarini &quot; and claimed to have been named after Kumara Swami. Any way it cannot be after the name of the Swami of the temple, as we see the deity is called &ldquo;Swami Dhyeyayanamah and &ldquo;Swami
Theertha Krithavasayanamah.&rdquo;
and
15. Lord Venkateswara is said to be a blend of Vishnu and Subrahmanya, from the fact that he is called &ldquo;Karthikeya Vapu Dharine Namah. Karthikeya is Subrahmanya. It means that Lord Venkateswara assumed the form of Subrahmanya. This version is confirmed by the allusion given in Vratha Chudamani text under Sanivara Vratha. The special form of worship or ritual to be performed on Saturdays, considered to be very import-
32
ant to Lord Venkateswara, is specific to the blended form of Vishnu and Subrahmanya. It is alleged that Vishnu and Subrahmanya worshipped Lord Siva, called Venkata, on this hill and became united with one mind to confer boons to all devotees. In this connection it may be recalled that Lord Venkateswara emanated from an Ant-hill. Snake is one of the forms of Subrahmanya. From this analogy Lord Venkateswara is considered to be Subrahmanya.
16. According to Uttarakamikagama every Siva idol is expected not to exhibit its feet. In several cases the feet, ankles and a portion below the knees are not to be seen, as they are underground. In this case of Lord Venkateswara the feet are underground and not seen. This point is referred to in Varaha Purana - Venkatachala Mahatmya second part - chapter IX thus:

Gold plated feet are placed at the bottom of the idol for exhibition for the sake of the masses.
17. In Brahmanda Purana one thousand names are given to Lord Venkateswara. The list is called Sahasra Namavali. The first one is Venkatesa and the immediate next one is Virupaksha, a name of Siva. There are several names
33
of Siva appearing in the list. They are:Virupakshaya, Kalakantthaya, Sambhave, Paresaya, Ugraya, Maheswaraya, Kapaline, Pasine, Sooline, Kuttharine, Digvastraya, Kamari, Bhavaya, Kapardine, Kapilaya, Layaya, Maha Nataya, Niranjanaya, Urdhwa Lingaya, Purandaraya, Nagesaya, Hanthre, Apataya, Sivankaraya, Bilwamala Jala Snayine, Sthanu-Sthaya, Swachchamouli Sobha Virajithaya, Vakra Danshtrine, Karala Vakthraya, Jwala Karala Vadanaya, etc.
More than fifty percent of the total names apply equally to Vishnu and Siva by virtue of their literal derivations. Generally the above mentioned Saiva terms do not appear in the Vishnu Sahasranamavali.
Saivaites claim the deity to be their goddess also. The following points are in support of their claim:
18. In every temple the top corners of the compound wall bear the emblem of the presiding deity. In this case of Lord Venkateswara, the emblem is a couchant lion. There is no analogy to this freak.
Lion is the emblem of a Saiva goddess or Sakthi everywhere.
19. The very important anniversary festival of Lord Venkateswara takes place in Solar Kanya Masa during Navarathri days, specially dedicated to the worship of a Sakthi or goddess or Sri Chakra.
34
20. The idol of Lord Venkateswara is bathed in turmeric water every friday, which act is customary with ladies and goddesses.
21. Pavada or Tiruppavada is offered to Lord Venkateswara after the completion of the anniversary festival as a finishing touch. Pavada is a huge quantity of food coloured red, placed in a heap with Margosa leaves before the deity and offered as Bali. This appears to be a substitute to animal slaughter and food mixed with blood as offered to a Sakthi in the way of Bali. The change is said to have occured during the Jain regime.
22. This idol of Lord Venkateswara is similar to the Durga idol at Tiruvanjikalam, Malabar district, which bears the disc and conch by the hind arms, the fore pair being in the Katyavalambitha and Varada poses. The cloth worn by that goddess is the same Peethambaram.
23. All the North Indians call this deity &ldquo;Balaji&rdquo;, a revered form of Bala Tripura Sundari or Sakthi. They have taken this word from the tradition that this idol and hill represent Sri Chakra.
24. In Varaha Purana it is said that Thondaman was led by a parrot to a huntsman and that the latter introduced Thondaman to his deity, Venkateswara, who was under a Bilwa tree. This incident identifies the affinity of Lord Venkateswara
35
to Bilwa, much revered by the Saivaites, Goddess Lakshmi has her abode under a Bilwa tree. This version of Purana might have been even coined to suit the quotation from Veda &ldquo;Sree Peettasya= Sri Nivasasya&rdquo;. Here Sri means Bilwa.
25. In the prayer of Sankaracharya, Dwadasa Linga Stawam, he describes the deities on the hills of Sri Saila and Seshadri to be Lord Siva only. (Arjunam Mallika Poorvam)
26. Lord Venkateswara is also claimed to be a blend of Hari-Hara. Saivaites have no objection to worship Vishnu but Vaishnavaites take objection to recognise any form of Siva in their worship and Under unavoidable circumstances and in prayer. the presence of facts early Alwars prayed Lord Venkateswara to be a blend of Vishnu and Siva. In the iconography written by T. Gopinatha Rao it is stated that in about 700 A.D. Peyalwar described Lord Venkateswara to be in the form of a Vishnu and Siva or Hari and Hara in his Tirukkanden. Similarly in a book of Pasurams published by the Srivaishnava Mudrapaka Sabha Limited in 1901 A.D. a Pasuram bears the following meaning:
&ldquo;On the hill with sacred brooks is the Lord, who has a hanging Jata, long crown, nice axe, a disc and a snake. It is astonishing to find a blend of Hari and Hara in one form here.&rdquo; The early Alwars prayed Lord Venkateswara as a blend of36
Hari and Hara and the later Alwars tried to establish Lord Venkateswara to be Vishnu alone, by introducing certain Vaishnavaite forms of worship on compromise.
THE VAISHNAVA CLAIM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sri Vatsam on the chest is a Vaishnava mark. Usually the Sri Vatsam will be on the left side of the chest of Vishnu. But in this case it is on the right side of the chest. Right-sided Sri Vatsam is a mark of Jains. We do not find a single instance of Vishnu having the Sri Vatsam on the right side of the chest.</li>
<li>Peethambaram worn by the deity refers to Vishnu. Peethambara is worn by Sakthi and Vaishnavi goddess. Bagala has a Peethambara. On Thursdays Lord Venkateswara is decorated with a saree and plenty of flowers. A big sword is attached to the waist, to resemble a Sakthi.</li>
<li>The Namam on the face is a Vaishnava mark. This Namam is neither Vadagal nor Thengal. This is not marked with the white and red substances usually. But refined camphor and musk are used. A Namam may appear on any face at the will of the worshipper. For instance at Tiruchanur a Vaishnava family found an idol of Ganapati in their premises, installed it in a small temple with a Namam on its face and named it Thumbikalwar. It is wondered in what history did
37
Ganapati become a Vaishnavaite to wear a Namam on his face.</li>
<li>The method of worship adopted on the hill to this deity is according to Vaikhanasa Agama, where Purusha Sooktham is observed, Purusha Sooktham is not an exclusive Vaishnava portion. It is used by all. It is not an exception to Saivaites in contrast to Rudram.</li>
<li>The wearing of a disc and a conch by this deity is a special Vaishnava feature. They are after all artificially attached, and do not disclose the real nature of the deity. They may be as genuine as the artificial gold plate feet. According to Purana Thondaman requested Lord Venkateswara to give him the disc and conch. His request was granted. Thereafter Lord Venkateswara is supposed to have worn artificial disc and conch to please the masses. This point gives room for suspicion. In Pasurams Lord Venkateswara is described to have held in his hands an axe and a disc. Axe is a Saiva emblem. Disc is a Vaishnava emblem. To make the deity wholly Vaishnavaite gold plate disc and conch were fitted to the hands. The artificial disc fitted tightly but the conch supposed to have been fitted to the axe had a shake. Another gold plate conch was fitted on to the already existing one in the year 1800 A.D. by the then Archaka, Srinivasa Dikshitulu, spending about 500 pagodas of gold, as per available evidences.
38
CONCLUSION: Let us have an impartial survey of facts. Puranas relating to a particular deity establish, the supremacy of that deity over all the rest. Such Puranic references are to be discounted. All differences in the method of decoration and worship are man-made, hence to be discounted. Let the nude deity be studied in detail.
FEET: The feet being underground the idol is Siva; the presence of Viraja spring at the feet identifies the idol to be Vishnu.
CHEST: Nagabharanam is an emblem of Siva; Sri Vatsam is an emblem of Vishnu.
HEAD: The Jata signifies Siva; the crown signifies Vishnu.
It is therefore evident that this deity is a blend of Hari and Hara, but not a Siva or Vishnu exclusively.

APPENDIX.
Extract from the Government publication of the North Arcot District Mannual, 1880 edition, report of Mr. A. F. Cox.
&ldquo;There can be no reasonable doubt that originally the idol was worshipped as Siva. This is denied by none and the story goes that Ramanujachari asserting that it was all a mistake, and that the Swami was Vishnu, procured a Chank and Chakram of gold, which he placed before the image and closed the temple doors. When they were next day opened, these ensigns were found grasped in the idol&rsquo;s hands, which was regarded as a proof that he was Vishnu. The Chank and Chakram are not portions of the stone image, but are made of gold and fitted upon the two hands which point upwards. The arrangement of the hair as Jata or tangled mass, the cobras carved upon the body and various other peculiarities prove that Siva was intended to be represented and the priests who are Dikshidars say that they are Saivaites, though they wear Namam. Probably, the Swami who has no consort on the hill was the bachelor Subrahmanyaswami.&rdquo;
CONCLUSION.
The Hindu mythology is so intellectually depicted that it suits the masses and the cultured as well. Every branch of it expounds both the materialistic and spiritualistic (Sthula and Sookshma) aspects. It is understood by the reader according to his receiving capacity. Idolatry is intended for the masses to educate them in the line of devotion. The innate and absolute divinity is realised by the cultured by inference. Selfish worship or bigoted idolatry is fanatic and idealistic, as it carries with it a motive. If the student of religion were to adhere to the elementary principles of Yama and Niyama, which purify the mind, he would naturally develop to be selfless in his worship. Selfless idolatry tends to generate a quest for truth. Selfless research in religion is realistic and philosophical. Truth is known by such persistant meditation. One who seeks after truth attains several psychic powers even if he fails to realise the absolute Brahman. One who practises attainment of perfection or Siddhi will not be a loser if he fails. He will be à Bhogi, enjoying perfect physical health, instead of a Yogi, enjoying selfrealisation. One who practises alchemy will be a good pharmacist if he fails to become an alchemist.

Nothing is lost in any of the Hindu mythological practices. There is certainly a development perceived in proportion to the practice.
So every
person should aim high to realise the Lord within himself, without prejudice to idolatry, which is intended for those, who have not yet developed a desire for such a goal. Lord Venkateswara is presented in the form of a Hindu mythological deity but he represents the One. He sheds the religious rivalry between the Vaishnavaites and Saivaites ;
he incorporates Mlechhas (noncaste hindus) into his fold and he imparts the universal religious oneness to all religions alike. In chapter fifty-eight of Venkatachala Mahatmya of Varaha Purana, it is said that Lord Venkateswara gives audience or Darshan to Mlechhas and that even Muslims would attend his festivals at the hill along with Hindus.
Every term, relating to Lord Venkateswara. has a Yogic attribute and every allusion, relating to Him, has a reference to Yoga science. In Brahma Purana a detailed allusion of a contest between Vayu and Sesha, resulting in the existence of this hill is given. Sesha challenged Vayu for a contest. Sesha twisted his body around a portion of Meru, called Meru-Puthra, glittering in a molten gold colour and asked Vayu to lift it up. Instigated by Lord Hari, Vayu filled all the worlds with wind.
42
Sesha unfolded his hood having become light with wind. Through that space Vayu entered in and lifted up Meru-Puthra which was coiled by Sesha along with Sesha himself. Sesha was defeated and Vayu won. According to Yoga science, Meru is Meru Danda or the vertebral column, through which the physiological spinal cord and the psychological subtile Nadis, such as Sushumna, pass. Spinal cord is visible to the naked eye, but the latter is only realised by Yoga practice. MeruPuthra is the Adhomukha Swayambhu Lingam situated in the Mooladhara Kamala Karnika, ie. in the first of the six Chakras, with his head turned down. Sesha represents Kundalini Sakthi. This Lingam is coiled by Kundalini Sakthi by three and a half rounds and his face or Brahma Nadi Mukham is closed by its hood. This Lingam is of a molten gold colour. A practitioner of Yoga takes in a deep and full breath, fills the whole body with it, pulls up the anus and Apana Vayu which unfurls the coils, loosens the face of the Kundalini Sakthi covering the Brahma Nadi Vivaram or the Swayambhu Linga Chhidra, turns up the Adhomukha Linga and forces the Kundalini Sakthi pass through the Brahma Nadi to Sahasrara to realise the almighty Paramatman. According to Brahma Purana Meru-Puthra is Venkatachala hill. By its molten gold colour it is called Kanakachala. Therefore Venkatachalam is the Oordhwa Mukha
43
Swayambhu Linga with Prabodhitha Kundalini Sakthi. Andhras and Tamilians have well recognised this aspect of Venkatachala and call the hill to be Edu Kondalu or Elu Malai, meaning seven hills. The first six hills represent the six Chakras from Mooladhara to Ajna and the seventh hill is the Sahasrara, which is the abode of Paramatman absolute. The mind stops with Ajna Chakra and the absolute Paramatman resides in the Sahasrara.
In the Anganyasa of Sri Venkatesa Ashtakshari Manthram it is said &ldquo;Venkatesah Paramatma Devathethi Sirasi &ldquo;. Venkatesa is taken to be the Paramatman absolute. Though the hill is illustrated to be seven in number and though the Chakras are six plus one in number, in Hamsopanishad it is clearly stated that these are only different stages or aspects of the One. Yoga begins with the Mooladhara and gets perfected at Sahasrara. Kundalini Sakthi begins at Mooladhara and reaches Sahasrara. The Chakras denote different stages of ascent and perfection. So also Venkatachala is one hill, but illustrated to be seven in number for analogy. Therefore Lord Venkateswara, represented to be the Swayambhu Linga of Mooladhara, is also the Paramatman of the Sahasrara. One who ascends the hill Venkatadri loses his Jeevathvam there and returns blessed with Devathvam. He loses his seli there and returns blessed with Amritha. Amritha
44
is obtained from Viraja at the feet of Lord Venkateswara. Viraja is said to be a stream of Amritha with reference to its existence at Vaikunttha. This has reference in Mundakopanishad and Syamapaddhathi. In Venkatachala Mahatmyam it is described that Lord Venkateswara is a physician and that the holy water of Swami Pushkarini is medicine.
The site of Venkatachala is called Varaha Kshetra. He is Bhoo-Varaha. The first Chakra, Mooladhara, represents earth. It is of Bhoo-Thathwam. Varaha is the saviour of Bhoo according to mythological legends. The importance of the first Mooladhara Chakra is depicted by calling the site to be the Varaha Kshetra. Varaha Bijam is HUM. It is otherwise called Kurchika Bija also, with the aid of which Kundalini Sakthi is made to ascend from Mooladhara to Sahasrara according to many Tantrik texts. Chapter one, part two of Sri Varaha Purana deals with Dharani Varaha Samvada, in which it is said that Dharani (Kundalini of Mooladhara) attended by her two maids, Ida and Pingala, prayed to Varaha by thanking him for having lifted her up and made her seated at the Sahasrara. In the twenty-eighth chapter, Ashtanga Yoga Nirupana, of the first part of Sri Varaha Purana, Yoga practice with Venkatesa Ashtakshari is given.
41
Padmavathi Devi, the alleged consort of Lord Venkateswara, is said to be the daughter of Akasa Raja and Dharani Devi. The parents represent the first five Chakras of the five elements, ie. from Mooladhara to Visudha. Mooladhara represents earth and hence it is Dharani Devi. Visudha represents Akasa and hence it is Akasa Raja. The mind is with them all along these five Chakras. It has a seperate existence in Ajna Chakra, the sixth. As it gets out of the five elemental Chakras and obtains an individuality it is called a daughter and named to be Padmavathi, representing the mind or conscience. The Jeeva will be conscious of his practice and he will have his mind active as far as he makes Kundalini Sakthi ascend Ajna Chakra. Above Ajna Chakra there is a place called Unmani, where the mind is lost and the practitioner becomes unconscious of himself. Therefore the mind is lost before the Jeeva enters Sahasrara or attains perfection in Yoga Samadhi. It is therefore that Lord Venkateswara has no consort with him at this temple. He is the Parabrahman absolute. Some authors say that the Paramatman absolute is a blend of Paramatman and Prakriti. To he has a Sri Vatsam.
prove this
Lord Venkateswara is called Tripathi Nadha. He is the embodiment of the three Bindus of the Parama Bindu at Sahasrara, representing the three-
46
gods – Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara; the three Gunas Sattwa, Rajas and Thamas and the three holy letters-A U M constituting the Pranava. At Sahasrara the supreme one has no form. He is free from dualism. He is above all. He cannot be described nor can he be explained by words. He is only to be realised by Yogabhyasa.

While concluding it is found necessary to interpret the word Venkata in the known right way for the benefit of those who would be in quest of it. Till now a correct interpretation is not given by any author. According to Venkatachala Mahatmya, Vem is said to be Amrita Bija and Kata to be Iswarya. No where in Sanskrit literature, do we find the meaning of Iswarya attributed to Kata. In another version Vem is said to be sin and Kata to burn it or destroy it. Similarly Vem does not possess the meaning sin, according to any authority in Sanskrit literature. These are Puranic allusions, which do not have or which do not convey a correct meaning, but add to the idea with which the particular Purana is written, as they are only idealistic. The author is of opinion, subject to criticism,
48
that the following interpretation of the word Venkata is correct.
Vem, the first letter, is a combination of the twenty-ninth consonant and the fourth vowel of the Sanskrit alphabet with a Bindu. Va is Amrita Bija according to Bija Nighantu. It is also a Bija that indicates Varuna, that counteracts poison and that eradicates death. The Bija Va represents Ap or water. Swadhishtana Chakra, which is the centre of Ap and Vam Bija, has Vishnu as its presiding deity. This Vishnu, depicted by the Bija Va is void of Prakriti. He is Purusha. E the fourth vowel is the Bija denoting Maya. Here Maya is Prakriti, in its latent and unmanifested form without a seperate existence. It is one with Vishnu, the supreme deity. Therefore VE is a blend of Vishnu and Maya or Purusha and Prakriti. To make the combination complete and perfect a Bindu is added to form VEM. The next letter is KA. KA represents Brahma. &ldquo;Ko Brahmani &ldquo;. The Bija Ka is said to be Vishama in Bija Nighantu. It is an odd. Brahma is an odd. Ekameva Adwithiyam Brahma &ldquo;. Ka is also a Kama Bija, indicating evolution and action, which are the qualities of Brahma. Therefore it is concluded that the letter KA indicates Brahma. The third letter TA is Uchchatana Bija. It is a sign of extermination, a quality of Siva. Hence TA denotes
66
49
is
Siva. The whole word VENKATA therefore depicts the triune nature of the One, which is the Parama Bindu of Sahasrara Chakra. Hypothetically. Parama Bindu is in triangular form. The apex represented by Brahma, and the two angles at the base are represented by Vishnu and Siva. These three put together is called Parama Bindu, which represents Jiva or god. Hence the word VENKATA denotes unity in trinity. This word represents the mastership or lordship of the three Bindus in one Parama Bindu, from which version we infer the meaning of the word Tripati. Tripati and Vemkata are synonyms, which signify the hill, but not the deity. The deity proper is called Vemkatesa or Tripatinadha, ie. the Lord of the hill, Venkata or Tripati.
This word
The Three Bindus of the Parama Bindu are taken to be three Gunas also. They are Sattwa, Rajas and Thamas. They are represented by the three component letters of the Pranava, ie. A. U. M. A stands for Brahma as it is an Atma Bija; U stands for Vishnu as it is a Bija of tone and also a Bija of Varuna or Jalada; and M stands for Siva as it is a Kalarudra Bija. These three Gunas are called Trivarga in a single word, which is also meant by a single letter SRI. The three Bindus of the one Parama Bindu are denoted by SRI and the hill which is signified by this Trivarga is called
50
Sri Saila. Trivarga is identical with Trimoorthis. The words Venkatesa, Tripathinadha and Srinivasa are synonyms. They carry the same meaning. Hence the Gayathri of Venkatesa Ashtakshari Mantra is read thus:
वेङ्कटेशाय विद्महे त्रिपतिनाथाय धीमहि तन्नः श्रीनिवासः प्रचोदयात् ॥
Mangalam Bhooyath.
