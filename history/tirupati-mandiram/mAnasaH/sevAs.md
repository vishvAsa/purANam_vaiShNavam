## sattumorai
Qualification - shikha and wear the traditional dress, and urdhvapundram.

just go near the temple main gate at 3-3:30 am and stand. others in similar garb will show up.  there is no ticket , and no advertisement or anything for this .

you will be able to stand near the lord for almost 25 minutes in this.

just go on a less busy day
