## Current rotation
Illustrious Gollapalli family - go back almost 50 generations in the service of the lord.

Gollapalli (bhAradvAja), paidipalli, peddinti, Tirupatamma , 4 families. All 4 families are tight. Right now over 80 people are there, male descendants of these 4 families. 

They do marry often only among themselves. It seems one of the gotras there got asoucham due to a death. so half the staff ineligible. So double duties for these remaining archakas.


### नामानि
All the archakas of tirumala have either venkata or srinivasa as part of their name.  If it’s missing from the name, then they add AV or AS as a prefix . AV - archakam Venkata.

## History
### Original setup
there are 4 families originally serving him.  

- each family has one incharge (or ) pradhana archaka 
- gollapalli, paidipalli, tirupatamma, and peddinti are the families. 
- 4 temples are under these families originally 
  1. main temple of venkatesa 
  2. varaha swamy temple 
  3. kondanda rama temple in Tirupati 
  4. Govindaraja swamy temple in Tirupati 

the families had an internal agreement where they would rotate between the temples on a 2 year cycle . 2 families for each temple from different gotras at all times.

the archakas became extremely rich .... this is because they used to get sambhavana . the rule was that 1/8 th of the day's proceeds would go to the archaka ( as per the system established by Ramanujacharya ). 

### Wealth & decadance
but in today's world, the proceeds of just the hundi, per day, are 4 crores on average. that means 50 lakhs in a single day . there are around 50 archakas in total from the families. but that still means each person would get 30 lakhs per month , for just being an archaka. 

this system of hereditary priesthood , meant every boy born in those families was joining the temple as an archaka. its called MIRASI SYSTEM 

over time, their proficiency and skill feel abysmally , so far that apart from 3-4 people, almost none of the others had much skill. This forced TTD to hire additional archakas through the regular route of exams and interviews  ( this is all in 70s and 80s )

### Employment
In 1984, NT Rama Rao government abolished the entire system of hereditary priesthood . the archakas petitioned, and they were given an option of being allowed to continue, and their sons also would be allowed to become priests ( the job vacancy from an archaka leaving or demise would be filled by a person from their own family). 

BUT, the 1/8th share system was removed, and fixed salaries on scales 1-9 were given instead. they became regular TTD employees, thus finally coming under the authority of TTD officers.

up until then, the archakas were sort of separate from the TTD secular administration system. but from this point onwards, they were legally bound to obey the adminstration

one thing you will notice is, there is no absolute right and wrong here. the history is very complicated , and mistakes and faults from all parties are there.
