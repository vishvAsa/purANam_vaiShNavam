so the scale of Tirumala is beyond any other temple. .... its a supertemple, and the true beating heart of Hinduism . not even ayodhya, kasi, srirangam, or any other teertha kshetra come even close to it in terms of scale of operations

## Education and research
currently TTD runs 
1. sri venkateswara university 
2. padmavathi mahila university 
3. venkateswara university of medical sciences - upto superspecialty level 
4. venkateswara Vedic university - the largest and oldest current Vedic university in the world
   venkateswara Vedic university , teaches all 4 vedas, in multiple shakas, and 4 agama schools also .  each student is given a fixed deposit of 4 lakhs currently, which they get upon their graduation . the education, lodging is completely free. currently 350 students are there. but 5-6 years ago, there were 1500 students. the previous Christian govt of AP reduced intake.
5. venkateswara zoological park and animal welfare center 
6. venkateswara horticultural institute 
7. venkateswara college of arts and sciences 
8. venkateswara institute of Shilpa shastra 
9. venkateswara music college 

and another 3 more institutes, all of which are funded by the temple.

## Temples
the funds from Tirumala are used to maintain over 2000 temples in Andhra Pradesh.  
TTD provides vigrahams, mike sets, and even appoints their archaka for free for a temple if petitioned.  i have experienced this myself, our own temple received free mulavirat from their Shilpa shastra institute and they even provided a stapathi for free.

## Food
tarigonda vengamamba annaprasadam complex serves 1 lakh free meals every single day ( Guinness book of world records ) . and the meals are really clean and nice.  even rich people prefer to eat there
