## Scale
the Tirumala temple has more pilgrims than mecca or Jerusalem... it is the most visited religious shrine on planet earth. yet it is not having the same kind of limelight as those. 34 million visitrors annually.

## sattumorai
Qualification - shikha and wear the traditional dress, and urdhvapundram.

just go near the temple main gate at 3-3:30 am and stand. others in similar garb will show up.  there is no ticket , and no advertisement or anything for this .

you will be able to stand near the lord for almost 25 minutes in this.  
you are also allowed to visit the other shrines in the temple ( normally these are off limits to the regular crowd)

just go on a less busy day

## पीठादिपति-श्लोकः
its called Atihyam of Venkateswara, recited whenever any mukhya peethadhipathi etc visits the temple.

it was published in english in saptagiri magazine by TTD. however, he said its actually 2 slokas, with  Shardulavikrita chandas, and Mandakranta chandas.
