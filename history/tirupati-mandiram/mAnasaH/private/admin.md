## Power corners
4 corners of power 

- TTD secular wing, the EO , and the temple specific incharge JEO 
- vaikhanasa archakas , the 4 families, and the sthanacharya ( a trained vaikhanasa scholar, not necessarily from the 4 families). 
  - the vaikahanasa archakas in Tirumala are allied with vadakalai, as they have strong connectiosn to ahobilam matham.
- ananthalwar/ Ananthanpillai and tatacharya system 
- the pedda and chinna jeeyars (tenkalai). 
  - the Tirumala matham doesn't have many followers. its main claim is the ability to get darshanam for its people, and thats what generates money for them.  and the annual donation from ttd
  - they have control over sattumorai seva . every day early morning this seva happens, where only sri vaishnavas are allowed. there is no que , no ticket. and direct entry into the temple without any wait time at all . also allowed to go very near the lord.

> the only 4 trustees of temples are Ananthanpillai family, Tatacharya family and the two jiyars

but of late, TTD has crushed the other 3 corners , and now almost unilaterally TTD EO. The problem is lack of unity . they all see each other as separate schools.

## TTD
TTD was set up by the british in 1933 , because even then the funds were being misappropriated by the mahants of hathiramji matham ( which is beside the temple on the hill ). TTD has basically created internal strife between archakas, fued between archakas and matham, and silenced the matham also


## shrI-vaiShNava maTha
the sri Vaishnava matham on Tirumala, was supposed to be the oversight and helper to these archakas.

TTD has a vice-like grip on the matham by 2 means

1. there is an annual sum of 2.5 crores given by TTD , to the peethadhipati, the pedda jeeyangar as a discretionary fund for whatever he wants.  they dangle this over his head every year and make him say or do aligning with them
2. there are numerous incidents , where the people from the matham have stolen money and gold from the temple. so TTD uses this to silence the matham
  - a person from the matham was stealing US dollars cash ... this happened the 3rd time just in 2025. you can even google it up
