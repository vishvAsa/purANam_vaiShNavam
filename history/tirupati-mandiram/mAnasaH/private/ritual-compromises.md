## rAmAnuja installation
originally, there was only a metal idol of Ramanuja, consecrated in his lifetime, by himself when he last visited Tirumala. the stone idol came almost 200 years later.

The vaikhanasa archakas objected to stone idol of him, as the metal was deemed sufficient. Tirumala is a eka bera archana temple, with some unique practices. 

But the sri vaishnavas moved an idol of Parthasarathy from that spot and instead put bhasyakara stone image there . 

so they placed his stone murthy at a height where the feet of his murthy are at the level of the chest of the lord's Dhruva murthy .  

Their reasons for this are from anathalwar's venkatachala itihasamala , where he says that the lord accepted ramanujacharya as his guru , because ramanujacharya did samashrayanam to the lord by giving him shanka chakra and urdhvapundra.

this was very strongly offensive to the vaikhanasa archakas. but by then they were already powerless, and the matham was dominant

## Alwars & vikhanasa
vaikhanasas have a separate guru Parampara, so they don't officially have the alwars in their line . sv s tried to install alwars in the temple, but the archakas refused.  
they said they would agree if there is a metal small icon, and provision to install vikhanasa maharshi vigraha in the temple.  
it was not accepted , so there is no vigraha of vikhanasa maharshi in the temple. One's installed separately 200 meters away near the varaha swamy temple.

## tIrtha-krama
in nithyarchana everyday, the first theertham and first satari must be given to the guru. for vaikhanasas , vikhanasa maharshi occupies this position, followed by the sthanacharya and then the other high level acharyas who are alive.

but in Tirumala, ramanujacharya receives this honor of first theertham and frist satari, followed by the pedda jeeyangar, and then the sthanacharya and pradhana archaka.

but the archakas, subtly in the garbhalayam, worship him arupa and drop water at guru sthanam and symbolically do nyasam for him.   

the jeeyangars cannot object , as they are not having vigraham.  the physical murthy is still ramanujacharya

## pAsurams
vaikhanasa nithyarchana is composed of 96 veda mantras ( exclusively veda mantras only ) there are no non-Vedic ( puranic, or agamic mantras in it ). so the entire worship is totally 100% using veda mantras . followed by nitya homa which completes it.

the jeeyangars slowly wanted to introduce pasurams into the worship sequence . so the core worship still remains with above mantras, but separately pasurams are introduced everyday.
