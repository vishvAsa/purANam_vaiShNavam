Maholsavam is in commemoration of the first Pratistha and it ends on the full moon day of the month Chaitra (March-April). Ratholsavam performed in the month of (November-December) is similar to Maholsavam in all respects except on the afternoon of the seventh day of festival, the Lord is taken round the temple in a special chariot known as Pushpaka Vimanam. The festival commences with the formal hoisting of the sacred Garuda ensign. The two processions that are held one each in morning and evening which involves taking the representative image of the Lord in procession, draws huge crowd. Palanquin pooja is conducted at noon and night when the fully decked up idol will be taken in procession. One of the Important item during the temple festival is Vishnu Yagam, which starts from first day night onwards and concludes with Poornahuthi on the 8th day of the temple festival. It is the only temple in Kerala where this Vishnu Yagam is held.On the 4th 5th and 8th days of the temple festival, the image is carried in a golden palanquin along the Southern, Northern and Western streets respectively. On the seventh day evening the image of the Lord will be taken around in a horse carriage with all the paraphernalia along the corridors of the temple for the palli vettai (the symbolic wild animal hunt) and meets the Siva of Udyansewara in the temple. On the 8th day, the deity is taken for bathing ( avabritha snanam) at the lake mandapam. Before this ceremony, there will be a procession of the community members who carry two country boats on their shoulders to the accompaniment of two caparisoned elephants, drum beats and nadaswaram, which start from the sasati area of Cherai to commemorate the fact that the forefathers had come to Cochin from the sasathi Pradesh of Goa to escape the forcible religious conversion of the Portuguese. The procession ends at the Papanasam Lake where the country boats are lowered. Soon after the Holy bath of the deity, there will be a sumptuous feast for all the devotees. After the bath, the idol of Venkateswara is seated on the throne at the Mantapam in the middle of the temple tank and after the performance of aarathi, the deity is taken on Golden palanquin in a procession oomprising of decorated elephants and panchavadya along the outer pathway of the Lake mandapam and enters the temple through the Eastern gopuram.
