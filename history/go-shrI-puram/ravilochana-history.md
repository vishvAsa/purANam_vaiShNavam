The murti and shaThAri are from achyuta raya temple of hampi. The temple claims that the murti was installed by saluva narasimha. It is wrong.  

The murti is from achyuta raya temple only, which is indeed near cakratirtha as well. 

The temple was not lost due to accidental fire but post talikota. Vijayindra tirtha found the murti after that in the well of achyuta raya temple.
