CHAPTER-III 
Sri Lakshmi Kumara Tatadesika 1572-1632 A-D. Sri Koti- kannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika (1572-1632 A.D.) was the son of Sri Tirumalirumcholai Aiyangar and the adopted son of Sri Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika. Born at Kumba- konam (Tirukkudandai) in the Tamil Year of Prajotpati (Kali 4673 1572 A.D.), Karthikai month, Anusham Star (Nakshatram) he was later taken to Kanchi, by his adopted father, for initiating him in the line of spiritual preceptorship (Acharya Sthanam). Elders have considered him as the incarn- ation of Viswaksena (Senainathan) the commander-in-chief of Lord Sriman Narayana. 
At the time of his birth, he remained still and did not cry. The parents thought that the child was still-born. Just then a noble lady appeared there, took the child in her lap and after suckling it with her milk, left the child on a piece of cloth torn from her saree. The child revived and began to cry. Some time after this incident when they went to worship Sri Komalavalli Tayar in the Temple, they observed to their great surprise the torn saree worn by her. Realisation dawned at once that the lady who brought life to their child was no other than Sri Komala- valli Tayar. Subsequently when the first birthday was celebrated at Kanchi to the child, Sri Perundevi Tayar also showered Her blessings on the child similarly when the child had an attack of high fever. Thus from his very birth he was endowed with the grace of Sri Tayar (Lakshmi Devi) which earned him the name of Lakshmikumara. 
Out of the sacred and precious heritage he inherited from his ancestors, Sri Tatadesika not only maintained the daily worship and management of the Temple, but also developed it further by his vast and huge constructions with big rampart walls, mantapas, prakaras, etc. Some of the works were started during the time of his father, as said earlier. One such monumental piece of his works is, the granite hundred 
24 
pillared mantapa containing skilful pieces of architecture like the stone chains on the corners and the cat and the pigeons all made of a single 'stone, with its monolithic pillars and exquisite cary- ings, which is even today the great attraction of tourists and foreigners at Kanchipuram. 
Sri Tatadesika was the Manager-general of the temple affairs (Sri Karya Durandara) from and during the time of the Vijayanagara King Venkatapatideva Maharaja, to whom he was the spiritual guru and officiated on the occasion of his 
coronation. 
It may be of interest to note here that the Kings of Vijaya- nagar were all invariably crowned by their spiritual preceptors, the Tatacharyas at the time of the coronation, just as we see in the days of Ramayana, Sage Vasishta, the royal guru of the Kings of "Surya Vamsa" performing the Pattabishekam cere- mony of the Kings including Sri Rama. To quote again, Dr. B. A. Saletore, "we may disgress a little in order to form an idea of the coronation scene at the courts of Vijayanagar. Rajanatha, in his well known work mentioned above, gives us an admirable picture of the coronation of Achyutaraya, when, so we are told, the Queen Varadhamba was also anointed to the House........... The most prominent person on such occasions was the Raja guru or Royal Priest. We are told that Venkata- pathideva Maharaya was anointed to the throne by Thathacharya, "the guru of his own gotra and other chief Brahmins" in a cop- per plate grant dated A.D. 1589 and again in A.D. 1602-3" 1. 
(From the copper plates examined during 1917-18 by the Ephigraphical Department of the Government of Madras, another piece of information that Sriranga was crowned by Tatacharya, is got. This Sriranga is evidently Sri Ranga III, who was crowned in or about 1642 A. D., and the Thathayarya mentioned here is evidently the son of the great Laxshmikumara Tatadeshika, either Sri Tirumalai Tatayarya or Venkata Tatayarya). 
Venkatapatideva Maharaja, "in his excess of admiration for his Acharya is said to have offered the whole Kingdom to

him" According to the Prapannamrtam Venkata entrusted the whole kingdom to Thathacharya and himself led a life of retire- ment. It was thus he happened to achieve his object of construction of temples all over India, spend huge amounts on establishing Agraharams, build tanks, provide capital for the maintenance of the temples, secure valuable jewels, gold coverings, etc. to the deities and give gifts towards marriage expenses to bachelors and unmarried girls in abundance. Since he was responsible for innumerable marriages, he acquired the title of "Koti Kannikadanam". In a sloka in praise of him, it is said humorously that even Hanuman and Vigneswara, the legendary bachelors, shuddered at this marital munificence, lest their bachelorism may also be affected one day. 
"கலயதி விபுதார்யே தாதயாசார்யவர்யே ஸபதி 
கடிததாராம் வர்ணின ஸ்வர்ணஜாலை: அவிரதமிஹகாஞ்ச்யாம் வீக்ஷ்ய கல்யாண கோடீம்- ஹநுமதி கணநாதே கம்பதே பிரம்ஹசர்யம்.” 
"He weighed himself against gold and silver and used all that wealth in the service of God Varadaraja of Kanchi in erecting the "Kalyanakoti Vimana" in gold for the Goddess Lakshmi in that famous temple... The Kalyana Koti Vimana was finished about 1614 A. D. and was evidently built in emula- tion of the Punyakoti Vimana set up by Krishnadevaraya. The latter was repaired by Tatacharya and regilded by him as it had decayed". 
He was a great Rama Bhaktha and so with the grace and help of Hanuman he was able to ward off the evils that surrounded him at times. "There is also a record registering the Hanumat Vimsati, a poem of twenty verses composed by him in honour of God Hanuman whose image he set up in the tank now known familiarly as the Aiyankarkulam dug by him. According to an inscription on the bund of the Tenneri Tank, Chingleput District, it seems to have been dug by Tatacharya". He is probably identical with the Tatacharya mentioned in a record dated 1590 A. D. as the grandson of Ettur Srinivasa Tatacharya and son of Srinivasa. This record registers the grant of a village called Vekatesapura in his favour. His 
26 
forebears have been connected with the spread of Vaishnavism and the family claimed descent from Srisailanatha, the uncle of the great reformer, Ramanuja 
Aiyangar" is a term generally used to denote a Vaishna- vite Brahmin. Since he was an outstanding figure of this community, he is exclusively termed as "Aiyangar". Just as we find streets, places, etc., nowadays being named after big leaders, certain streets, places and villages in and around Kanchi, were named after him and his consort, "Ammangar in those times. "Aiyanpettai", Aiyangarkulam ", "Aiyangarpalayam Street", Ammangar Street", etc. of Kanchipuram are some of the standing examples, even now.

In Aiyankarkulam, a village named after him as said above near Kanchipuram, he built a huge tank and temple to Sri Rama and His Bakta Sri Hanuman. It is said that as he was returning with huge riches to Kanchipuram from one of his wide tours, it grew dark and he was forced to camp at this place for the night for performing his daily evening chores. Just then he was surrounded by a band of robbers. Sri Aiyangar was inside the tent uttering Rama Nama. As Hanuman is an unfailing attendant wherever Rama Nama is uttered, he came to the spot and stood guard at the entrance of the tent. When the looters approahed the tent, Sri Hanuman gave vent to a "Humkara (wrathful exclamation) out of which there sprang a band of men greater in number than the 'looters. They surprised the looters by their sudden appearance, wrested the torches from their hands, beat and drove them away. All this took place in such a swift and sudden manner that Sri Tatadesika who was in his trance was not at all aware of the happenings outside. When he got up next morning, the newly sprung up men with the blessings of Rama Bhaktha paid their obeisance to the Acharya and detailed to him the happenings of the previous night. Thereafter these men placed themselves at the service of the Acharya, who took them into his fold as disciples." 
Sri Tatadesika also constructed a huge well nearby with a big cloistered verandah and mantapa underneath-which is now known as "Nadapavi." A grand festival to Sri Devaraja27 
is performed annually on Chitra Pournami day in the temple at Aiyankarkulam and the Nadapavi (well). The festival, popularly known as "Aiyankarkulam festival" or "Nadabavi festival " attracts devotees in their thousands. 
Though he was a staunch Vaishnavite leader, he was tolerant towards other religions. It is said he was responsible for renovating a portion of the Siva temple at Tirukali- kunram, when approached by some Saivaites. 
The gold gilding of the Ananda Nilaya Vimana of 'Panipathigiri' was done in 1630 A. D. by him during the time of Venkata II". 
He was also responsible for establishing 500 Agraharas; performing 99 yagas and making 32 Tulabaras and the cons truction of Tenneri 
Tenneri lake, otherwise known also as Tata Samudram, near Kanchipuram. He had also installed idols of Sri Vedanta Desika in so many "Divyadesas " like Thirukkanna Mangai, etc. He had also composed several 
"Grantas" 
His various life episodes and sevices are inscribed on stone walls all round the Temple of the Lord of Hastigiri and other important Temples of the south. He is also deified along with his consort, Sri Ammangar, in Sri Vedanta Desika's shrine, in our Temple, Kumbakonam, Srirangam and other places. 
Sri Devaraja and Sri Perundevi are brought in a grand procession to his shrine and a very big festival takes place for a full day in his honour on his annual "Tirunakshatram" day of Kartikai Anusham. In all the perambulations of Lord Varadaraja and Sri Perundevi, Sri Vedanta Desika and Sri Tatadesika and his consort are bestowed with special "Satari" etc. honours, which is an unfailing feature in the Temple. His life is a true example of how a Vaishnavite grahastha should spend and live for others, immersed deeply in devotion and service to the Lord Almighty. 
Sri Tatadesika was the author of many works like, "Lakshmi 
Niyudam", Panchagranthi Nipaharam " 
66 
66 
28 
"Sapthagranthi Nipaharanam", "Desika Prabanda Yeedu " Nigama Parimala Arumpadam", etc. He has also brought out a philosophical work by name, "Satvikabrahama Vidya Vilasa". Based propably on this work, the Kannada Poet Rangaraja, who lived at the court of Chikka Deva Raja, brought out a work of the same in Kannada. Another work called "Panduranga Mahatmya" was also made by this great Acharya. This is also to be distinguished from the Telugu work of the same name by Tenali Ramakrishna. A work called, Hanumat Vimsati, composed by him in praise of Hanuman is inscribed on the walls of the temple built by him at Aiyankarkulam, evidently after he was saved by Him from the bandits. "He is called in the Dalavai Agraharam grant, as "The ornament of the wise". Dr. N. Jagadesan, Ph.D., describes him as a distinguished man of letters and is known for the authorship of a play in five Acts "Parijatha Apaharana "10. 
In Kali 4733 Prajotpatti (1632 A. D.) Tamil Panguni month (on the day after Sri Rama Navami) This great Acharya attained moksha, on the way to Chandragiri from Tirumala Hills. Thus ended, with him, a golden era in the renaissance and prosperity of our Temple.

8. The gold-gilding of the Ananda Nilaya Vimanam by Sri Tatadesika was effected presumably during the time of Venkata II in 1630 A. D. In this connection, historians like Sri C. S. Srinivasachariar and Sri P. V. Jagadeesa Iyer have given the dates as Saka 1492 equivalent to 1570 A. D. Which is exactly the one previous cyclic year of Pramoduta. But actually this had taken place during the next Pramoduta only i. e., 1630 A. D. This anachronism has got to be pointed out since Sri Tata- desika's time was between 1572 and 1632 A. D.-354 of 1919 & T. T. etc. Devasthanam Epi. Series-Report on the inscriptions.
