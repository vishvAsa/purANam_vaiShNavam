CHAPTER-II 
< 
Before proceeding further, it may be relevant here to give an account of the history of the Tatacharyas as royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs. The Vijayanagar Kings from Vira-Sayana Udayar down to Venkata III (the middle of the 17th century), who, notwithstanding their general religious toleration seem to have in later times developed a leaning towards Vaishnavism, and to have made the Varadaraja Temple an object of their special adoration'. This is evidently due to the influence their preceptors, the Tatacharyas of Kanchipuram had over them. Ettur Singaracharaya and his brother Ranga- charaya enjoyed royal patronage under Virupaksha. From this, it does not mean that they had lost touch with Kanchi, Temple of Varadaraja, and their kinsmen there. Their interest in this Temple must have been ever-abiding and they should have lost no opportunity to impress upon their patrons of Vijayanagar the need to develop the leanings of the latter in Vaishnavism to take concrete shape in utilising their resources in building the structures and maintaining the worship in the Temple. 
In Saka 1387 (1465 A.D.), according to an inscription" during the reign of the Vijayanagar King, Virapratapa Devaraya Maharaja of the Sangama dynasty, one Kumara Tata Aiyangar of Satamarshana gotra, is said to have contributed 400 panams for offerings to Perarulalapperumal, "who was pleased to take his stand at Tiruvattiyur". Devaraya II was the greatest ruler of the Sangama dynasty. He is distin- guished in Inscriptions by the title of "GAJÄBETEKARA”, i.e., elephant hunter. He is sometimes called, "Immadi Deva- raya". It is significant that this "Immadi" prefix is also attached to the names of the Tatacharya-preceptors Vijayanagar rulers. 
of the 
King Virupaksha II 1465-85 (A.D.). King Virupaksha II was the next Vijayanagara King whose story may be related here. During his reign two Tatacharya brothers, 
13 
figure prominently by name Ettur Singaracharaya and Ranga- charaya of whom the former was the royal preceptor. They were very proficient in the exposition of the Ramayana. This is a heritage which they inherited from their ancestor Sri Periya Tirumalai Nambikal who was said to have attained to great glory by his mastery in Srimad Ramayana. Sri Ramanuja, his nephew had to make, it is said, eighteen trips to Tirupati to get himself initiated in this sacred treatise*, under him. 
There is also a story regarding the spiritual powers through which the Tatacharya brothers warded off the evil spirit that possessed the King's daughter". 
The genealogy of the members of the Tatacharya family is found given in an inscription". King Virupaksha according to an inscription made some offerings to our Temple'. This connection of the Tatacharyas with the Vijayanagar royal line continued till the last. 
The next prominent King of the 
the Tuluva Dynasty. his guru. 
Prof. K. A. 
Krishnadevaraya 1509-30 A.D. of the line, is Krishnadevaraya He had also a Tatacharya as Nilakanta Sastry describes the Sri Vaishnava leaders in the sixteenth century as "able leaders who were men of considerable learning. They were men of great tact and possessed much skill in carrying on religious propaganda. According to the Telugu literary tradition, a Sri Vaishnava teacher, called Tatacharya was the guru or spiritual advisor of Krishnadevaraya”. 
66 
This Tatacharya was Venkata Tatacharya the elder brother of Panchamata-banjanam Tatadesika. Dr. B. A. Saletore describes him in the following words: 
......the famous dictator, Venkata Tatarya whom as already narrated above, Krishna Devaraya, the great, invested with uncommon religious powers in A.D. 1523, was entitled to receive the first THIRTHA and PRASADHA in all the great Vishnu Temples in Vijayanagra Ghanadri and all the 77 durgas, gutti durga, etc. in all the cities to the east and west of Vijayanagara as far as the sea; in all the durgas to the north and south as far as Madura and all the holy places such as Kanchi, Trisaila and Khadri excepting Srirangam, Ahobila and Ghatikagiri, privileged to get 
14 
the first honours in the assemblies of the Sri Vaishnavas and authorised to make enquiries into the conduct of all castes owing allegiance to Ramanuja and to punish the delinquents in regard to religious and social matters". 
Krishnadevaraya was an ardent Vaishnavite as evidenced by his munificence to our Temple in gilding the Punyakoti Vimana with gold and rendering several other acts of benevolence1o. In this he was chiefly guided and influenced by his Tatacharaya- preceptor who was naturally interested in the Temple as its cus- todian. "There appears to have fiourished two or three people bearing the name of Tatacharya during the first half of the 16th century." 
A copy of copper plate grant mentions "Venkata Tatarya (of Sathamarshna gotra - Apasthamba Sutra - Yajus Sakha, son of Ahobilacharya son of Srirangadesika) on whom Krishnaraya conferred some privileges in 1522 A.D.". This Tatacharya was the elder brother of Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika as said above. But the father's name is wrongly quoted and the grand father is Sundara Desika and not Sriranga Desika. 
Though an ardent Vaishnavite devotee, Krishnaraya gave due regard and respect to religious heads like Vyasa Tirta of the Madwa Math. He was also impartial in his munificence towards both Siva and Vishnu Temples, as evidenced by his present- ation of a car each to the Vinayaka and Krishna images of the two temples at Kanchi 1*. This is further borne out by the following extract:- ". 
18 
The Manucarita gives a brief but poetic description of the Sabha or the royal assembly as it existed during the time of Krishnaraya. To this assembly called Bhuvanavijaya, flocked the Amaranayakas and their repre- sentatives, Chiefs of subordinate states, Princes, Dalavays, Mer- chants, Ambassadors from foreign states, Pandits, Poets, Philosophers, Theologians and all those that depended upon the court for eking out a living. The 'Amuktamalyada' alludes to the Sabha which was attended by the Ambassadors from foreign Kingdoms. It was here that the Emperor gave audience to representatives of foreign rulers and heard the disputations of 
1 
15 
rival Theologians and Pandits. It was here Vallabha, Chaitanya, Vyasathirtha and Tatacharya waxed eloquent over the excellence of their respective creeds........... 
Panchamata Banjanam Tatadesika 1509-1591 A.D: One of the luminaries of the renowned Vaishnavite Acharyas in the line of Sriman Natamunikal was Sri Panchamatabanjanam Tatade- sika, son of Kandanur Srinivasachariya who flourished at Kanchi in the sixteenth century, A.D. Born in the Tamil Year Vibava, Masi month and Swati star, corresponding to Kali 4610, he was named "Tatadesika" by his parents, after Sri Peria Tirumalai Nambikal, their illustrious ancestor and uncle of Sri Bashyakar, whose birth star also happens to be "Swathi". He had his education in the Vedas and the Sastras under his father and subsequently he was initiated in the Sri Bashya and other philosophical works, by his maternal uncle, Shashta Parankusa Swami, the sixth pontiff of the Ahobila Math. He attended to the 'Srikaryam' service also under the behests of his uncle, it is said. 
He was a great scholar and a spiritual preceptor to the Vijayanagara rulers, Sadasiva, Ramaraya, Tirumala, Sri Ranga and Venkata. Sri Doddayachar otherwise known as Mahacharya another Vaishnavite scholar and devotee was his contemporary as also the famous Saivite scholar Appayya Dikshita. This Mahacharaya, finding the enormous influence Sri Tatacharya wielded over the Vijayanagar rulers sought his help to restore and establish the worship of Sri Govindaraja at Chidambaram, when there was some trouble over it caused by the Saivites. Sri Tata- charya accordingly, helped in fulfilling the same 1. The works "Panchamathabhanjam" and "Chandamarutham” 1A were produced by Sri Tatacharya and Sri Doddayacharya respectively as a counter to the Advaitic philosophy expounded in those days by Saivite scholars like Appayya Dikshitar. Regarding Sri Panchamatabanjam Tatacharya, Dr. B. A. Saletore says, 
66 
an equally great name among the Rajagurus was that of the celebrated Tatacharya, the family guru of Ramaraya, Born in the Srisaila Vamsa of the famous Srisailanatha, also known as Peria Tirumalainambi, the maternal uncle of Ramanuja, 
16 
Tatacharya, the son of Srinivasa Guru, learned in all Sastras, was the Acharya of Rama Raja. He accompanied the Emperor to Chandragiri” 1⁄4". 
Rama Raya (C. 1550) is said to have preferred Tatacharya to Govinda Desika as his Acharya. A manuscript work of the seventeenth century attributes to Rama Raya anti-brahmanical tendencies. This "estimate of Rama Raya seems to be exagger- ated for neither contemporary inscriptions nor the literature and chronicles of the period say anything about his anti-brahmanical tendencies. Further the author of the work appears to have been a Madwa disappointed in his expectations at the fact Govinda Desika was replaced by Tatacharya in the exalted position of being the guru of the King. Obviously the author of the work was a partisan and wanted to paint Ramaraya in black colours, on account of his preference to Tatacharya" 1o. 
Ramaraya was completely under the influence of Sri Tata- charya, the Rajaguru. During his times and during the times of the inheritors of the fragment of the empire after the battle of Talikota, mass conversions took place engineered by the Rajaguru under State patronage. Sri Appayya Dikshita in his 66 NIGRAHASHTAKAM " says that the leader of the Vaishnavas had taken a resolute vow to stamp out Saivism from the land. The Prapannamrtam, a work of one Ananta- charya, which purports to record the history of Vaishnavism and the lives of the Acharyas, refers to Sri Appayya Dikshita as living at Chidambaram, resplendent with fame and unassailable by controversialists, sectarian or philosophical and proceeds to state that to refute his great works on Sivadvaita and Advaita, Sri Tatacharya wrote a work called "Panchamata- banjanam" and Mahacharya wrote a work called "Chanda- marutam and thus both of them defended the creed of Sri Ramanuja". The lives of Sri Tatacharya and Appayya Dikshita "ran together during the major part of the sixteenth century. During all these years of Sri Tatacharya's supremacy, Sri Appayya Dikshita is not known to have anything to do with the Vijayanagar court. After 1585 when Venkatapathi was re-establishing the glory of Vijayanagar and the younger Tatacharya was the Rajaguru, Sri Dikshita was invited to the court and was held in great honour "1" 
17 
With his immense power and wealth, he secured from the kings, Sri Tatacharya started many constructional works in our Temple many of which were later completed by his illustrious son, Sri Lakshmi Kumara Tatadesika. During the period of Sadasivaraya he brought one Ramanujayya from Tiruppullani for undertaking these works, whose services are praised in two Tamil verses.1 He is said to have attained to great fame and beautitude". Later, his family settled down at Kanchi itself as there was opportunity for continued work. It is said that "the right of supervising the repairs and certain items of service which was then in the hands of one Ramayya was cancelled, perhaps at the instance of Kumara Tatacharya by Venkatapatideva Maharaya, and conferred on this Parankusa Thiruppanippillai1. He is described as a probable partisan of the all-powerful Tatacharya. The right of supervising repairs (Tiruppani Nirvaha Kaniya kshi) was sold by Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatachari and other trustees of the same temple to Tiruppani Sri Parankusan and his disciples "21. This is attested by Inscriptions at Tiruppukkuli Vijayaraghava- Perumal Temple during the time of Srirangadeva Maharayaa2. We learn that Sri Tatacharya was the Guru of Venkata even when he was a Viceroy in 1582 A.d** and that Sri Tatacharya was managing the temple affairs**. 
Thus we find the major constructions and improvements that took place during the sixteenth century viz., the gopuras, prakaras, mantapas, like Abhisheka mantapa, Hundred pillard Mantapa containing beautiful pieces of architecture, Vimanas, etc. were all started, managed and completed by the Tata- charyas who had the full support, backing and patronage of the Vijayanagar Kings from Krisnadevaraya down to Venkatapati Deva Maharaya (Venkata I) and Venkata II. 
From the inscriptions of the Yatoktakari Temple, we are informed that in all the inscriptions of the King, Ettur Kumara Tatacharya figures prominently'. 
Every member of this family styled himself as Tatacharya of Ettur and hence arises the confusion in clearly identifying persons bearing this name. This is certainly true, in that it 
2 
18 
requires, some clarification, So let us be excused for a small digression here. Because of the same names and appellations attached to the members of this family, even historians and epigraphists had to give conflicting opinions. For instance, while giving the genealogy of the Tatacharya family of Kanchi, S. I. T. I. III states that "Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya 1509-91 A. D. (otherwise known as Kotikanyaka- danam Tatacharya whose name was Lakshmi Kumara) is the same as Lakshimikumara Tatacharya""" This is not correct. Lakshmi Kumara Tatacharya was the son of Panchamata- banjanam Tatadesika by adoption. Sri Lakshmi Kumara's natural father and younger brother of Panchamatabanjana, was Tirumalirumcholai Aiyangar of Kumbakonam2". 
One thing should be clearly borne in mind. Sri Lakshmi- kumara Tatacharya was born at Kumbakonam in 1572 A. D., and lived upto 1632 A. D. Records or inscriptions mentioning the name Kumara Tatacharya prior to 1572 A. D., therefore, should be that of his father Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya or his ancestors. The titles Lakshmi Kumara and Kotikannika- danam belong to Sri Tatacharya who flourished between 1572-1632 A. D. He officiated at the Pattabisheka ceremony of Veera Venkatapati Deva Maharaya at a very young age of fourteen or fifteen when his father was alive and very old. Evidently because of his old age (nearing eighty) he had the coronation done through his young adopted son "Aparyapta- mrta" who later became the illustrious Lakshmi Kumara Kotikannikadanam Tatadesika. 
Venkatapatidevamaharaya (1585-1614 A.D.) Now, we come to Vira Venkatapatidevamaharaya (Venkata I), the fourth son of Hiri Timmaraja (Tirumala) who ruled for 29 years, after having been crowned by his royal guru, Sri Lakshmikumara Tata- desika in 1585 A.D. His reign witnessed vast improvements in the construction of temples as well as the expansion of his empire to its original greatness after the battle of Talikota. Though the whole empire devolved upon him after the death of his brothers Sri Ranga and Rama Raja, Venkata chose to remain at Chandragiri, his original seat of Kingdom. This was perhaps in deference to the wishes of his preceptor, Sri Tatacharya, who19 
desired that he should remain near the sacred Tirupati. Because of this, he is sometimes called as the "Raja of Chandra- giri" and his Acharya as Venkataraya Tatacharya, the Tatacharya whom King Venkata revered. A good number of inscriptions mentioning Sri Tatadesika during the reign of this monarch have been found on the walls of "Arulala Perumal" Temple at Kanchi and in several other places of the Empire. 
29 
Venkata is said to have been a subordinate of Sadasivaraya in Saka 1489 (1567 A.d.) 2*, He was referred by his title alone, viz., "Viravasantaraya" in two epigraphs from the Salem and North Arcot Districts". During the reign of his father Tirumala and his elder brother Sriranga II he governed the Chandragiri Rajya as its Viceroy as indicated in the Telugu Kavya "Vasu- caritamu" 1 and next held "Charge of the Udayagiri, Kondavidu and other outlying hill fortresses". He had married five queens, one of whom Krishnamamba or Krishnajiamma ** is mentioned in the T.D.E. Report. 
On his accession to the Karnataka throne after his brothers, he transferred the capital of Vijayanagara from Penugonda to Chandragiri as aforesaid. "Having been initiated by his GURU Kumara Tatacharya, he became an ardent Vaishnava and encouraged the propagation or Vaishnavism. He was a staunch devotee of Sri Venkateswara. As a memorial of his Bhakthi, a copper statue of his, with folded hands and palms joined in a prayerful aspect is found placed on the south side within the inner front Mantapa adjoining the entrance PADIKAVALI GOPURAM of the temple of Sri Venkateswara at Tirumala with the name "Venkatapathirayulu" incised in Telugu characters on the right shoulder. The figure appears to be muscular in form and ordinary stature, but the warrior in the King is not prom- inent as in the statue of Krishnaraya placed in a group with his two queens on the north side of the same Mantapam ""." 
"Although himself a staunch Vaishnava, yet Venkatapati- devamaharaya welcomed the Jesuit fathers to his Court at Chandragiri in 1598 and granted them complete freedom to preach their religion and erect churches 
churches throughout his dominions. He held disputations on God, Philosophy, and 
20 
Mathematics with the teachers or Philosophers almost everyday. The protagonist of Vaishnavism, Saivism and Christianity vied with one another to convince him of the superiority of their respective creeds and he gave them all a patient hearing. Himself a great scholar, he was devoted to the protection of the learned. Eminent philosophers like Tatacharya and poets like Chenna- maraju, Matla Ananta and Tarigoppula Mallanna adorned his Court. With a view to foster learning he and the Nayaka of Madura endowed several colleges for the maintenance of pro- fessors and students who were supplied with victuals, cloths and everything they needed......................... .....His copper statue in the Tirupathi Temple is another proof of his artistic taste". Though he is styled here as Venkata II, he is Venkata I according to us and many other authorities we have quoted elsewhere. 
• 
It is thus seen that in the spread of Sri Vaishnavism in Vijayanagar from the days of Mallikarjuna the members of the Srisailapurna family played an important role. This should lead to the conclusion that although Mallikarjuna (1447-1465) and Virupaksha II (1465-1485) became convinced of Tatacharyas' greatness as spiritual leaders they did not openly change their faith in favour of Vaishnavism. But that they had special and exclusive leanings towards Vaishnavism cannot be questioned. Saluva Narasimha (1468-1491) ** Vira Narasingha (1505-1509) 86 Krishnadevaraya (1509-1529) Achyutaraya (1529-1542) Sada- sivaraya (1542-1570) ** and Sri Ranga I (1572-1585) ** were Vaishnavas of course not of the bigoted kind. An inscription of Devaraya dated 1465 records a grant of money to Kumara Tatayyangar, son of Tiruvenkadayyangar and grandson of Sottai Tozhappayyangar of Sathamarshana gotram, evidently belonging to the family of Srisailapurna,. The money was given for specific Naivedya in Arulalaperumal Temple. This is a clear proof for recognising the role of the members of Srisailapurna family played in our Temple and the honoured position they held in the court of the rulers of Vijayanagar.
