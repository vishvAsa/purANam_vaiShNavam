CHAPTER-IV

After the decline of the Vijayanagar Empire in the middle. of the 17th Century A.D. the Tatacharyas continued to main- tain the upkeep of the Temple, as usual, in its usual glory and splendour. The Temple was already well provided for by the munificence of the Vijayanagar monarchs, through the agency of Tatacharyas, who procured vast lands, properties and finance sufficient to last for generations. 

Subsequently they (the Tatacharyas) were sought after by the Wodeyar kings of Mysore. One of the descendants, Sri Venkata Varada Tatarya, the second son of Lakshmikumara Tatadesika went there as the royal guru of the Mysore Maharaja in the latter half of the 17th century.1 This Tatacharya's influence over the Mysore Wodeyars contributed not a little towards the uplift of the Temple. It is said orginally the Garudotsavam of our Temple was celebrated by the Kings of Mysore, through the instrumentality of their preceptor the Tatacharya and it was stopped only during the middle of the 19th century after nearly a century, on account of a small misunderstanding. We shall speak about this misunderstanding by and by.

In 1842 when the Government wanted to hand over back the administration of the Temple to the original mirasudars' of the trusteeship they called for applications from the claimants of all the temples. In our Temple there were four claimants to the trusteeship including the Tatachar. Mr. Freeze - the Collector who scrutinized the applications recommended that a committee consisting of all the four applicants might be entrusted with the administration. To this, Shri R.Kumara Tatacharya the applicant, was averse. He therefore declined the offer and went to Mysore where he was continuing as the royal priest. 

In his letter, declining the offer, to the Government Sri Kumara Tatacharya had stated that he could not in fairness be expected to run the administration of the Temple smoothly along with the office-holders, who were after all the servants of the Temple, on an equal footing. 

Subsequently the Revenue Board cancelled 31 the Collector's recommendation and ordered the entrusting of the Temple with Sri Kumara Tatacharya as the sole hereditary trustee. Upon this the Tashildar sent a letter to Sri Kumara Tatacharya who was at Mysore, then, requesting him to return and take over the trusteeship of the Temple as the sole custodian according to the orders of the Board of Revenue. Sri Kumara accordingly returned and took charge of the institution. This is given to show even in the forties of the last century the Tatacharyas were continuing as the royal preceptors in the court of Mysore and from this position of influence they continued to improve the Temple in many respects.

Subsequent to Sri Kumara Tatacharya who lived only for a short time, the trusteeship devolved on his son Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya. He was also continuing to visit the Mysore palace in his capacity as the royal guru. He procured some valuable gifts to the Temple from the Maharaja of Mysore out of which he recoated the Hamsa and Simha Vahanas and got the sanction of the Raja to gild the Tayar Vimana. He also prepared the copper plates covering of the Vimana for gilding them with gold but before it could fructify he passed away. With him, the connection between the Tatacharyas and Mysore Maharajas also ended.


This is the story told by elders regarding the disconnection. The Mysore Maharaja used to be an unfailing worshipper to the grand Garudotsavam which he himself was performing as told above and he was very particular about the Gopura dharsana on that day in the early hours of the morning. 

On a particular year he was late by a few minutes and the God had by then moved forward from the Gopuravasal a few feet. Just then the Maharaja arrived. He requested the Trustee (evidently Sri Krishnaswamy Tatachariar the brother of Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya) to take the vehicle back to the Gopuravasal, in order to have the Gopuravasal darsan. The trustee could not oblige him, since it was not desirable to move the God back. Disappointed and chaffed at this, the King went back. This is said to be the misunderstanding mentioned above. 

Subsequently, [[32]] one Gangabai Ammul, a philanthropic minded north Indian lady offered to do the festival. Her successors are continuing the festival even today under a trust, created by her.
