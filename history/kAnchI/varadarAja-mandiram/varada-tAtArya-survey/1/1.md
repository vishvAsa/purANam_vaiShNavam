CHAPTER-I 
Sriman Narayana, the Lord Supreme1, Who is all-pervading, all-powerful and all-merciful manifests Himself in five different forms2. They are Paratwa, Vyuha, Vibava, Archa and Antaryamin. He is the Ultimate Reality ever associated with SRI MAHALAKSHMI. 
PARATWA is Sri Vaikunta where the Lord is present as Para Vasudeva with His inseperable Consort Sri Mahalakshmi and 'Nitya-Suris' like Ananta, Garuda and Viswaksena. This is also called Paramapada and this state is said to be His 'Nitya-Vibuti'. 
VYUHA or manifestation is of four forms in which the transcendent (Para) God presents Himself for the well-being of humanity. The four forms are called Vasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Anirudda. 
VIBAVA is the Lord's Avataras or divine descents in this world as Sri Narasimha, Sri Rama, Sri Krishna etc. 
ARCHA is His deification in our Temples like Srirangam, Tirupati and Kanchi as Sri Ranganata, Sri Srinivasa and Sri Varadaraja respectively. 
ANTARYAMIN is His presence in our hearts as the inner- 
controller. 
Our Barat (India) is considered to be the most sacred of all the places on the earth. The Lord in His abundant mercy comes down from His Nitya-Vibuti or Sri Vaikunta to this earth (His Leela-Vibuti) through various Avataras to emancipate mankind, to destroy the evil forces and protect the innocent devotees. For the same purpose He is also enshrined in our Temples permanently, in the finitised Archa form. The Archa-murtis are lauded and glorified abundantly by our Alwars and Acharyas since they are more easy of realisation even with our limited physical senses, in this mortal world itself.

Ayodya, Matura, Maya (Haridwar), Kasi, Kanchi, Avantika (Ujjain) and Dwaraka are the seven sacred salvation- yielding cities of the earth. Our great Acharya, Sri Vedanta Desika has said that among the seven cities, our Kanchi is the most important." 
Again, there are 108 Vaishnavite Divyadesas or sacred places sanctified by our Alwars through their melodious out- pourings of devotion. Even here, our elders have singled out three as more important. They are 
They are Koil (Srirangam), Tirumalai (Tirupati) and Perumal Koil (Kanchi). 
KANCHI appears under all the above categories. Maha- kavi Kalidasa has praised this city as "Nagarishu Kanchi". It is the famous seat of learning and propagation of our Vaishnavite cult and other faiths. Great Seers, Bards, Alwars and Acharyas like Budatalwar, Tirumangai Alwar, Tiruk- kachi Nambikal, Sri Ramanuja, Kuratalwar, Nadadur Alwan, Nadadur Ammal, Appullar, Sri Vedanta Desika, Nayana Varadachariar, Panchamata-Banjanam Tatadesika, Lakshmi- kumara Tatadesika, Mahacharya and many others lived or stayed here worshipping the presiding deity Lord Varadaraja, and propagating the Visishtadvaita philosophy. Side by side the Buddists, Jains and Saivites were also preaching their faiths from this sacred centre. Hiuen-T-Sang, the famous Chinese traveller who visited this capital city in the 7th century A. D., during the time of Narasimha Pallava, acclaims it as a place of scholars erudite in their fields of study and advanced in culture. The first Principal of the Nalanda University started by Emperor Harshavardana in the north, it is said, was one Dharmapala who had his education under a scholar at Kanchi. Kautilya (Chanakya) the author of Arta- sastra, Parimelazhagar the famous annotator of "Tirukkural” and many other great scholars belong to this great city of learning where there existed a University of renown in olden days. 
This premier city of Kanchi is one of the most ancient cities of our land, situated fortyfive miles south-west of Madras, the capital of Tamilnadu in South India. It is well-planned 
6 
with broad streets and properly ventilated houses, which has won the admiration of even foreign travellers. The very name "Kanchi" has been given to it because the Lord of Hastigiri blessed Brahma, the creator, by appearing before him in his Aswameda Yaga' here. The Temple is situated at the eastern- most end of Kanchi which is in the form of a bow (Danura- kara). The Lord stands facing the city, showering His blessings on it. The western part is higher in level and the eastern part, lower. River Vegavati flows on the southern periphery of the city. A lake near the Temple towards the north is called "Arulala Putteri" (now colloquially called Allaputteri) after the name of Lord Arulala. The Lord of Hastigiri' is called by several names as Tevapperumal (Tepperumal), Varadaraja (Varada), Arulalan (Perarulalan), Devarajan (Devadirajan), Hastigirinatan etc. The lands irrigated by this lake is called "Tiruvidipallam", just on the south of the lake and in between the Temple and the lake. The reason or origin of this name is said to be that the "Pallam" or depth was caused on account of the earth dug out from there for raising the level of "Tiruvidi" of the Lord, viz., the Sannidi street with the elevated houses on both sides. The steps leading to the houses serve as a gallery to the vast concourse of worshippers to have the Gopuravasal Darsan" of the Lord on the famous Garudotsavam day in the early hours of the morning. The street in front of any Temple is usually called Sannidi street. But it will be prefixed with the name of the Temple before which it runs. For instance, at Kanchi itself, there are Sannidi streets like Yatoktakari Sannidi street, Astabujam Sannidi street, 
Ekamreswarar Sannidi 
66 
street, Kamakshi Amman Sannidi street etc., to denote the name of the Temple for which the Sannidi street stands. But our Temple's Sannidi street is named merely as Sannidi street indicating its fame and prominence in the city. 
The street just north to the Sannidi street is called 'Vadakku Vasal street' (colloquially called Varakuvasal street), though this name with this significance has been now changed. Just like the Sannidi street, the Mada streets are also named without the mention of the Temple's name, as North, East and South Mada streets, whereas the other Mada streets of the city 
7 
are called with the names of the temples concerned. A street just towards the east of the North Mada street is called 'Tiruchola; street' denoting its situation on the side of our Lord's garden (Tottam or Tirucholai). 
A tank towards the north-east of the Temple is called 'Deva- rajan Kulam' after the name of our Lord. One street called Hastigiri street is on the southern side of the Temple. One among the several names of our Lord is 
is 'Girisan' or 'Malayalan' in Tamil. There is a street, towards the west of the Temple bearing this name Malayalan, called Malayala(n) street. 
The Easwaran Temple" on the south-western side of our Temple is called "Punyakotiswarar Temple", perhaps indicating its situation whence the Punyakoti Vimana' of our Lord is visible. Not only at Little Kanchipuram but also at Big Kanchipuram we can find such significant names of places and streets. Our Lord is Varada Raja. The four Raja streets are named after Him. The grand Brahmotsava is celebrated in all its flare and pomp, around here in the Tamil month of Vaikasi. The huge car of our Lord is also dragged round these four Raja streets. 
The Gangai Kondan' Mantapa built by the Chola King Rajendra I (Gangai Kondan) is situated at the north-western corner of the Raja street for our Lord's alighting here during the days of the Brahmotsava on the huge Vahanas both in the day and in the night. 
There are some interesting particulars regarding Krishna Devaraya's mediation in connection with some difficulty regarding the routes of the cars of Siva Temple and ours. It seems the trustees and other employees of both the Temples came to an agreement before him as regards the routes to be followed by the Cars and Vahanas of the two Temples during their festive rounds. 
"Attiyur " - "Tiruvehka" - " Ashtabujam "." Velukkai” "Tirutanka" (Toopul) - "Uragam" - "Padagam "- "Parame- swara Vinnagaram" etc. etc. are some of the fifteen sacred localities (Divyadesas) of the city.

The puranio version of this great city and Avatara of Lord. Hari as Varadaraja before Brahma, the creator, in his Aswameda Yaga (Sacrificial fire) is given in the "Hastigiri Mahatmya a part of the Brahmandapurana." This is depicted, as is usual with the puranas, in the form of a dialogue between sage Narada and Brugumaharshi. 
According to it under the behests of an "Asareeri " (a voice from an unseen body coming from the skies) Brahma performed the yaga at this place which is called "Satyavratha Kshetram in order to get his mind purified. It is said, that a good deed done here is equal to that of one thousand such good deedsR performed elsewhere. Brahma could cleanse his mind only by performing one thousand Aswameda yagas. Since he could not complete so many yagas in his lifetime, he was advised by the Asariri to go to this place for performing the yaga in order to achieve his object. 
Accordingly, when Brahma started the yaga at this place, his consort Saraswati tried to prevent it by assuming the form of a rivulet (Vegavati) and rushing towards the site of the yaga with the object of destroying it. She had a grouse against her husband previously. When she was requested to forget it and come to participate in the yaga as the Darmapatni to the 'Karta' (the performer), she refused, incited by the Asuras'. 
Brahma, the Rishis and the Devatas prayed to the Lord for protecting them from the calamitous consequences of the deluge. Bhagavan Sri Narayana, in response to their prayers laid Himself bare before the on-coming fury. of the flood. Vegavati' had to subside and turn in a different direction before the Lord who proved to be a dam. This is the Tiru Vehka' the Sacred place where the Lord lies and the Deity is called Yatoktakarin. In Tamil He is called "Sonnavannam- 
6 
Saitha-perumal." 
After that Brahma successfully completed the yaga, along with his pacified Darmapatni Sri Saraswati, in which the Lord appeared before him in the Punyakotivimana in all His9 
glory and resplendence as Varada (giver of boons). After worshipping the Lord, Brahma returned to Satyaloka, mentally purified. Before he left, he prayed that the Lord may deign to remain in the place everlastingly to bless mankind. Acceding to his request the Lord remains here making this place His abode on the earth (Vaiyamaligai). From that time onwards the place has come to be known as Kanchi' since Ka' (Brahma) worshipped Hari' from here. 
" 
Great seers, Alwars and Acharyas have sung in praise of Sri Varadaraja in ecstatic terms. Sri Vedanta Desika had sworn, that he would prefer stay in this mundane world, worshipping the Lord of Hastigiri to the attainment of Vaikuntavasa (Moksha). Such is the enchanting and soul- stirring beauty and gracefulness of the Lord that our great devotee-saints were completly dazed and captivated when worshipping Him. 
Sriman Narayana also sends His close attendants and devotees the Nityasuris and Sudarsana Panchajanya (discus and conch) etc. to this world whenever he finds it necessary to retrieve mankind. One such devotee was the Sage Satamarshana who was the descendant of Vishnuvardana, one who was deeply immersed in the devotion of Lord Vishnu, as the name itself signifies. 
It is said that Satamarshana came to the world later as Satakopa. Sriman Natamunikal who descended from Satamar- shana worshipped Sri Satakopa who was the manifestation of his great ancestor himself for restoring the Tamil Vedas. 
Later his grandson Sri Alavandar, Sri Tirumalai Nambikal Sri Ramanuja and Sri Pillan spread the Visishtadvaita philosophy handed down to them by Sriman Natamuikal. Side by side with the Sri Bashya pravachanas (interpetation and teaching of Brahma Sutras) these Vaishnavite savants ingratiated the prabandas of Alwars as an inseparable part with their cult. The principle of Ubaya Vedanta thus became the main feature of Vaishnavism. Tirumalai Nambi is stated to have been an authority on both these Vedantas.10 
10 
Sri Peria Tirumalai Nambikal, the grandson and disciple of Sri Alavandar and maternal uncle of the great Vaishnavite teacher Ramanuja was staying at Tirupati (Tirumalai) and doing Kainkaryam to the Lord of the Seven Hills side by side with his teachings of Vaishnavism. He was also one of the Acharyas of Sri Ramanuja, his nephew. It is said that Lord Srinivasa was very much pleased with him for the paternal care he was taking of Him and on one occasion the God is said to have addressed him "mama-tata " (my father) and ever since then Peria Tirumalai Nambikal came to be recognised by the name Tatacharya, a title which his descendants also began to assume. "There were several branches of the family, many members of which were holding important positions during the period of the Vijayanagara rule ".11 
Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan (11th century, AD) was the son of Sri Tirumalai Nambikal. Sri Ramanuja was the sister's son of Sri Nambikal (Srisailapurna). Sri Pillan's keen perception, deep knowledge in the scriptures and devotion to Sri Ramanuja endeared him very much to the latter. He was chosen by Sri Ramanuja as the fit and competent person to translate the Tiruvaimozhi, since he had both the capacity and heredity to undertake the task, as a descendant of Sriman Natamunikal.1 The annotation of Tiruvaimozhi thus brought out by Sri Pillan under the behests of his Acharya is called the famous Aaraayirappadi' the first gloss in Manipravala, an elegant mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil expressions of the Divya Prabandas. Further he was made the first and foremost among the seventy-four Simhasanatipatis created by Sri Rama- nuja for propagating the Visishtadvaita philosophy after him,'' and was also announced by him during his last days that he (Pillan) was his Gjnana Putra and successor. 14 
Srinivasacharya1 
After Pillan, Tirumalai 
may be mentioned in this great line (Vamsa). He was one of the most trusted disciples of Sri Vedanta Desika (13th and 14th Centuries AD). Tradition has it, that Sri Vedanta Desika. who was attending to the worship of Lord Varadaraja, later 
11 
entrusted the responsibility to Sri Srinivasacharya, whom be considered as the best choice for this service. Thus the Srikaryam of the Temple devolved upon him and, later on on his descendants.

5. The names Raja Street, East Raja Street, etc. in Big Kanchipuram given to the four streets through which the procession of our Deity passes during the grand Brahmotsava may perhaps suggest that they are given to these streets because the Raja (Varadaraja) passes through them. There is no undeniable proof for assuming this, since the ancient rulers at Kanchi used them for their own purposes like royal processions This suggestion therefore merits consideration.
