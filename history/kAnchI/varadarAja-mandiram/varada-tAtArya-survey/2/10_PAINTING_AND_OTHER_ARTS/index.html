  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-X PAINTING AND OTHER ARTS Under “General Features” In Section I, “Places where paintings are found” the author calls the sect-marks on the paint- ings on the walls surrounding the central shrine as ’traces of vandalism’. The paintings which are very much decayed and cannot boast of the Ajanta or Ellora type, are not very clear and in most cases completely disfigured due to long age. The author himself concedes this on page 177 where he says most of the colour has vanished or become dull and what remains can only be seen in patches. Vadakalai sect-marks appear on the top of the walls, where the aforesaid paintings exist in a withered state, but they do not in anyway cause damage or disfigurement to the already decayed paintings. This causes a great eyesore to our author naturally because these sect-marks are all Vada- kalai. Such ‘vandalism’, if vandalism they could be called is in’ abundance in Temples like Srirangam, Tiruvallikkeni and so many other Temples of the south where the Tenkalai features are displayed prominently. But they will not create any such impression in the author’s mind since these sect-marks belong to his own sect. This is one more instance of the staunch sectarianism exhibited by the author in this book. The interesting point of this remark is that he carefully avoids mentioning them as Vadakalai marks. He simply says ‘caste marks’ so that he may not commit himself to testify to the existence of Vadakalai sect marks. This is a general policy usually adopted by the members of his sect, not to commit themselves to accept or recognise the existence of Vadakalai marks in the Temple. The use of the the word caste before the word marks is erroneous. Whether the mark is of the Vadakalai or Tenkalai kind, the mark has nothing to do with caste as it is not worn by the members of a particular caste alone. The urdvapunram as it is worn by the Sri Vaishna- vas belonging to Ramanuja school must be called only creed mark and those of the Vadakalai or Tenkalai shall be called as sectarian marks. 117 Section: 2-Wood Carvings’ (Page 178): It is a welcome silver lining in the clouds to see here the author’s saying that “in the beginning of the 17th century Ettur Kumara Tatacharya is said to have presented a number of vahanas though the names are not specified”. But it is strange how the author says that the names of the vahanas are not specified when he refers to the particular inscription which, mentions this. This inscription ’ specifically details the list of vahanas made by Sri Tatacharya and various other items. They are the Elephant, Horse, Serpent, Garuda, Anjaneya, Sun, Moon, Palanquin, made of pearls and gems, Hamsa &amp; Simha (Lion) all,made of gold and silver. “Vahan-rupyai-Swarnai etc”. is the sloka. In the same inscription we get the information of the offering of the gem-set Kiritams, Kavachas and other costly jewels by Sri Tatacharya2. This evidently refers to the “Tho- ppaharam’ a head-wear of the Lord used on only one occasion in the year, viz. the grand Garuda Sevai day, the third day of the Brahmotsavam, and the Tiruvabishekams of the Lord and his Consorts Sri and Budevis, which are called Kireetams made of precious stones. The author while mentioning the presentation of certain jewels to our Lord by various persons under ‘Jewellery’ does not deem it fit to include some of the most important items. Among the valuable collections of jewels in our Temple, the next most important and precious item after Thoppaharam and Tiruvabis- hekam is the head-wear called ‘Venkatadri Kondai’ offered by the Vaishnavite poet and devotee by name Venkatadriswamy. This is adorned to the Lord on many important occasions and displayed along with the special items of jewellery like Thoppaharam and Tiruvabishekam, to the V. I. P. visitors both foreign and Indian. These omissions of such a marvellous and important items of jewellery, have prompted us to mention and describe them in detail. We have to add some more information regarding the jewels which are of outstanding importance in our Temple. Tiruvabishekams: This crown like head-wear of precious stones is adorned to the Lord and his Consorts (Sri and Budevis) 118 on very many important occasions and especially on the Hastam Star’ days which is also the birth star of our Lord Varadaraja. Thoppa-haram: The name ‘Thoppi’ means cap. The Thoppi- haram has changed into Thoppaharam and then into Thopparam evidently. And this jewel (Thoppaharam) is, as already men- tioned above, adorned to the Lord on only one special occasion viz. the grand Garudotsavam day. Venkatadri Kondai: There flourished in the 19th century an ardent Vaishnavite devotee and a poet by name Venkatadri. His mother-tongue was Telugu as evidenced by his devotional songs in praise of our Lord and the Archamurthis of Srirangam and other sacred places. He seems to have presented first some precious ornaments to Lord Ranganata of Srirangam. Then he came to Kanchi. He wanted to offer a similar head-wear ornament to our Lord also. For this he had to raise donations from the public, since he was not affluent. He took a vow that unless he collects a certain amount each day he would not take his meals. Even if the collections of a day exceeded his target for the day, he would not account it for the next day. That is, he had to collect again the amount he had fixed for every day. Just like this he persevered and was able to complete the task finally. He faced very many difficulties for completing this sacred task. One such difficulty was about his securing back the precious emerald, set in the middle of the front portion of the ornament from a Dasi (dancing girl) at Thanjavur, which was stolen by the goldsmith and given to his sweetheart. It seems that having come to know about the possession of this by the ‘Dasi’ he appealed to her to part with it. She refused at first. But Sri Venkatadri was not to be thwarted in his efforts. He started a fast before her house. Ultimately the lady yielded and returned the precious stone. Subsequently, the two Nachiars Sri Devi and Budevi appeared in the dream of Sri Venkatadri and bade him make similar headwears to them also. Such, is the story attached to this prized possession of the Lord of our Temple. Somehow this has not appealed to Dr. K. V. Raman to make mention of this along with his description of the jewels of our Temple. But he may also be not aware of all this. U Front View of Sri Azhakiyasingar Shrine Sri Azhakiyasingar (Mulavar &amp; Utsavar) (P. 113) (P. 113) L Lord Varada Adorned with the Diamond Vadakalai Tiruman, the Conch &amp; Discus on the Eighth Day Festival of Brahmotsavam. (P. 119)6 119 He has mentioned Urdvapundra’ among the possessions on page 179 as having been presented by Achyutaraya along with Conch and Discus. We cannot expect him to be more explicit in this regard. There are two Vadakalai Urdvapundrams studded with gems and diamonds, one for the Mulavar and the other for the Utsavar. Whereas the Mulavar wears it throughout the year, the smaller Vadakalai Tiruman-Jewel is adorned to the Utsavar Idol only on special occasions along with the Conch and Discus. The Urdhvapundra mentioned is evidently the smaller one of the Utsavar since the Mulavar’s “Diamond Tiruman” was of the early present century, presented by Sri V. V. Srinivasa Aiyangar a former judge of the High court. Clive’s Makara- Kanti was said to have been presented to the Lord, when he chanced to visit Kanchi at the time of a festival probably the Brahmotsavam. He was said to have been very much moved by the enchanting divine beauty of the Lord, and in his admiration gave away this jewel as a presentation, on the spot. This is a pendant jewel, aiso used on important festivals. Mr. Place, the Collector of Chingleput District, in the beginning of the 19th century had presented some important head ornaments, as the author himself has described. These ornaments have to be fixed on the head when the Deity is adorned with a Chikku-Thadu’ (Sai Kondai) or Sevari’ (plaited hair) or ‘Savari pakai’. Anantachar Makara Kanti’ is also a pendant of rare variety adorned on several important occasions. There is a saphire (precious blue stone) carved like a peacock at the lower end of this padakkam which is a rare piece of skilful workmanship. &#34; C A recent addition is another Makara-Kanti’ presented by the 43rd Jiyar of Ahobila Math. One Sri Ramanujachariar who was a Receiver in the Temple in the beginning of this century had presented the gem-set Conch and Discus,3 and also the ‘Tilak ’ to the Utsavar Deity. Echamma Padakkam, and Satyapurnaswamy (Madwa Acharya) Padakkam are among the stock of jewellery in the Temple which also deserve mention. FOOT NOTES">

  <p>CHAPTER-X
PAINTING AND OTHER ARTS
Under &ldquo;General Features&rdquo; In Section I, &ldquo;Places where paintings are found&rdquo; the author calls the sect-marks on the paint- ings on the walls surrounding the central shrine as &rsquo;traces of vandalism&rsquo;. The paintings which are very much decayed and cannot boast of the Ajanta or Ellora type, are not very clear and in most cases completely disfigured due to long age. The author himself concedes this on page 177 where he says most of the colour has vanished or become dull and what remains can only be seen in patches. Vadakalai sect-marks appear on the top of the walls, where the aforesaid paintings exist in a withered state, but they do not in anyway cause damage or disfigurement to the already decayed paintings. This causes a great eyesore to our author naturally because these sect-marks are all Vada- kalai. Such &lsquo;vandalism&rsquo;, if vandalism they could be called is in&rsquo; abundance in Temples like Srirangam, Tiruvallikkeni and so many other Temples of the south where the Tenkalai features are displayed prominently. But they will not create any such impression in the author&rsquo;s mind since these sect-marks belong to his own sect. This is one more instance of the staunch sectarianism exhibited by the author in this book. The interesting point of this remark is that he carefully avoids mentioning them as Vadakalai marks. He simply says &lsquo;caste marks&rsquo; so that he may not commit himself to testify to the existence of Vadakalai sect marks. This is a general policy usually adopted by the members of his sect, not to commit themselves to accept or recognise the existence of Vadakalai marks in the Temple. The use of the
the word caste before the word marks is erroneous. Whether the mark is of the Vadakalai or Tenkalai kind, the mark has nothing to do with caste as it is not worn by the members of a particular caste alone. The urdvapunram as it is worn by the Sri Vaishna- vas belonging to Ramanuja school must be called only creed mark and those of the Vadakalai or Tenkalai shall be called as
sectarian marks.

Section: 2-Wood Carvings&rsquo; (Page 178): It is a welcome silver lining in the clouds to see here the author&rsquo;s saying that &ldquo;in the beginning of the 17th century Ettur Kumara Tatacharya is said to have presented a number of vahanas though the names are not specified&rdquo;. But it is strange how the author says that the names of the vahanas are not specified when he refers to the particular inscription which, mentions this. This inscription &rsquo; specifically details the list of vahanas made by Sri Tatacharya and various other items. They are the Elephant, Horse, Serpent, Garuda, Anjaneya, Sun, Moon, Palanquin, made of pearls and gems, Hamsa &amp; Simha (Lion) all,made of gold and silver. &ldquo;Vahan-rupyai-Swarnai etc&rdquo;. is the sloka.
In the same inscription we get the information of the offering of the gem-set Kiritams, Kavachas and other costly jewels by Sri Tatacharya2. This evidently refers to the &ldquo;Tho- ppaharam&rsquo; a head-wear of the Lord used on only one occasion in the year, viz. the grand Garuda Sevai day, the third day of the Brahmotsavam, and the Tiruvabishekams of the Lord and his Consorts Sri and Budevis, which are called Kireetams made of precious stones.
The author while mentioning the presentation of certain jewels to our Lord by various persons under &lsquo;Jewellery&rsquo; does not deem it fit to include some of the most important items. Among the valuable collections of jewels in our Temple, the next most important and precious item after Thoppaharam and Tiruvabis- hekam is the head-wear called &lsquo;Venkatadri Kondai&rsquo; offered by the Vaishnavite poet and devotee by name Venkatadriswamy. This is adorned to the Lord on many important occasions and displayed along with the special items of jewellery like Thoppaharam and Tiruvabishekam, to the V. I. P. visitors both foreign and Indian. These omissions of such a marvellous and important items of jewellery, have prompted us to mention and describe them in detail. We have to add some more information regarding the jewels which are of outstanding importance in our Temple.
Tiruvabishekams: This crown like head-wear of precious stones is adorned to the Lord and his Consorts (Sri and Budevis)
118
on very many important occasions and especially on the Hastam Star&rsquo; days which is also the birth star of our Lord Varadaraja.
Thoppa-haram: The name &lsquo;Thoppi&rsquo; means cap. The Thoppi- haram has changed into Thoppaharam and then into Thopparam evidently. And this jewel (Thoppaharam) is, as already men- tioned above, adorned to the Lord on only one special occasion viz. the grand Garudotsavam day.
Venkatadri Kondai: There flourished in the 19th century an ardent Vaishnavite devotee and a poet by name Venkatadri. His mother-tongue was Telugu as evidenced by his devotional songs in praise of our Lord and the Archamurthis of Srirangam and other sacred places. He seems to have presented first some precious ornaments to Lord Ranganata of Srirangam. Then he came to Kanchi. He wanted to offer a similar head-wear ornament to our Lord also. For this he had to raise donations from the public, since he was not affluent. He took a vow that unless he collects a certain amount each day he would not take his meals. Even if the collections of a day exceeded his target for the day, he would not account it for the next day. That is, he had to collect again the amount he had fixed for every day. Just like this he persevered and was able to complete the task finally. He faced very many difficulties for completing this sacred task. One such difficulty was about his securing back the precious emerald, set in the middle of the front portion of the ornament from a Dasi (dancing girl) at Thanjavur, which was stolen by the goldsmith and given to his sweetheart. It seems that having come to know about the possession of this by the &lsquo;Dasi&rsquo; he appealed to her to part with it. She refused at first. But Sri Venkatadri was not to be thwarted in his efforts. He started a fast before her house. Ultimately the lady yielded and returned the precious stone. Subsequently, the two Nachiars Sri Devi and Budevi appeared in the dream of Sri Venkatadri and bade him make similar headwears to them also. Such, is the story attached to this prized possession of the Lord of our Temple. Somehow this has not appealed to Dr. K. V. Raman to make mention of this along with his description of the jewels of our Temple. But he may also be not aware of all this.

He has mentioned Urdvapundra&rsquo; among the possessions on page 179 as having been presented by Achyutaraya along with Conch and Discus. We cannot expect him to be more explicit in this regard. There are two Vadakalai Urdvapundrams studded with gems and diamonds, one for the Mulavar and the other for the Utsavar. Whereas the Mulavar wears it throughout the year, the smaller Vadakalai Tiruman-Jewel is adorned to the Utsavar Idol only on special occasions along with the Conch and Discus. The Urdhvapundra mentioned is evidently the smaller one of the Utsavar since the Mulavar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diamond Tiruman&rdquo; was of the early present century, presented by Sri V. V. Srinivasa Aiyangar a former judge of the High court. Clive&rsquo;s Makara- Kanti was said to have been presented to the Lord, when he chanced to visit Kanchi at the time of a festival probably the Brahmotsavam. He was said to have been very much moved by the enchanting divine beauty of the Lord, and in his admiration gave away this jewel as a presentation, on the spot. This is a pendant jewel, aiso used on important festivals. Mr. Place, the Collector of Chingleput District, in the beginning of the 19th century had presented some important head ornaments, as the author himself has described. These ornaments have to be fixed on the head when the Deity is adorned with a Chikku-Thadu&rsquo; (Sai Kondai) or Sevari&rsquo; (plaited hair) or &lsquo;Savari pakai&rsquo;. Anantachar Makara Kanti&rsquo; is also a pendant of rare variety adorned on several important occasions. There is a saphire (precious blue stone) carved like a peacock at the lower end of this padakkam which is a rare piece of skilful workmanship.
&quot;
C
A recent addition is another Makara-Kanti&rsquo; presented by the 43rd Jiyar of Ahobila Math. One Sri Ramanujachariar who was a Receiver in the Temple in the beginning of this century had presented the gem-set Conch and Discus,3 and also the &lsquo;Tilak &rsquo; to the Utsavar Deity. Echamma Padakkam, and Satyapurnaswamy (Madwa Acharya) Padakkam are among the stock of jewellery in the Temple which also deserve mention.

CONCLUSION
Before concluding this Critical Survey we have to mention certain salient features and noteworthy points with regard to Dr. K. V. Raman&rsquo;s partisan assertions. His theory, that our Temple is Tenkalai in character on the basis of certain sculptures of Tenkalai Jiyars (not proved satisfactorily) certain Tirtam Arulappadu held by some Tenkalai personages in the Temple, their Adyapaka right and some Tenkalai sect- marks found here and there, can be easily refuted.
If some two or three small pictures, carved on some pillars indicating a Tenkalai Sanyasin by their dress, among the thousands of sculptures found in the Temple, can make a Temple Tenkalai in character, what about the innumerable Vadakalai features, marks, sculptures and the big idols of Sri Tatadesika and his consort Sri Ammangar who are deified in the Temple on a par with other Alwars and Acharyas ? This great Vadakalai Acharyapurusha popularly called Aiyangar&rsquo;, admittedly the royal guru of the Vijayanagar Kings earned that much of fame and eminence to deserve the exalted and respected place in the Temple to the extent of being deified along with his consort. This is in recognition of his unique services and devotion as a true Vaishnavite, in the line of the great Sriman Natamunikal, Alavandar, Peria Tirumalai Nambikal, Pillan, and Panchamata-banjanam Tatadesika. Just as we witness in these modern times, even in those days many places, villages and streets in and around Kanchi, were named after this great influential figure, like Aiyankarkulam-Aiyankarpalayam Street, Aiyanpettai etc. A street in little Kanchipuram near the Temple, is called Ammangar Street even now, after his consort Ammangar. Can the flimsy instances cited by Dr. K. V. Raman in any way stand in comparison with these great monumental recognitions of Sri Tatacharya &ldquo;evidenced in our, Temple at Kanchi and other places cited above&rdquo;? Is there any sign or single vestige to indicate either of Alagiya Manavala &lsquo;Jiyar or &lsquo;Attan&rsquo; Jiyar in our Temple or at Kanchi as we witness in the
121
case of Sri Tatadesika to testify to the exaggerated claims of the author with regard to their prominence and influence in those days? Can the author produce at least a remote mention of these Jiyars in any of the historical versions to justify his theory of their predominace in the Temple or at Kanchi? Even in a recent thesis on the &ldquo;History of Sri Vaishnavism in the Tamil Country-Post Ramanuja &ldquo;, the Tatacharya family is praised highly for their contribution to the building of temples and the spread of Sri Vaishnavism throughout the country. It is significant that there is not a word about either Alagiya Manavala Jiyar or Attan Jiyar even here.
These overwhelming and unassailable pieces of evidence are more than sufficient to prove that our Temple is funda- mentally Vadakalai in character. The next point, which the author, relies or bases upon, is some Tirtakars of the Tenkalai Sect, for his claim of the Tenkalai preponderance in the Temple. Even here he is sorrowfully in error. The first two Tirtakars in the Temple are admittedly the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The third one, Nallan Chakravarthi belongs to an absentee Telugu Vaishnava in the north whose proxy attends very irregularly. This gentleman has no connection with the local Tenkalai people and the Tenkalais of the locality has no claim to this Tirtam Arulappadu.2 The next one has become extinct which was called the second Chakravarti Tirtam. The fifth one is that of the Prativadi-Bayankaram family. This family was originally a Vadakalai one. Their ancestor Sri Prativadi- Bayankaram Annan was the recognised disciple of both Sri Vedantadesika and his son Nayana Varadacharya. This, the author himself concedes in his Treatise &lsquo;.3 Somehow the
present descendants of Sri Annan are, posing themselves as Tenkalais and certainly the first Tirtams belong only to the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The Sect mark theory is still worse since as already detailed earlier in chapter IV of this book from the Chief Deity onwards down to the utensils used in the Temple for Puja and other purposes do all have only Vadakalai marks. Paintings depicting the Vadakalai Acharyas &rsquo; anecdotes like Nadadur Ammal&rsquo;s Kalakshepa ghosty (Sri Bashya discourses) at the Hill (eastern prakara of the Sanctum
9
122
Sanctorum), Sri Vedantadesika&rsquo;s story of Kanakadara&rsquo; iņ: which he is said to have caused gold pour into the hands of a bachelor who sought his help for getting married, by his prayers to Goddess Mahalakshmi at Sri Perundevi Tayar, Shrine, the unchallengeable proclamation &ldquo;Perumal Koil&rdquo;: Stalam-Vadakalai&rdquo; written on the eastern prakaram of
Hastigiri etc., are all indications of the Vadakalai character of the institution. As against this, the author cannot show even a single piece of Tenkalai feature prominently displayed in any part of the Temple to support his claim except a few marks surreptitiously introduced in certain insignificant corners as observed in our Survey&rsquo; to Chapter VIII. The author has also been laying stress upon the Adyapaka miras (Prabanda- recitals) in the Temple to show that Tenkalai tradition and mode of worship prevail in the Temple, since the Tenkalais of the locality are mirasdars to this service. Just like, the claims and arguments advanced in courts by the Tenkalais, the author also twists the case, causing confusion and misleading the ignorant. The Adyapaka service is one of the many services in the Temple. There are equally if not more important services in the Temple like the Vedaparayana Stotrapata and Mantrapushpa. The Pujas in the Temple are done by the Vadakalai Archakas assisted by the Vadakalai Paricharakas who alone have accessibility into the Garbagraham or Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. The Mantra pushpa service is done by the Vadakalai Tatacharyas who participate in the regular puja, by receiving the Tulasi from the Archaka Paricharakas and after sanctifying it with the sacred recitations connected with Mantrapushpa, returns it through the Paricharaka to the Archaka who in his turn offers it at the Feet of the Lord. This is the most essential part of the ceremony of puja in the temples. Vedaparayana and Prabanda are recited by the respective mirasdars in conjunction with the ordinary worshippers at a distance. The Vadakalai Tatacharyas are the mirasdars of the Vedaparayana service as well as the Stotrapata service. (See also Appendix-E for the details of the various services of the Tatacharyas.)
In the daily pooja of the mornings, Vedaparayana and Prabandas are recited from a distance. But during the evenings
123
of the main daily pujas, there are not recited. Only Mantra- pushpa as aforesaid is done since it is part and parcel of the puja or Tiruvaradana. From the foregoing analysis, it may be observed that the mode of worship is neither Tenkalai nor Vadakalai in the strict sense of the term. It is done as per the Agamas. The theory that because the Tenkalais are the mirasdars of the Adyapaka service the tradition and character of the Temple is Tenkalai, cannot stand the test of scrutiny.
Finally, we have to thank Dr. K. V. Raman himself, since he is responsible for piquing us to produce a categorical and correct account of our Temple from very early times, chrono- logically and especially with reference to the venerable Lakshmikumara Tatadesika&rsquo;s great services to the Temple, as its custodian and in his capacity as the royal guru of the Vijayanagar monarchs. The author&rsquo;s bibliography include certain sectarian books. We need not
We need not pay any heed to the perversion and falsity contained in such books. At the same time we have to caution our readers about this, since the author has made use of them and given them the colour of authority by clubbing these disputable and un- authentic books in his references alongside of authentic texts.

Annamalai University Historical Series - 2.
A History of Gingee and its Rulers,
By C. S. Srinivasachari, M. A., - 1943. Krishnappa Nayaka - Page 120 to 126.
His Zeal for Vaishnavism: Krishnappa Nayaka was a loyal follower of Venkata I in his attitude towards religion, He was a staunch Vaishnavite like his master and did much to spread and foster it. His measures in the Chidambaram temple are sufficient to show his zeal for Vaishnavism.
Father Pimenta, the Jesuit traveller who visited Krishnappa Nayaka at his camp in Chidambaram in 1597 A. D. found him then engaged in the settlement of internal disputes among the managers of the temple. The Chidambaram temple is famous for its great and dominant Saiva shrine of Nataraja, and we find in 1597 A. D. a bitter controversy was raging over the question of whether the shrine of Vishnu should be included within the innermost enclosure of the temple wherein the shrine of Nataraja was located. The main reason for these controversies had to be attributed to the Vijayanagara monarchs who tried to extend Vaishnavism and who were greatly helped by their Guru Tatacharya in this task.
It has been said that Vaishnavism reached its high water- mark in the South India during the time of Venkata I and it is no wonder that Krishnappa Nayaka of Gingee showed great determination in restoring and repairing the Govindaraja Shrine within the Nataraja temple. Pimenta has given a succinct account of what he saw at Chidambaram in 1597 A. D. The following in his observation :-
&ldquo;A great controversy arose whether it was lawful to place the sign of Perumala Vaishnava in the Saiva Temple at Chidambaram. Some refused while the others importunately</h2>
<p>160
urged. The priests of the temple who were the treasurers, were withstanding and threatening, if it were done, to cast themselves down from the top of the temple tower. The Brahmans of the temple swore to do the like after they burned the former. Krishnappa Nayaka was unmoved by such threats and was calmly superintending the repairs that he had ordered at the Vishnu shrine. The construction of the buildings of the shrine was carried on, &lsquo;undaunted by the fierce threats of the opponents. The priests climbed one of the high gopurams of the temple and cast themselves down while the Nayaka was there. Pimenta observed, that twenty people had perished in that precipitation on that day of departure, whereas the Nayak being angry, caused his gunners to shoot at the rest which killed two of them while others fled to different places. A woman also was so hot in the jealous controversy, that she cut her own throat. Naturally Krishnappa Nayaka&rsquo;s anger and his order to shoot at the rest while a few of them threw them-. selves, down from the tower top, cannot be justified at all and can be regarded only as a callous exhibition of sectarian bigotry.
To understand the spirit of the Nayaka in his attitude towards Vaishnavism, a review of the events of the time is essential.
The history of Chidambaram under the Vijayanagara rulers has largely been a period of acute religious rivalry and sectarian disputes between the Saivites and Vaishnavites. The Prapan- namrtam, an orthodox Vaishnava work, refers to the Chola King Krimikanta Kulothunga, who is said to have removed the Govindaraja idol from the Chidambaram Temple. The &lsquo;Kulottunga Cholan Ula&rsquo; and the Raja Baja Cholan Ula&rsquo; refer to the same King who caused the idol to be thrown into the sea. Sri Ramanuja had then established and consecrated the Govindaraja Shrine in the town of Tirupathi in the place of the one at Chidambaram that had been desecrated by the Chola. The later Vaishnava Acharyas had, according to the Prapan- namrtm tried to reconsecrate the deity on a secure basis and translate it to its original shrine with the help of Vijayanagara
161
emperors. Krishnappa Nayaka of Gingee seems to have been one of such men who tried to restore to its former eminence, the old shrine of Govindaraja in the temple. The first three dynasties of rulers of Vijayanagara had been tolerant of both religions.
Foot-note at page 126 - same book.
Thus, in or about the 8th century, the Vishnu Shrine was consecrated by a Pallava ruler; in the first half of the 12th century, it was destroyed by a Chola; in the 16th century it was renovated by a Vijayanagara Emperor and further enlarged by one of his successors in the 17th century.

APPENDIX-C-2
A HISTORY OF GINGEE AND ITS RULERS
By Rao Bahadur C. S. SRINIVASACHARI, M.A.,
Professor of History, Annamalai University
Page 128 Tirumala Tatacharya: The most revered teacher and scholar at his (Venkata&rsquo;s) court was undoubtedly the Tatacharya of tradition. His full name was Ettur Kumara Tirumala Tatacharya. He was also known as Lakshmikumara and Kotikanyadana, evidently suggesting the countless virgins he gave in marriage to learned brahmins. In one record, he is called Venkataraya Tatacharya, the Tatacharya whom King Venkata revered. Several Inscriptions attest to his great influence at Venkata&rsquo;s court. He was the royal guru and officiated at the King&rsquo;s coronation. The King, in the excess of his admiration, is said to have offered him his whole kingdom. He was the manager of the Vaishnava temples at Kanchi, where a number of inscriptions mentioning him have been found on the walls of Arulala Perumal Temple. In 1570, * A. D., he got the Vimana at Tirupati gilded. He weighed himself against gold and silver and used all that wealth in the service of God Varadaraja of Kanchi in erecting the Kalyanakoti Vimana in gold for the Goddess Lakshmi in that famous temple. His gifts of vehicles for the temples, jewels for the deities and agraharas for Brahmans and his digging of the tank, called Tatasamudram after himself, are mentioned in one epigraph in glowing terms. The Kalyanakoti Vimana was finished about 1614 A. D., and was evidently built in emulation of the Punyakoti Vimana set up by King Krishnadeva Raya. The latter was repaired by Tatacharya and regilded by him as it had decayed. There is also a record registering the Hanumat Vimsati, whose image he set up in the tank, now known familiarly as the Ayyankarkulam. dug by him. According to an inscription on the bund of the Tenneri Tank, Chingleput District it seems to have been dug by Tatacharya. He is probably identical with the Tatacharya, mentioned in a record dated 1590 A. D., as the grandson of Ettur Srinivasa Tatarya,
See our note on p. 29 for the exact year&ndash;It is 1630 and not 1570 A.D.
163
and son of Srinivasa. This record registers the grant of a village called Venkatesapura in his favour. His forebears have been connected with the spread of Vaishnavism; and the family claimed descent from Srisailanatha the uncle of the great reformer Ramanuja. He is called in the Dalavai Agraharam grant, as &ldquo;the ornament of the wise&rdquo;. A well- known philosophical work of his is Satvikabrahma-Vidya- Vilasa. A work of the same name in Kannada by Ranga Raja, a Sri Vaishnava poet who lived at the court of Chikka Devas Raja, is known. (See R. Narasimhacharya, Karnataka Kavicharite, II-449-50). It is probably based on Tatacharya&rsquo;s work. He also wrote a work called Panduranga-Mahatmya devoted to the Vittala Temple at Pandharpura in the present Bombay Presidency. This work, however, should be distin- guished from the Telugu work of the same name, the author of which was Tenali Ramakrishna Kavi referred to below. The influence of Tatacharya was evidently felt even by the Jesuit fathers at the court of Venkata. One of these, Father Courtinho, seems to have entirely misunderstood the teacher&rdquo;. (PP. 2223-2225 of the Mysore Gazetteer (New Edition) Vol. II, Part III).
From inscriptions we know that Tatacharya&rsquo;s dates range from Saka 1496 (1574-75 A. D.) to Saka (1552 (1630 A. D.) Two of his ancestors had obtained the favour of King Virupaksha II and lived at his court, according to the Prapannamrtm.
Page 126 (in the same Book).
&hellip;&hellip;and Mahacharya or Doddayacharya, who estabilished the image of Govindaraja at Chidambaram, with the help of Tatacharya.
Page 120 (in the same book).
&hellip;&hellip;The main reason for these controversies (between Saivism and Vaishnavism during Krishnappa Nayaka) had to be attributted to the Vijayanagar monarchs who tried to extend Vaishnavism and who were greatly helped by their Guru Tatacharya.

HISTORY OF MYSORE (1399-1799 A. D)
By C. HAYAVADANA RAO,
Corresponding Member, Indian Historical Records Commission,
-New Delhi. 1943-Bangalore.
Page 246-247: Seringa patam, the capital city, continued to be a flourishing centre of social life, with all its attractions, under Devaraja. Its importance, as the seat of the southern throne (dakshina-simhasana) increased with the fall of Penukonda and the Muhammadan occupation of Vellore, the capitals of the repidly declining Vijayanagara Empire. The systematic adoption of Vijayanagar political ideas and traditions by the Ruling House of Mysore also helped in the same direction. This was made possible by the influence exerted by the celebrated Tatacharya family, particularly by Venkata Varadacharya of Yedur (grandson of Immadi Tirumala Tata- charya of Sri Saila Vamsa and son of Koti Kanyadanam Lakshmikumara Tatacharya, already referred to), who, we learn, proceeded to the court of Seringapatam as the preceptor of Devaraja Wodeyar.
Page 247-Foot-note No. 151: E. C. III (1) TN, 23(1663), 1.37 Agamana Sri-Guru-Narapater Devarajasya, Cf. Rice&rsquo;s rendering of this passage, &ldquo;who was in his assembly as Brihaspati in the assemblage of Gods&rdquo; (I. p. 72, translation), which does not seem to be in Keeping with the text. Members of the Tatacharya family were very influential at the court of Vijayanagar as royal preceptors (NARAPATI-SIMHACHANARYA). Koti Kanya- danam Lakshmikumara Tatacharya, father of Venkata Varada- charya, was himself the preceptor of Venkata I (1586-1614) and was reputed to have given away countless virgins in marriage to learned Brahmans, as his title evidently seems to suggest See Mys. Gaz. II iii 2223-2226. The migration of the family to the court of Seringapatam in the sixties of the 17th century seems significant, generally from the point of view of the continuous course of influence of Vijayanagar traditions on Mysore and

particularly from the point of view of the growth of Sri Vaishnavism in the country. Probably the nucleus of the present Parakala Math at Mysore was laid in the reign of Devaraja Wodeyar.
Page 249&hellip;Foremost among the court scholars at the time was Venkata Varadacharya (of the Tatacharya family) the royal preceptor (guru). He was reputed for his proficiency in logic, philosophy and the sastras (tarka, Vedanta, Sastra-samrajya- dharine) and is referred to as having delivered verses of eulogy on Devaraja (raja-prabhandan-uvacha) when the latter granted him the Nulapura (or Ikkeri) agrahara.
Page 265: the departure of Sri Ranga (VI) towards the south about April 1663; the simultaneous settlement in Mysore of the celebrated Tatacharya family from the court of Vijayanagara&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; all these contributed not a little to steadily enhance the reputation and prestige of Devaraja Wodeyar as a ruler of Mysore.
Page 571: The political centre of gravity was shifting from Penukonda to Seringa patam, this being facilitated to some extent by the migration of the Sri Vaishnava family of royal preceptors of the Aravidu dynasty to the court of Devaraja (1663).

P. 202: &hellip;&hellip; We have information of Kanchi as a town of very considerable importance even in the days of the grammarian Patanjali about the middle of the 2nd century, B. C. Kanchi dominated the division under the Cholas, and probably continued ever since to dominate the region, so that now Tondamandalam generally is understood to have been dominated by Kanchi, and Kanchi and Tondamandalam are. treated as more or less interchangeable terms politically.
P. 204&hellip;..In the Sangam literature, we know of two Tiraiyans, the elder Tiraiyan holding rule in the north at Pavittiri, Reddipalem, in the Gudur Taluk, and the younger or Ilam Tiraiyan, ruling over Kanchi.

P. 209: &hellip;&hellip;The great Nandivarman Pallavamalla was the builder of a great temple to Vishnu in Conjeevaram itself, and his son has left records of his benefactions to the temple at Triplicane and at Tirupathi.

Ramaraya of Vijayanagar
167
&ldquo;It is a well known fact that the Empire of Vijayanagar did suffer vital injury at the so called battle of Talikota much more fittingly Rakshasa Tangadi in 1565. The Empire held out in tact, though from another capital farther to the south and much better placed for defence against the enemies, in Penugonda. The last great ruler who can ever be credited with having succeeded to a great extent in bringing the Empire back to its original greatness was the great Venkatapati-raya, Venkata I of Vijayanagar who ruled from 1586-1614 A.D. As he was usually in residence at Chandragiri for most of the period of his reign, he is sometimes spoken of as the Raja of Chandragiri.

Hiri Timmaraja shifted his capital to Penugonda. He died here leaving 3 sons, Sri Ranga Raya, Ramaraja and Venkatapa- thiraya. Sri Ranga ruled from Penugonda nominally the whole of Telugu country. Ramaraja had for his share the Kannada country with capital at Srirangapatam. Venkatapatideva ruled from Chandragiri over the largest portion of as could appear viz. over the Tonda, Chola and Pandya mandalams. After the death of his brothers the whole empire devolved upon Venkatapatiraya.

&ldquo;At the commencement of the 16th century the Sri Vaish- navas had able leaders who were men of considerable learning. They were men of great tact and possessed much skill in carrying on religious propaganda. According to the Telugu literary tradition, a Sri Vaishnava teacher called Tatacharya was the guru or spiritual adviser of Krishnadevaraya. There appears to have flourished two or three people bearing the name of Tata- charya during the first half of the 16th century. A copy of copper-plate grant noticed in the Mys. Arch. Rep. for 1918 P. 52 mentions Venkata Tatarya (of Sathamarsana gotra Apasthamba Sutra Yajus Sakha son of Ahobilacharya son of Srirangadesika) on whom Krishnaraya conferred some privileges in 1522 A. D. A Kumara Tatacharya of the same Sutra, Gotra and Saka figures in an inscription of Sadasivaraya at Tirupathi dated 1542 A.D. (Tirupathi Devasthanam Epigraphical Report P. 259). The sons of a Nala Tatacharya are mentioned in a grant of Sadasiva&rsquo;s time dated 1569 A. D. Probably the first two records refer to the same person. Who this Tatacharya was, it is difficult to say. The Jiyars of the Ahobila Matha appear to have played an important part in extending the influence of Vaishnavism. Van Satakopa Jiyar the founder of the math seems to have been closely in touch with the religious life in the court. He was the guru of the great poet Allasani Peddanna, the poet laureate of Krishnadevaraya &ldquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Sannidi (Ahobila Math) sources Adi-van-Satakopa-swami, the founder of the Ahobila Math was born in Kali 4480 (1372 A. D.) and lived upto 1451 A. D. (seventy-nine years). The successive pontiffs of the math were all having the prefixes &lsquo;Van-Satakopa&rsquo; attached to their names. The Van-Satakopa Jiyar&rsquo; mentioned as the guru of Alasani pedanna, The poet laureate of Krishnadevaraya&rsquo;s time should therefore be the fourth or fifth pontiff of the Math and not the founder, since Krishnadevaraya&rsquo;s time was 1509-1529 A. D.

Page 195 (n) Mys. Arch. Report for 1925, p. 15. In these copper plate grants dated Salivahana Saka 1212, Vikrama Saka 1012, and Salivahana Saka 1157 referring to the reigns of Bukka Raya and a number of other Kings some interesting details are given as regards the intermarriage among the gauda and the reddi classes, and the different kinds of honours to which they were entitled on festive occasions. These inscrip- tions are rambling epigraphs and are all dated wrongly, and, therefore, untrustworthy. But some of the details are the following: The gaudas, we are told, were given the right of possessing a palanquin carried cross-ways, round umbrella, torch by day, big and little kettle drum, silk flag, turban, gold marriage crown, gold neclace, and shoes of honour. One of them states that a number of reddies (named with descent) of the Sujana-kula and Pembulu gotra, on the Sultan (not named) demanding one of their daughters, migrated (the same night ?) with 101 families and seven elephants to the Nadinigadda country. There they sought to make marriages in Chittalapuri- pattana, but were refused. Whereupon Kondama Nayaka and two others went to Penugonda, and represented the matter to Rama Rayal and Bukka Rayal, who came with an army to Nadinigonda. There they held an enquiry as to why the reddis of Bodipet and Chandragiri declined intermarriages, and sent for their guru Tatacharya, to decide the question. In his presence, the heads of the Sujana-Kula were invested with honours (like those given above) and they agreed to make certain payments (specified) on
on occasion of marriages. E. C. XIII 18, 72, 82, pp. 119, 128, 131 and text pp, 363, 388, 397. See also page 96, p. 132.

Page 9 Cover Page: Venkatapathyraya, generally known as Venkata I is represented by about a dozen inscriptions extending in date from Saka 1514 (1592 A. C.) to Saka 1538 (1616 A. D). He was the fourth son of Tirumala and the youngest brother of Sri Ranga II. From a record from Markapur in the Kurnool Dt. he is seen to have been a subordinate of Sadasivaraya in 1489 (1567 A. C). He was referred by his title alone, viz., Viravasantaraya in two epigraphs from the Salem and North Arcot districts. During the reign of his father Tirumala and his elder brother Sri Ranga II he governed the Chandra- giri Rajya as its Vicerory, as indicated in the Telugu Kavya &ldquo;Vasucharitamu&rdquo; during the time of Sri Ranga and next held &ldquo;Charge of the Udayagiri, Kondavidu and other outlying hill fortresses&rdquo;. He had married five queens. One of whom Krishnamamba or Krishnajiamma was mentioned in No. 97-7.7.
His coronation was performed by ETTUR KUMARA TATACHARYA who had been mentioned in inscription No. 761-T. T. of Saka 1505, falling into the reign of Sri Ranga II. On Venkata&rsquo;s accession to the Karnataka throne, he transferred the seat of his government from Penugonda to Chandragiri. Having been initiated by his GURU Kumara Tatacharya, he became an ardent vaishnava and encouraged the propagation of Vaishnavism. He was a staunch devotee of Sri Venkateswara. As a memorial of his Bhakti, a copper statue of his with folded hands and palms joined in a prayerful aspect is found on the south side within the inner front Mantapam adjoining the entrance PADIKAVALI GOPURAM of the temple of Sri Venkateswara at Tirumala with the name &ldquo;Venkatapathirayulu&rdquo; incised in Telugu characters on the right shoulder. The figure appears to be muscular in form and of ordinary stature, but the warrior in the King is not prominent as in the statue of Krishnaraya placed in a group with his two queens on the north side of the same mantapam.

P. 1060: According to the Gangadarapratapavilasam, not only the Sultan of the Deccan&rsquo; but also the Gajapati&rsquo; of Orissa sustained a defeat at the hands of Deva Raya II. The exact circumstances surrounding this event are not known. Kapilaswara Gajapati seized the throne of Orissa in 1434. Probably he made an attack upon the Reddis of Rajahmundry, who in their defence sought succour from their ally, the ruler of Vijayanagar. The victory of Deva Raya II over Kapileswara saved the Reddi Kingdom from immediate annihilation.
Deva Raya II was the greatest ruler of the Sangama dynasty. He is sometimes called Immadi Deva Raya. He is distinguished in inscriptions by the title of Gajabetekara&rsquo; i.e., &rsquo; elephant-hunter&rsquo;. He not only maintained the territorial integrity of the empire, but also secured for it the natural frontier of the Krishna river in the north-east by annexing the kingdom of Kondavidu. According to Nuniz, the Kings of Quilon, Pulicot, Pegu and Tenasserim paid tribute to him. The levy of tribute from Ceylon is confirmed by an inscription at Nagar (M. E. R. 144 of 1916) Para 60.
Page 1096-97: Venkata II was the greatest sovereign of Aravidu dynasty, a man of ability and character. By his military genius and statesmanship, he succeeded in retaking the lands that had been lost in the days of his predecessor. He raised the status of the Empire in the eyes of the foreigners so that &lsquo;several embassies&rsquo; visited Chandragiri in 1604 and presented themselves at his court. He was also in direct correspondence with Philip III of Spain. According to one
174
&lt;
Portuguese reporter, he was a lord of great authority&rsquo;, prudence and understanding as much as any European; Almost all the Portuguese and Hindu authorities pay a tribute to his wisdom and valour, his generosity and love of learning. He was not behind any ruler of Vijayanagar in his liberal donations to brahmans and temples. More than this, although himself a staunch Vaishnava, yet he welcomed the Jesuit fathers to his court at Chandragiri in 1598 and granted them complete freedom to preach their religion and erect Churches throughout his dominions. He held disputations on God, Phliosophy and Mathematics with the teachers or Philosophers almost everyday. The protagonists of Vaishnavism, Saivism and Christianity vied with one another to convince him of the superiority of their respective creeds and he gave them all a patient hearing. Himself a great scholar, he was devoted to the protection of the learned&rsquo;. Eminent Philosophers like Tatacharya, and poets, like Chennamaraju, Matla Ananta and Tarigoppula Mallanna adorned his court. With a view to foster learning, he and the Nayaka of Madura endowed several colleges for the maintenance of professors and students who were supplied with victuals, cloths and everything they needed&hellip; His copper statue in the Tirupathi temple is another proof of his artistic taste.

PROENZA gives a picturesque account of the religious exercise of Vijayaraghava: &ldquo;The Nayaka of Tanjore spends the whole of December in the midst of his idols. Two hours before sunrise he wakes upto go to the sanctuary of Mannar, which is his place of delight; he remains there five hours wholly engaged in shedding on the God&rsquo;s head a continuous stream of sweet-smelling flowers; the cultivators of the environs have been ordered to bring them from hour to hour, so that they might always be fresh. While the prince offers this sacrifice in his mysterious solitude, the whole town takes part in this noisy solemnity. Fireworks, cannon, musical instruments, in a word, all the uproar of a diabolical festival excites the enthusiasm of the spectators&hellip; Here is what he never misses to celebrate in honour of his spiritual master. The guru (Kumara Tatacharya) is seated in a niche richly adorned and carried by the dames of the court; in another niche, shining with gold and precious stones, are placed the slippers of the guru, and the King, going on foot, a censer in hand, precedes the slippers and the censers during the whole

&ldquo;The King allows such freedown that everyman may come and go and live according to his own creed without suffering any annoyance, and without enquiry whether he is a Christian.

He and Sadasiva visited Srirangam. Achyuta and Ramaraja, another good Vaishnava are said to have reinstalled God Govindaraja in the temple at Chidambaram, though that pious work had been done by General Gopana about 1370. Like Devaraya II, Ramaraja saw to it that the Koran was placed before himself when Muslim soldiers rendered obeisance to him. He would not interdict the sacrifice of cows by Muslims in the city of Vijayanagar, though opposition to that practice was voiced by his brother Tirumala, because he was against any interference in their religious observances. Tirumala and Sriranga I were devoted to Vishnu. Venkata I co-operated with his guru Tatacharya who was active in the propagation of Vaishnavism. The sectarian strife of the age was witnessed at Chidambaram. Appaiya Dikshita was an apostle of Saivism. Madhva teachers like Vyasathirtha flourised in the first half of the sixteenth century. Vaishnavism made much progress and triumphed in its struggle with Saivism. The feudatory dynasties were Vaishnava with the exception of the Nayakas of Ikkeri and Vellore and a few others.

Extract from Sri K. N. Shrinivasan&rsquo;s book &ldquo;An Examination of Dr. Raman&rsquo;s theory on the character of the Temple &ldquo;.
66
&hellip;&hellip;
Page 35: The Tatacharyas &hellip;.But Dr. Raman would introduce Tatacharya&rsquo;s family in a most casual way. The name of Ettoor Tirumalai Tatacharya is mentioned at Page 88 with the paranthesis, &ldquo;who probably belongs to the Vadagalai School&rdquo;. When making mention of Lakshmikumara Tata- charya, he would state that &ldquo;he was said to be the descendant of Tirumalainambi family&rdquo;, at Kumbakonam and that he was adopted by Tatacharya. Dr. Raman&rsquo;s attempt is to paint Tatacharya as though he was a scholar from Andhra who approached the Rajas of Vijayanagara for patronage and settled at Kanchi. Further, Dr. Raman would state, that by Attan Jiyar agreement, Tatacharyas are given certain honours just because one of their progenitors had the royal patronage of Vijayanagar Kings. Tatacharyas do not deserve such a casual treatment from Dr. Raman. The greatness of the family and their pride of place cannot be denied by any Srivaishnava. If Tatacharyas were and are honoured today, it was and is not because one in the family had, at some point of time, been the guru of Vijayanagara Kings, but because the family had a pride of place and its members belong to a continuous line of great scholars who have contributed substantially to the religion. In literal terms, Nathamuni and Yamunacharya were founders; Tirumalainambi and Pillan were the interpretors of the religion. The heritage did not become forgotton after Pillan, but there have been many illustrious Acharyas as successors. The junior Tirumalainambi, Tirumalai Srinivasacharya, a famous disciple of Vedanta Desika and his son Tirumalaiappan who was the Sthana Samayadhikari of Kanchi temple are equally famous. The eleventh descendant from Tirumalai Srinivasacharya was Kandanur Tatacharya whose son Tatacharya became the Guru and Acharya of Vijayanagar Kings. This Tatacharya wrote PANCHAMATHA BHANJANAM and he is exclaimed by Appayya Dikshita as the proselytiser of the subjects to Vaishnava religion,
16
178
The contribution Tatacharyas have made to the cause of Sri Vaishnavism can never be overestimated. It is not as though by a mere accident that the grandparent of Lakshmikumara Tatadesikan solicited the patronage of King Virupaksha of Vijayanagar or that his parent Panchamatha Bhanjanam Tatacharya rose to importance as the &lsquo;rayaguru&rsquo;.
Any historian in the place of Dr. Raman would have been more charitable to the Tatacharyas, but Dr. Raman&rsquo;s mission would not be discharged if he was also charitabale! On page 84, Dr. Raman records that Lakshmikumara Tatacharya&rsquo;s son Kumara Tatacharya went to the Devaraya Wodeyar&rsquo;s court at Srirangapatnam to seek better fortunes&rdquo;, His movement was not because chances were bleak in Vijayanagar court. Not did the movement just bring to Kumara Tatacharya personal gains. The members of the Tatacharya family, whenever possible, obtained vulnerable positions as preceptors to royal families and employed such positions not for personal ends but solely for the expansion of Ramanuja darsanam and for the improvement of Vishnu temples. The savants of the Advaita School like Y. Mahalinga Sasthri (a descendant of Appayya Dikshita) admit that if Tatacharya was not there, Vaishnavism could have been wiped out..
A scion of the agnates of Lakshmikumara Tatacharya, known as Kumara Tatadesikan became the preceptor of the Naiks of Thanjavur; he was made the Vaidika-vicharini karta for all the temples in Cholamandala. This is evidence by the books written by the queen of Raghunatha Naick and also borne out by copper plates. He had the title, &ldquo;Chatturveda Satakrathu &quot; among whose descendants are there numerous scholars in recent times also &ldquo;.
&ldquo;Another group of Tatacharyas settled at Srirangam. Known as the &lsquo;Mudhal Tirimaligai&rsquo; Tatacharyas, they did not lag behind the other branches in propagating Srivaishnavism and increasing its votaries. Their scions have performed &lsquo;PANCHASAMSKARA&rsquo; to families of royal descent in Gujarat and Rajasthan including the princes of Jodhpur. They have dedicated the munificence showered on them by the princes for construction of temples. It must not be forgotton179
that the glory and the capacity of the Thanjavur and the Srirangam lines did not depend or flow from the importance of the &lsquo;rayaguru&rsquo; line.
The Tatacharya family, which has given birth to more scholars and savants of Vaishnavism than probably all the other families have given together, should not have been treated so lightly by a historian like Dr. Raman unless his main aim is, as it appears to be, to detract the achievements of this illustrious family.
Even now, in any congregation whether it be a marriage or other function, it is a Tatacharya who is given the first thamboolam - not because one Tatacharya was at sometime a Rayaguru, but because he is a descendant of a family which from the beginning till date has been the founders, preservators and expositors of Vaishnava religion&rdquo;.

T. He was the son of Aiyavayyangar and the grandson of Tolappacharya of Sathamarshana Gotra, Apasthamba Sutra and Yajus Sakha. In Saka 1505, Subhanu, Kanya (25-9-1583 A. C), he granted four villages to the temple yielding an aggregate annual income of 720 rekhai, viz., Ayyanpakkam with 330 rekhai, Pisattur with 210 rekhai and Pulivayi with 30 rekhai situated in the Palavettuchchirmai in the Terku- maganai, and Mullaivayi in Tulaiparivayisirmai with 150 rekhai. The expenditure for this amount of 720 rekhai consisted of daily and occasional offerings for Tiruvenkatamudaiyan. The value of each pongal-tirupponakam is stated to have been 2 panam, that of two palams of chandanan 3/16 panam and that of 100 betel-nuts and 200 leaves one panam.&rdquo;
Kumara Tatacharya belonged to the family of &ldquo;Srisaila- nathan, better known by his familiar name Periya Tirumalai Nambi&rdquo;, who &ldquo;was the maternal uncle of the great Srivaishnava acharya Ramanuja, and also one of the five disciples of Yamunarya, who was the immediate guru of Ramanuja&rdquo; (Ep. Ind. Vol. XII, Page 162). He was the son of Aiyavayyangar as mentioned in our inscription No. 671-T. T.

and in Nos. 30, 31 and 32 of 1921 (Ma d. Ep. Rep. for 1921, para 53). The father &lsquo;Ayyavayyangar is called Ettur Tirumalai Kumbakonam Tatachariyar Ayyavayyangar in No. 31 of 1921. The inscriptions of our collection furnish us with the ancestry of Kumara Tatacharya for three generations extending to the time of Mallikarjuna of the first dynasty of Vijayanagara. As noted above, Kumara Tatacharya was the son of Ayyavayyangar and the grandson of Tolappacharya ; and this Tolappacharya or Tolappar-Ayyangar is represented as the son of Sottai Tirumalainambi Tiruvenkata Tatayyangar and as the one of the acharyapurushas inhabiting the Tirupati agaram, in No. 98-G. T. dated in Saka 1385, Subhanu, Mina (=7—3—1464 AC), falling into the reign of Mallikarjuna Nos. 347 and 574-T. T. dated in Saka 1397, Manmatha, Kanya (-24-9-1475 AC), bring to notice another son of Sottai Tiruvenkata-Tatayyangar, viz., Kamara-Tatayangar, who was perhaps younger than Tolappacharya, and who was the acharya of Sriman Nrisimba-Prabhu entitled &ldquo;Gayigovala&rdquo;, the conqueror of the Pandya King and the establisher of the Kakatiya Kingdom, and of his brother Kesaya Nayaka entitled &ldquo;Tribhuvanaraja&rdquo; (page 139 ante). Kumara Tatayyangar is again mentined in No. 142-G. T. of Saka 1410, Kilaka, Simha (=12-8-1488 AC) which registers a provision for offerings for Sri Govindaraja on the day of his birth star Puram (Pubba) occurring each month, and in No. 307-T. T. of Saka 1415, Pramadicha, Tula (-17-10-1493 AC), recording a similar provision for offerings for both Sri Venkatesa and Sri Govinda- raja in his own name and in that of his disciple Kumara- Kulasekhara-Mediniravu Timma Nayakkar (page 149 ante). This Kumara Tatayyangar&rsquo;s son was Tirumalai-Tatayyangar who is stated in No. 421-T. T. dated in Saka 1463, Plava, Kumba (10-2-1542 AC), during the reign of Achyutaraya, to have been the guru of Singaraja, son of Salakayyadeva Maharaja (page 222 ante). We thus obtain a glimpse of four generations of the junior line from the same Tiruvenkata Tatayyangar to Tirumalai Tatayyangar.
From the Conjeevaram inscriptions we find that Kumara Tatacharya&rsquo;s dates range between Saka 1496, Bhava
182
&hellip;
(1574-75 AC) (No. 383 of 1910), falling into the reign of Sriranga II, and the cyclic year Pramoduta (Saka 1552- 1630 AC), which records the construction of a Vimana by Tatacharya at Phanipatigiri (i. e. Tirupati). It is unquention- ably this Kumara Tatacharya that &ldquo;repaired and regilt the Punyakotivimana which was originally erected by Krishnaraya and which had become dilapidated&hellip; and also erected the Kalyanakoti Vimana and had it also gilt with gold&rdquo;, in Saka 1536, Ananda, Mesha (=2—4—1614 AC), as reported in Nos. 649 and 650 of 1919. Having basked in the sun of royal favour of King Venkatapathy, to whom he was the spiritual guru who officiated at his coronation, and who in his excess of admiration for his Acharya is said to have offered the whole Kingdom to him, he &ldquo;lived in kingly splendour at Conjeevaram at the latter part of his life&rdquo;. The inscriptions of Conjeevaram mention him &ldquo;as the manager-general of the temple affairs (Sri Karya-dhurandhara) with a staff of subordinates under him&rdquo;, and he supervised other Vaishnava temples in the Chingleput District. He is reported &ldquo;In. No. 363 of 1919 to have weighed himself separately against gold and silver and to have used all that wealth in the service of Varadaraja in erecting the Kalyanakoti-vimana in gold for the goddess Lakshmi in the same temple. In the Sanskrit verses contained in No. 475 of 1919, his gifts of all the necessary vahanas (vehicles) in gold and silver,, of the elephant, the horse, the snake, the garuda, hanuman, the palanquin the swan and the lion, and of certain other costly jewels and ornaments to the god, his founding of beautiful agraharas for brahmins and the digging of a tank called Tatasamudram are mentioned in glowing terms&rdquo; (Mad. Ep. Rep. for 1920, para 51). This same Kumara Tatacharya or Tirumala Tatacharya is also mentioned to have performed the coronation of Peda Venkata- pathi or Venkata II, the elder son of Ranga IV who was a son of aliya-Ramaraja.
As noted above, the period of Kumara Tatacharya&rsquo;s activities extends from 1574-75 AC to 1630 AC, i. e. over 55 years, as gleaned from lithic records; and as remarked in the Ar. Sur. Rep. for 1911-12, page 191, foot-note 2, &ldquo;it is not impossible the Vaishnava teacher Tirumala Tatacharya, who
183
performed the coronation of Venkata I, should have lived to the time of Venkata II&rdquo;. We have seen that Kumara Tatacharya&rsquo;s grandfather Tolappacharya lived during the reign of Mallikarjuna and the maximum intervening period between the time of Tolappacharya and Tatacharya is 168 years from Saka 1385 to Saka 1552, while the minimum period is 112 years upto Saka 1496, the date of Kumara Tatacharya&rsquo;s earliest record No. 383 of 1919. Out of these 168 years we observed Kumara Tatacharya carrying on his activities for a third of that period, i. e., for 55 years, and the remaining 112 years might have been thus lived by his grandfather and father, Tolappa- charya from the reign of Mallikarjuna to about the middle of Krishnaraya&rsquo;s time until about 1520 AC and Aiyavayyangar from 1520 to 1570 AC into the early years of Sriranga&rsquo;s reign. It is thus possible that each member of this senior line lived on for five to six decades, exclusive of the overlapping time during which both the father and the son in each case might have lived together. And inclusive of this overlapping period each individual&rsquo;s full age would have lasted from eighty to ninety years, just as Talapaka Annamayyangar had lived for ninety six years. And it is reasonable to believe that Kotikanyadanam Lakshmi Kumara Tatacharya alone regilt the Anandanilaya- vimanam of the central shrine of Venkatapati (Venkatesa) abiding on the Phanipattgiri (Seshadri, the Hill which in form looks like a coiled serpant) in the cyclic year Pramaduta corresponding to Saka 1552 (=1630 AC) which possibly the first year of the reign of King Venkata II whom the acharya crowned during that year and whose presents on the occasion he probably utilised for the gilding of the Anandanilaya Vimana of Sri Venkateswara, just as he used the gold and silver against which he weighed himself &ldquo;in erecting the Kalyanakoti vimana in gold for the goddess Lakshmi&rdquo; at Conjeevaram and in regilding the Punyakoti vimana of Varadarajaswami, in Saka 1536, Ananda, Mesha, (-2-4-1614 AC) (Nos. 650, 649 and 363 of 1919). For a successor of this Kumara Tatacharya, viz., Ettur Immadi Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya, appears four years later in Saka 1556, Yuva, Simha (=30-8-1635 AC), falling into the reign of Venkatapatiraya II (No. 201 of 1922)&hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo;

Origin of the name &lsquo;Ayyangarkulam.&rsquo;
Page 7: &ldquo;The legend is woven round a signal event which took place in the life of a devout Vaishnavite Brahmin known as Kodi Kannikadanam Thathachari and Kulam he excavated with the temple overlooking it. The tank of the temple is held in great veneration by the villagers and since the tank adjoining the temple was excavated by this Ayyangar, they named the village Ayyangarkulam &ldquo;.

When Lord Varadaraja Perumal, the principal Deity at Kanchipuram is brought to this village and immersed in a well adjacent to the temple attracting a very large congregation of people both within the village and from surrounding areas, sometimes even from Madras, people tend to forget their differences and get together during this festival to invoke the blessings of the Lord&rdquo;.

Page 93 (144) &ldquo;The Nadapavi Utsavam owes its origin to a person who was a resident of Kanchipuram Taluk named Kodikannikadanam Thathachariar and the money he collected for Varadaraja Perumal temple with which he excavated a tank and built a temple in honour of Lord Anjaneya, popularly known as Hanuman who saved him from dacoits. Alive to the fact that the money was originally collected on behalf of Lord Varadaraja Perumal, it was agreed upon by the devotees of the Lord that he should be taken on his birthday to Ayyangarkulam. Since Lord Varadaraja is supposed to have been born with Agni (Fire) He is taken to the Mandapam inside the Nadapavi well during the festival&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; The descendants of Kodi Kannikadanam Tathachariar who are living in Kanchipuram to this day celebrate the festival every year during the month of &ldquo;Chitrai&rdquo; corresponding to April-May of the calendar year on the Full Moon Day&hellip;&hellip;&rsquo;
39
Page 95 (150) &ldquo;The tank and the temple were built by an Ayyangar named Kodi Kannikadanam Thathachariar. Many stories are current about this Ayyangar&rsquo;s devotion, piety and his munificence but the most important relates to
his celebration of a number of marriages for poor couples unable to meet the marriage expenses at his own cost. Since he made &lsquo;Kannika Danams&rsquo; meaning the gifting of virgins to bride- grooms, he was Hyperbolically called Kodi Kannikadanam Thathachariar. Roughly 500 years back, this devotee along with his retinue went on a fund raising tour to several places for the benefit of Lord Varadaraja Perumal, the principal deity at Kanchipuram. After visiting many places and collecting adequate sums he and his retinue were returning to Kanchi- puram. When they neared the spot where the present Ayyangarkulam is now situated, then merely a forest area the sun had set and with darkness engulfing them, they decided to spend the night at this place. During the night dacoits who heard of Thathachariar and the money in his possession, came to the spot where he and his party had camped with the intention of robbing him. The Thathachariar
17
186
prayed to Lord Anjeneya to protect him and his party from the dacoit, and legend has it that Lord Anjeneya constructed a fort around Thathachariar and his men with his tail till the morning. The decoits who had come there were also blinded by Divine Grace. Thathachariar on having shown the blind dacoits beseeched Lord Anjaneya to restore their sight which the latter was kind enough to grant. Thereupon in honour of Hanuman and as his humble thanks for the succour rendered to him, Thathachariar started to construct a permanent monument for Lord Anjaneya and hit upon the idea of digging a tank at the exact spot where a fort was built by Divine Grace. The money collected on behalf of Lord Varadaraja was spent in digging the tank and building a temple dedicated to Lord Anjaneya. The temple however, is not called the Anjaneya Temple, but the Sanjeevarayar temple because of a legend connected with the Ramayana. The villagers have, however, linked the story from the epic to their own village in the following manner. They informed us that this legend has been handed down from generation to generation in the village and therefore they believe it to be true. It is said that there was a small hillock adjacent to the place where the present tank is situated. Boulders were taken from it to form the bund of the tanks. Legend has it that at the time when Rama was fighting with Ravana to rescue Sita, Rama&rsquo;s brother Lakshmana tried to protect Rama and became mortally wounded from the arrow aimed at Lakshmana and his followers by Indrajit, son of Ravana. It was then found that unless certain medicinal herbs were brought from the Sanjeevi Mountain Lakshmana and others would certainly die. Anjaneya being the only person capable of traversing this distance undertook to bring the herbs, but on reaching the Sanjeevi mountain, he was unable to distinguish between one plant and another. He thereupon tore out the entire mountain and flew with it on his palm. When he was flying over the spot where the tank is now situated he is said to have transferred the mountain from one palm to the other. During this transfer a small portion of the mountain is said to have fallen down and formed the hillock from which the boulders were taken to form the bund of the tank. Hence the temple came to be called the Sanjeevarayar temple. It must not, however, be
187
forgotten that Sanjeevarayar is another name for Lord Anjaneya and it is quite possible that this temple might have been known as Sanjeevarayar temple, in honour of Lord Anjaneya, rather than due to this story about a portion of Sanjeevi mountain falling near this village.
Page 95: (151) The temple itself is a beautiful monu- ment though comparatively neglected but in spite of its neglect and disuse, one can very well visualise its architectural beauty etc., etc.
Page 97
(154) Chapter VI Conclusion:
(154) &ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;we have seen how the village got this quaint name through the Sanjeevarayar Temple and the tank over looking it, excavated by Kodi Kannikadanam Thathachariar. The village boasts a famous festival the &ldquo;The Nadapavi Utsavam &quot;
which attracts people from all over
the countryside etc., etc.
APPENDIX-D
THE UNIQUE AND EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES &amp; HONOURS ENJOYED BY SRI VEDANTA DESIKA&rsquo;S DEITIES OF
KANCHI IN OUR TEMPLE
During the Brahmotsavam, the Lord presents Himself on the Garuda Vahana, in Nachiyar Tirukkolam and in Punyakoti Vimanam (on the Sravana Tirtavari Day) at Tuppul and special honours from the Lord are bestowed on Sri Desika on every-one of these occasions. On the latter two occasions the Lord alights at the Tuppul Shrine for a grand Astanam. In fact, during all the perambulations of the Lord both in the morning and night of the Brahmotsavam He is taken purposely through the Vilakkoli Koil to facilitate Sri Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s worship of the Lord. Again on the day of Anushtanakulam Utsavam the Lord with Sri Udayavar alights at the shrine on their way back from Anushtanakulam. Special honours of parivattam, garland and Sri Satari are shown at the times of entry and exit on this day with Darsana Tambulam Astanam and distribution of Thirta Prasadams. On the Chitra Pournami day also, during the return procession of the Lord, honours are bestowed on Sri Desika.
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SRI TUPPUL VEDANTA DESIKA&rsquo;S MANGALASASANAM
On the Purattasi Sravanam day, the birthday of Sri Tuppul Vedanta Desika, a very big festival called the Mangalasasanam, is celebrated at our Temple. A golden palanquin and other paraphernalia are sent to Tuppul, the birth-place of Sri Desika from our Temple to bring him. On this morning Sri Desika comes in this golden palanquin to our Temple in a very grand possession, for the Mangalasasanam.
At the entrance of the Temple, our Temple authorities and Archaka-Paricharakas take charge of the Deity of Vedanta Desika. The Adyapakam and the Vedaparayanam goshtis finish their recitals near the hundred-pillared Mantapa inside the Temple. Sri Desika then proceeds to the Temple Desika&rsquo;s189
shrine and alights there. Before alighting, Darsanatambulam is offered and garland and Satari honours are shown to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar who are enshrined there.
From the golden palanquin he is shifted to a golden &ldquo;Kaithalam&rdquo; for proceeding inside the Temple for Mangala- sasanam. The procession from Sri Desika&rsquo;s shrine starts with Stotrapaatam composed by Sri Desika. Around the Deity &lsquo;Kattiyams&rsquo; (Stotrams) in praise of Sri Desika are also recited by a select few. Throughout this Mangalasasanam festival, from the time Sri Desika enters the Temple and leaves it again in the evening, Stotras composed by him alone are recited.
The first shrine Sri Desika worships after entering the Tondaradippodi gate is that of Sri Rama. Here, &ldquo;Raguveera Gatyam&rdquo; and other Stotras in praise of Sri Rama are recited. After the usual honours of Thirtam, Satari, Garlands, etc., Sri Desika, comes out to proceed to Sri Thayar&rsquo;s Shrine through the &ldquo;Yamunaituraivar Tirumurram&rsquo; or Madapalli Prakaram. Before reaching Sri Tayar&rsquo;s Shrine, he worships Sri Anantalwar, Sri Karumanicka Perumal, the Nachiyars of Madappalli (Kitchen) and Ugraanam (Store Room), who are all enshrined around in the Prakaram.
There is one Krishna&rsquo;s Shrine in the front Mantapa of Sri Tayar&rsquo;s Shrine. After worshipping Sri Krishna with &lsquo;Gopala Vimsati&rsquo; etc., Stotras and receiving honours he enters the Sanctum Sanctorum of Goddess Perundevi. The Mangala- sasanam here is a bit more elaborate than in the previous Shrines. Sristuti, etc. are recited here. After the usual honours from Sri Perundevi Tayar he comes outside through the inner Prakara Pradakshanam and stands in the Kolappadi in the front Mantapa of the Shrine where Thirtam and Satari are offered to the Stothrapaata Goshti.
The procession of Sri Desika from Sri Tayar&rsquo;s shrine to the HASTIGIRI, then starts. On the way, he worships Sri Garudlawar, Sri Alagiasingar, Sri Andal, Sri Vishwaksena and Sri Danvantrin and finally ascends the steps of &lsquo;VARANAGIRI&rsquo;, In the innermost eastern prakaram of the Hill he prostrates before the Ammal Goshti&rsquo; portrayed on the ceiling, and then enters the Sanctum Sanctorum (Garbagraham) of the Lord.
190
The Lord, on this day, is adorned with special precious jewels, lace vastras and garlands with
and garlands with &ldquo;Seviri Kondai and &ldquo;Kodali Mudichu &ldquo;. The darsan of the Lord Perarulala at this time will be enchanting. As soon as Sri Desika enters the Garbagraham, he is placed under the Feet of the Lord and His Nachiars. An elaborate soul stirring Mangalasasanam with the Stotrams composed by him in praise of the Lord, will take place. This Mangalasasana seva or darsan with Sri Desika remaining in the same position will last for a few hours to facilitate public worship. After that Sri Desika will come out and stand in the &ldquo;Kolappadi facing the Lord. Here the parivattam Lace Duppatta (Vastram) garlands and Satari honours will be bestowed with the usual Kattiyams. After goshti thirtam and Satari here, Sri Desika will be taken to the &ldquo;Kachi Voithan&rdquo; Mantapa situated in the eastern prakaram. After Nivedanam and distribution of prasadams, there will be a grander procession of the Lord with Sri Desika facing Him with Anjali Hasta, down the Hill. Tears of joy will not fail to swell the eyes and hairs will stland on their ends to those who have experienced this thrilling &ldquo;Seva&rdquo;. The heavenly beauty of the Lord and His Bakta at this time has got to be only enjoyed personally and it will be a futile exercise to attempt to describe this superb occasion either by words or writing.
The procession will move slowly and reach the Abisheka Mantapa finally. Before that, Sri Tayar also will join the Lord near Her shrine, if the day happens to be a Friday.
At the Abisheka Mantapa parting honours are shown to Sri Desika with the recital of select slokas and &ldquo;Pushpa Vrishti&rdquo;. Sri Desika will then move slowly backward facing the Divya- dampatis until he comes out of the Tondaradippodi. The Divine pair will also be bestowing their Divya darsan on their Bakta until he comes out. The curtain of the Abisheka Mantapa will be drawn only that after.
With the Stotrapata goshti Sri Desika will then be taken round the Alwar prakaram where he will worship Chakkara- talwar, Sri Nammalwar, Sri Udayavar and other Alwars and Acharyas with the relevant stotras and receive the usual honours from them. Before alighting at the Desika&rsquo;s shrine, he will be
191
taken inside the shrine submerged in the garlands, he had received from the various Deities he worshipped and with the parivattam and Tagadi, for giving his darsan to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. After honouring them he will come out and be placed in the palanquin, now decorated beautifully with flowers.
This return Valampuri procession will go round the four mada streets before reaching Tuppul in the night.
After this magnificent Mangalasasanam occasion there will be the usual Satumurai&rsquo; festival to the Temple Desika. When Sri Perumal comes out for it, Sri Desika will join Him after the usual honours to accompany Him in the procession upto the Tiruvadi Koil and then round the Alwar prakaram during the return procession. Before alighting at the shrine there will be the usual Veda Satumurai and Darsana Tambulam and honours. No other Bakta Vigraha with the exception of Sri Senai Mudaliar (Viswaksena) has this privilege of accompanying the Lord outside the Temple on the annual Tirunakshatram festivals.
One other instance. Sri Andal or Goda is taken to Sri Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s shrine on the Bogi Tirukkalyanam day for the ceremonial&rdquo; Feast&rdquo;. Here, after showing the honours to Sri Desika, Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar, Sri Andal alights and a grand Alankara Tirumanjanam (ceremonial bath) takes place followed by Puja and Astanam. After Nivedanam and distribution of Tirtam and Prasadams to the goshtis She will be taken inside the shrine and seated at the place of Sri Desika&rsquo;s Utsavar Idol, while Sri Desika will be placed, at Her Feet. She will be there till the Lord comes there in the evening for the Tirukkalyana Mahotsavam. As soon as the Lord turns towards the shrine Sri Andal will join Him, and Both, after bestowing honours on Sri Desika and others will start in procession.
There is a shrine for Sri Vedanta Desika at Srirangarajavidi near the Temple to the south. This Desika also is the recipient of honours from our Lord during the return processions on the Seevarotsavam and Vanabojanam festival days. During the latter occasion, the Lord alights at this shrine and the final Puja of the day itself takes place here with &lsquo;Astanam,&rsquo; and special honours to Sri Desika.
APPENDIX-E
A DESCRIPTION OF THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE TATACHARYAS IN THE TEMPLE WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE
The descendants of Sri Kotikannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika have got certain valuable rights and privileges in the Temple. Some of the precious heritages are given below with their significance and importance.</p>
<ol>
<li>They are the &ldquo;Agratambulam-dars&rdquo; of the Temple by which they are entitled to receive the First Tirtams, Garlands, Satari, Parivattams, Prasadams, etc. honours on all occasions of Pujas, Festivals, Goshtis, Astanams, etc. when they are distributed either publicly or privately.</li>
<li>They are the persons who receive the Lord and His Consorts on behalf of all the Alwars and Acharyas at the entrance of their Shrines on their annual Tirunakshatram days, with the chanting of Vedas. This service which is called the &ldquo;Darsana-Tambulam&rdquo; also takes place at the time of Sri Andal&rsquo;s visit to Sri Desika and Sri Tatadesika&rsquo;s shrine on the Bogi Tirukkalyanam day for the &ldquo;Feast&rdquo; and when Sri Tuppul Vedanta Desika alights at the Shrine on the Mangalasasanam Day.</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>As the Srikaryams of the Temple, they represent Sri Viswaksena. The religious heads and other V. I. Ps are received by them who come to the Temple, with &ldquo;Poornakumbham&rdquo; and reciation of appropriate Vedas or Stotras.
66
On the Tirukkalyanam&rdquo; (Wedding) festival occasions, they do the &ldquo;Samarppanai
Samarppanai&rdquo; service on behalf of Sri Periyalwar (father of Sri Andal) by offering the silver plates containing silk and lace sarees
193
and vastras with fruits and flowers at the Feet of the Lord and His consorts after chanting the Vedas and pronouncing the words &ldquo;Perialwar Samarppanai&rdquo;.
5. The Tiruvalavattam service (fanning) is rendered by them, at the end of the Mantrapushpam service representing thereby Sri Tirukkachi Nambigal who was doing this regularly to our Lord very ardently, during his lifetime.
6.
Sri Bashyakar (Sri Ramanuja) used to bring Tirtam (holy water) for the Tirumanjanam (holy bath) and pooja for our Lord, daily. This kainkaryam or service is even now the precious privilege of the Tatacharyas, as also the Chanting of the &lsquo;Sri Bhashya&rsquo; of Sri Ramanuja during the course of Mantrapushpam and Veda Sattumurai occasions. On the ceremonial &ldquo;Alankara Tirumanjanam&rdquo; occasions (holy bath to the Lord, His Consorts and other Deities), they recite Stotrams in Their praise. This is called &ldquo;Tirumanjana Kattiyam &quot;
composed in the Manipravala style (Sanskrit and Tamil)
7. As the Mirasdars of the Stotrapatam service they recite the Stotrams of the Acharyas on their behalf on all relevant occasions.
8.
All the religious functions in the Temple, like the Dwajarohanam, Ankurarpanam, Mritu Sangrahanam etc., are started by them with the recital of Vedas.
9. The Tirukkartigai festival is started through them by their carrying the.&rdquo; Deepams&rdquo; (Mud lamps) from Sri Desika&rsquo;s shrine to the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Lord on the Hill with the chanting of Vedas, ringing of the bell and other paraphernalia.
10.
The &ldquo;Kaisika
Puranam &quot; and the &ldquo;Hastigiri Mahatmiyam&rdquo; are read by them on the Kaisika Dwadasi day and the Pallavotsavam days respectively, for which special honours and emoluments are attached.
11.
194
It is a proud privilege of these people to perform the &ldquo;Thirumeni kaval&rdquo; (Body-Guards) service to the Lord and His Consorts.
They also accompany the &ldquo;Garlands&rdquo;. which are taken ceremoniously on the Tirukkalyanam festivals between the Lord and His Consortss for exchange, and on occasions when the &ldquo;Sri Satari&rdquo; is taken to the Bakta V.grahas.
In fine, they are the recognised Chief Mirasdars and service holders in the Temple where none else can claim such a superior and unique position which, decides in turn the Vadakalai character of the institution unequivocally.
