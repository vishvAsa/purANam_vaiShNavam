  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-V PUJAS AND FESTIVALS &#34; In this Chapter under Section 1-&#34; Puja or worship Dr. K.V. Raman describes the procedure with regard to the ceremonial worship, again in his own way and as a true Tenkalai. The description in the first para of the ‘puja’ is exactly a verbatim reproduction of the Adyapaka’ case, reported in the 15 Madras weekly Notes, of our Temple. His fixation of time for Mantra pushpa service and the details about Stotrapata and Sevakalam all smack of the Tenkalai claims and allegations in the concerned litigations. Even then he errs in saying that Mantrapushpa is performed in the fifth asana whereas admittedly it is in the third asana or Alankarasana ‘. • Whatever it is, the fact that Dr. K. V. Raman has been openly canvassing for the cause of his sect in each and every part of this treatise’, in season and out of season, with or without context, has become plain by now. The author is not correct while making the statement that the Pancharatra literature was considered superior to the Vedas. A careful study of Pancharatra works reveals that the system is not held to be superior to the Vedas, nor anti-vedic as held by some scholars. In fact, many vedic mantras are bodily reproduced and recommended in the manuals, for use in the rituals! Again, the rituals in this Temple have been primarily governed by the Jayakhya Samhita adopting the Padma Samhita now and then for clarification. Some of the Archakas in the Temple have been following Padmasamhita. It is also not correct to say that portions of the Prabandas are recited during the entire duration of Puja, for it is only on specified inner periods of the Puja, the Prábandas are recited. 44 Another factual error is his recital on page 97 about the ‘Holy Bath&#34;. He says that it is done to Utsava-bera on the 7 • 90 day following New Moon and Full Moon days. This is not correct. It is done on Ekadasi days apart from the other days mentioned by him. These are called Panchaparva Utsavas in the Temple parlance. He next deals with the Divyaprabanda recital on pages 98 and 99. His admiration and praise for the recitation of the Prabandas need not be disputed.. Only thing is, he could have mentioned about the recitation of Vedas also, which is very special and important in this Temple. The vast concourse of Vedic reciters who are Vadakalais gather here voluntarily. The Vedic-goshti follows the Deity, during the grand Brahmotsava throughout the entire length and breadth of the procession the longest of its kind in the whole of India, both in the morning and evening, without any remuneration, out of devotion. In all the ordinary and other important festivals as well as festivals celebrated in places like Seevaram and Aiyangarkulam outside the town, they accompany the Deity throughout, day and night and end only when the Deity returns to the Temple without break. Pavitrotsava and Adyayana Utsava are two other very important festivals where this Vedic congregation attracts the devotees both by its numbers and the melody of the recitation. Despite his unwillingness to mention this sacred and important Vedic recital along with the Divyaprabanda recital on pages 98 and 99, the author has to concede this on page 105 while describing the “Pavitrotsava &#34; festival. In doing so, he commits certain flagrant mistakes. He refers to an epigraph which is said to attest to the celebration of this festival” even as early as 1521 A. D.&#34; For this he cites inscription No. 346 of S.I.T.I.I under foot Note No. 39 on page 109. But this inscription does not mention anything about this festival. It is with regard to certain details of offering by the ‘Jiyar’ of Ahobila Math, Secondly, he has wrongly stated that “the performance of this festival is referred to in a record of Achyutaraya dated 1533.” He cites the inscription No. 406 of S. I. T. 1. I under Foot Note No. 40. But it is 405 and the king mentioned therein is Sadasivaraya. The date of the record is also 1552 and not 1533, It is really amazing to see how such gross misleading errors have been allowed to occur in a Treatise’ submitted and approved of for the award of Ph.D. 91 There is a graphic description in Tamil of this grand Vedaparayana goshti by a modern editor Sri A. K. Chettiar. He refers to the heat of the sun, strain of accompanying the Deity for the full length of the procession and their large number. He puts the number between 100 and 300 for the entire festival days. He admires their unlimited devotion and sincerity for rendering this service for which there is neither remuneration or any income nor any ‘prasadam’ from the Temple. This is certainly Kainkarya par excellence, as it is done without expecting any reward in return and is carried out only to please God.2 Many of us still remember the number of such persons at about thousand in the thirties. Those who had the pleasure of simply accompanying the goshti still remember how even after the passing of the Deity in the procession people from streets adjoining the main street of the procession stay on and wait till the goshti passes through, bow to it and return home. This practice is observed even today,3 If Dr. K. V. Raman had been impartial he could not have afforded to omit to mention this most important service and feature of our Temple, alongside of the recital of Prabandas which is not continuous but partial in processions of the Deity. But the sectarian instinct in him got the better of him. It cannot be helped. It is true, that in our Temple both the goshtis are sincere and very enthusiastic in coming foward in their numbers for rendering the services. This is a special feature of our Temple which has got to be appreciated certainly and which cannot be found anywhere else. Sri A. K. Chettiar has poetically represented the goshtis of the two kinds as the ministrels going in the front singing the titles and achievements of the King in procession and the Vedic Scholars invoking the blessings of God (Swasthivachana) for the welfare of the king by following Him.* FESTIVALS The festivals in the year starting from the Tamil month of Chittirai are described with the utmost care and precision one 92 by one.. The Tenkalai Acharya Manavalamamuni’s festival in Aipasi is glorified extensively. But what is noteworthy here is the glaring omission of. the Kartikai Anusham festival of Sri Tatadesika. This festival is celebrated for ten days and on the tenth day, the Tirunakshatram day of Sri Tatadesika, Sriperundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja are taken, to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika in the morning, adorned with all the precious jewels after a grand procession around the Alwar prakara with the big umbrellas and all other paraphernalia of the Temple. There are Satari honours during the starting of the procession to Sri Vedantadesika (Mulavar and Utsavar), Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then after the procession round the Alwar prakara, the Deities are alighted in the shrine after the “Darsana Tambulam” (reception ceremony) and a second time honours of garland and Satari to Sri Tatadesika. This time Sri Satari honours are shown first to Sri Desika’s Mulavar and Utsavȧr and garland and Satari honours are then shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort Sri Ammangar. These honours will be taken with the gold and silver umbrellas, samarams, torches and “kattiyam kattiyam” recitals. In the mid-day there is an elaborate ceremonial Holy bath or Alankara Tirumanjana to Sri Perundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja when again the Tulasi and rose garlands of the Deities and Satari honours are shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort with Sri Satari first to Sri Desika. In the afternoon. there is the grand Astanam to the Deities when the puja, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruppavai Sattumurai takes place. The Lord and Sri Perundevi will be adorned with many other precious jewels and lace cloths (vastras). Offerings of several kinds of delicacies will be made at this time. This worship will last for two to three hours. After the Nivedana, once again the garland and Satari honours will be repeated as described above. Then the Deities will be adorned with fresh flowers and big garlands. At about seven in the evening there will be a still more grand procession to the Lord upto the Tiruvadi Koil (Hanuman Temple) at the end of the Sannidi Street with great pomp and splendour. On return the Lord will wait at the Gopuravasal till Sri Tayar who had remained at the The Divyadampatis on the Sattumurai Day of Sri Tatadesika at the Latter’s Shrine (P. 92) Mangalasasanam of Sri Tuppul Desika in the Mirror Room (P. 85) Sri Tatadesika Blessed by the Divine Couple with Parivattam, Garlands and Thagadi, on His Birthday (P. 93) :93 • shrine; joins Him and then Both are taken in procession once ́again round the Alwar prakara. Before alighting at the shrine there will be the usual Veda Sattumurai and Satari honours to Sri Desika, Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then the final Tiruvaradana, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruvaymozhi Sattumurai and Nivedana, will take place and this time apart from the garlands and Sri Satari, Lace Duppatta (Thagadi) and parivattam honours will be shown to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar preceded by. Satari to Sri Desikar, After the distribution of Tirta and Prasadas, the Lord and Sri Perundevi will leave the shrine, in the early hours of the next morning after bestowing the final honours. The Malai-matral (the exchange of garlands between Sri Tayar and Sri Perumal) is another unique feature during the course of this festival. There will be the ceremony of “Padiyetram” when they get down the steps of the shrine, with the burning of camphor and “Kattiyam” (stotras in praise of the Lord) for four or five times. The unique and spectacular Darsana (Sight) of the Divine Couple without garland and ‘prabai’ at this juncture will be thrilling and soul stirring. It will be a futile exercise to attempt to describe this exquisite spectacle by words or writing. One has to enjoy and worship this occasion only personally in order to realise the uniqueness in its fullness. We have been compelled to narrate this Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika in such a great detail to show how this very important and big festival has been completely omitted and ignored wantonly by Dr. K. V. Raman in this chapter, whereas he describes in minute detail all other festivals of the year and especially that of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni. One more point that has got to be mentioned about the Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika is that both Sri Perundevi and Lord Varadaraja are taken to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika on his Sattumurai day whether the day is Friday or any other day of the week, whereas for the Sattumurai festivals of all the other Alwars and Acharyas both will be taken only if the Sattumurai festival falls on a Friday. This is because of the fact that Sri Tatadesika is the Lakshmikumara’ and Sri Tayar has to be necessarily taken to Her son’s shrine along with the Lord on his birth day. 6 *94 Further, the Lord or Both, (if it is a Friday) will be taken to the shrine of the Alwars or Acharyas only in the evening of their Sattumurai day, unlike Sri Tatadesika’s Sattumurai, when They are taken in the morning itself followed by an elaborate ceremony of two processions Alankara Tirumanjanam, two Astanams etc., for a full day. The Thagadi Bahumanam (honour) mentioned above is done exclusively to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Tuppul Desika alone, on their Annual Tirunakshatram days. Apart from the non-mention of this grand festival, the author did not choose to mention the Ganda ppodi Vasanta Utsava on the day following the Panguni Uttiram festival, which is used to be attended by a vast gathering. Likewise, the author should not have missed referring to the festival as described in Hamsasandesas. The beautiful fast moving procession of the Lord to the car festival and the Irattaippurappadu festivals with the Goddess Perundevi on Panchaparva days when they happen to be Fridays could have also been mentioned. At least three erroneous statements are found made on Page 103. The Deity is not given a bath in a tub on the eighth day of Brahmotsava, but only the Holy Feet of the Lord and His Consorts are dipped in the sacred saffron water kept in a big silver tub. On the tenth day night, the procession is through the streets around the Temple. Vedanta Desika did not specially&#34; mention Garudotsava, for other vehicles also get mentioned along with Garuda.&#34;. In a work exclusively devoted to the treatment of this Temple and a Chapter which is devoted to the treatment of festivals it is quite essential to describe why the festivals are grand in the Temple. In all processions, from the elephant and horse in the front and Vedaparayanam in the rear, everything in this Temple is grand and unique. Mention must be made of a peculiar instrument of music accompaniment called ‘Surya Vadya’ played upon in the vicinity of God. The sound of Tirucchinnam, which is only one in this Temple, has a sweetness, the like of which is not available anywhere else. It is observed that this sound is not to be had for any Deity in any Temple’. While every part in the procession contributes to the overall attractiveness, it is the Deity that is the centre of· 95 enchantment. The person of the Lord is by Itself captivating in Its unadorned state. Embellishments do enhance this artless charm. A carefully made selection of the ornaments with the aim of maintaining a happy blending of their role with the natural beauty of the Lord is attempted on every occasion and Brahmotsava, in particular. The skill of the Archakas in the decoration of the Lord has also got to be appreciated here. The Lord appears new and new and more and more attractive on every occasion. The garlands are sparingly used to the extent the Conch and Discus could contain. The only other Temple where this is practised is the one at Srirangam. Such is the enthralling impression created in the devotees which makes them remain with the Lord as long as they can. Evidently Dr. K. V. Raman had no occasion to observe these specific features of the festivals in this Temple. This chapter has thus lost its importance without the depiction of these festivals and features.

The Vedic-goshti follows the Deity, during the grand Brahmotsava throughout the entire length and breadth of the procession the longest of its kind in the whole of India, both in the morning and evening, without any remuneration, out of devotion. In all the ordinary and other important festivals as well as festivals celebrated in places like Seevaram and Aiyangarkulam outside the town, they accompany the Deity throughout, day and night and end only when the Deity returns to the Temple without break. Pavitrotsava and Adyayana Utsava are two other very important festivals where this Vedic congregation attracts the devotees both by its numbers and the melody of the recitation. Despite his unwillingness to mention this sacred and important Vedic recital along with the Divyaprabanda recital on pages 98 and 99, the author has to concede this on page 105 while describing the “Pavitrotsava &#34; festival. In doing so, he commits certain flagrant mistakes. He refers to an epigraph which is said to attest to the celebration of this festival” even as early as 1521 A. D.&#34; For this he cites inscription No. 346 of S.I.T.I.I under foot Note No. 39 on page 109. But this inscription does not mention anything about this festival. It is with regard to certain details of offering by the ‘Jiyar’ of Ahobila Math, Secondly, he has wrongly stated that “the performance of this festival is referred to in a record of Achyutaraya dated 1533.” He cites the inscription No. 406 of S. I. T. 1. I under Foot Note No. 40. But it is 405 and the king mentioned therein is Sadasivaraya. The date of the record is also 1552 and not 1533, It is really amazing to see how such gross misleading errors have been allowed to occur in a Treatise’ submitted and approved of for the award of Ph.D. 91 There is a graphic description in Tamil of this grand Vedaparayana goshti by a modern editor Sri A. K. Chettiar. He refers to the heat of the sun, strain of accompanying the Deity for the full length of the procession and their large number. He puts the number between 100 and 300 for the entire festival days. He admires their unlimited devotion and sincerity for rendering this service for which there is neither remuneration or any income nor any ‘prasadam’ from the Temple. This is certainly Kainkarya par excellence, as it is done without expecting any reward in return and is carried out only to please God.2 Many of us still remember the number of such persons at about thousand in the thirties. Those who had the pleasure of simply accompanying the goshti still remember how even after the passing of the Deity in the procession people from streets adjoining the main street of the procession stay on and wait till the goshti passes through, bow to it and return home. This practice is observed even today,3 If Dr. K. V. Raman had been impartial he could not have afforded to omit to mention this most important service and feature of our Temple, alongside of the recital of Prabandas which is not continuous but partial in processions of the Deity. But the sectarian instinct in him got the better of him. It cannot be helped. It is true, that in our Temple both the goshtis are sincere and very enthusiastic in coming foward in their numbers for rendering the services. This is a special feature of our Temple which has got to be appreciated certainly and which cannot be found anywhere else. Sri A. K. Chettiar has poetically represented the goshtis of the two kinds as the ministrels going in the front singing the titles and achievements of the King in procession and the Vedic Scholars invoking the blessings of God (Swasthivachana) for the welfare of the king by following Him.* FESTIVALS The festivals in the year starting from the Tamil month of Chittirai are described with the utmost care and precision one 92 by one.. The Tenkalai Acharya Manavalamamuni’s festival in Aipasi is glorified extensively. But what is noteworthy here is the glaring omission of. the Kartikai Anusham festival of Sri Tatadesika. This festival is celebrated for ten days and on the tenth day, the Tirunakshatram day of Sri Tatadesika, Sriperundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja are taken, to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika in the morning, adorned with all the precious jewels after a grand procession around the Alwar prakara with the big umbrellas and all other paraphernalia of the Temple. There are Satari honours during the starting of the procession to Sri Vedantadesika (Mulavar and Utsavar), Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then after the procession round the Alwar prakara, the Deities are alighted in the shrine after the “Darsana Tambulam” (reception ceremony) and a second time honours of garland and Satari to Sri Tatadesika. This time Sri Satari honours are shown first to Sri Desika’s Mulavar and Utsavȧr and garland and Satari honours are then shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort Sri Ammangar. These honours will be taken with the gold and silver umbrellas, samarams, torches and “kattiyam kattiyam” recitals. In the mid-day there is an elaborate ceremonial Holy bath or Alankara Tirumanjana to Sri Perundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja when again the Tulasi and rose garlands of the Deities and Satari honours are shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort with Sri Satari first to Sri Desika. In the afternoon. there is the grand Astanam to the Deities when the puja, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruppavai Sattumurai takes place. The Lord and Sri Perundevi will be adorned with many other precious jewels and lace cloths (vastras). Offerings of several kinds of delicacies will be made at this time. This worship will last for two to three hours. After the Nivedana, once again the garland and Satari honours will be repeated as described above. Then the Deities will be adorned with fresh flowers and big garlands. At about seven in the evening there will be a still more grand procession to the Lord upto the Tiruvadi Koil (Hanuman Temple) at the end of the Sannidi Street with great pomp and splendour. On return the Lord will wait at the Gopuravasal till Sri Tayar who had remained at the The Divyadampatis on the Sattumurai Day of Sri Tatadesika at the Latter’s Shrine (P. 92) Mangalasasanam of Sri Tuppul Desika in the Mirror Room (P. 85) Sri Tatadesika Blessed by the Divine Couple with Parivattam, Garlands and Thagadi, on His Birthday (P. 93) :93 • shrine; joins Him and then Both are taken in procession once ́again round the Alwar prakara. Before alighting at the shrine there will be the usual Veda Sattumurai and Satari honours to Sri Desika, Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then the final Tiruvaradana, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruvaymozhi Sattumurai and Nivedana, will take place and this time apart from the garlands and Sri Satari, Lace Duppatta (Thagadi) and parivattam honours will be shown to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar preceded by. Satari to Sri Desikar, After the distribution of Tirta and Prasadas, the Lord and Sri Perundevi will leave the shrine, in the early hours of the next morning after bestowing the final honours. The Malai-matral (the exchange of garlands between Sri Tayar and Sri Perumal) is another unique feature during the course of this festival. There will be the ceremony of “Padiyetram” when they get down the steps of the shrine, with the burning of camphor and “Kattiyam” (stotras in praise of the Lord) for four or five times. The unique and spectacular Darsana (Sight) of the Divine Couple without garland and ‘prabai’ at this juncture will be thrilling and soul stirring. It will be a futile exercise to attempt to describe this exquisite spectacle by words or writing. One has to enjoy and worship this occasion only personally in order to realise the uniqueness in its fullness. We have been compelled to narrate this Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika in such a great detail to show how this very important and big festival has been completely omitted and ignored wantonly by Dr. K. V. Raman in this chapter, whereas he describes in minute detail all other festivals of the year and especially that of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni. One more point that has got to be mentioned about the Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika is that both Sri Perundevi and Lord Varadaraja are taken to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika on his Sattumurai day whether the day is Friday or any other day of the week, whereas for the Sattumurai festivals of all the other Alwars and Acharyas both will be taken only if the Sattumurai festival falls on a Friday. This is because of the fact that Sri Tatadesika is the Lakshmikumara’ and Sri Tayar has to be necessarily taken to Her son’s shrine along with the Lord on his birth day. 6 *94 Further, the Lord or Both, (if it is a Friday) will be taken to the shrine of the Alwars or Acharyas only in the evening of their Sattumurai day, unlike Sri Tatadesika’s Sattumurai, when They are taken in the morning itself followed by an elaborate ceremony of two processions Alankara Tirumanjanam, two Astanams etc., for a full day. The Thagadi Bahumanam (honour) mentioned above is done exclusively to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Tuppul Desika alone, on their Annual Tirunakshatram days. Apart from the non-mention of this grand festival, the author did not choose to mention the Ganda ppodi Vasanta Utsava on the day following the Panguni Uttiram festival, which is used to be attended by a vast gathering. Likewise, the author should not have missed referring to the festival as described in Hamsasandesas. The beautiful fast moving procession of the Lord to the car festival and the Irattaippurappadu festivals with the Goddess Perundevi on Panchaparva days when they happen to be Fridays could have also been mentioned. At least three erroneous statements are found made on Page 103. The Deity is not given a bath in a tub on the eighth day of Brahmotsava, but only the Holy Feet of the Lord and His Consorts are dipped in the sacred saffron water kept in a big silver tub. On the tenth day night, the procession is through the streets around the Temple. Vedanta Desika did not specially&#34; mention Garudotsava, for other vehicles also get mentioned along with Garuda.&#34;. In a work exclusively devoted to the treatment of this Temple and a Chapter which is devoted to the treatment of festivals it is quite essential to describe why the festivals are grand in the Temple. In all processions, from the elephant and horse in the front and Vedaparayanam in the rear, everything in this Temple is grand and unique. Mention must be made of a peculiar instrument of music accompaniment called ‘Surya Vadya’ played upon in the vicinity of God. The sound of Tirucchinnam, which is only one in this Temple, has a sweetness, the like of which is not available anywhere else. It is observed that this sound is not to be had for any Deity in any Temple’. While every part in the procession contributes to the overall attractiveness, it is the Deity that is the centre of· 95 enchantment. The person of the Lord is by Itself captivating in Its unadorned state. Embellishments do enhance this artless charm. A carefully made selection of the ornaments with the aim of maintaining a happy blending of their role with the natural beauty of the Lord is attempted on every occasion and Brahmotsava, in particular. The skill of the Archakas in the decoration of the Lord has also got to be appreciated here. The Lord appears new and new and more and more attractive on every occasion. The garlands are sparingly used to the extent the Conch and Discus could contain. The only other Temple where this is practised is the one at Srirangam. Such is the enthralling impression created in the devotees which makes them remain with the Lord as long as they can. Evidently Dr. K. V. Raman had no occasion to observe these specific features of the festivals in this Temple. This chapter has thus lost its importance without the depiction of these festivals and features.

  <p>CHAPTER-V
PUJAS AND FESTIVALS
&quot;
In this Chapter under Section 1-&quot; Puja or worship Dr. K.V. Raman describes the procedure with regard to the ceremonial worship, again in his own way and as a true Tenkalai. The description in the first para of the &lsquo;puja&rsquo; is exactly a verbatim reproduction of the Adyapaka&rsquo; case, reported in the 15 Madras weekly Notes, of our Temple. His fixation of time for Mantra pushpa service and the details about Stotrapata and Sevakalam all smack of the Tenkalai claims and allegations in the concerned litigations. Even then he errs in saying that Mantrapushpa is performed in the fifth asana whereas admittedly it is in the third asana or Alankarasana &lsquo;.
•
Whatever it is, the fact that Dr. K. V. Raman has been openly canvassing for the cause of his sect in each and every part of this treatise&rsquo;, in season and out of season, with or without context, has become plain by
now.
The author is not correct while making the statement that the Pancharatra literature was considered superior to the Vedas. A careful study of Pancharatra works reveals that the system is not held to be superior to the Vedas, nor anti-vedic as held by some scholars. In fact, many vedic mantras are bodily reproduced and recommended in the manuals, for use in the rituals! Again, the rituals in this Temple have been primarily governed by the Jayakhya Samhita adopting the Padma Samhita now and then for clarification. Some of the Archakas in the Temple have been following Padmasamhita.
It is also not correct to say that portions of the Prabandas are recited during the entire duration of Puja, for it is only on specified inner periods of the Puja, the Prábandas are recited.
44
Another factual error is his recital on page 97 about the &lsquo;Holy Bath&quot;. He says that it is done to Utsava-bera on the

day following New Moon and Full Moon days. This is not correct. It is done on Ekadasi days apart from the other days mentioned by him. These are called Panchaparva Utsavas in the Temple parlance. He next deals with the Divyaprabanda recital on pages 98 and 99. His admiration and praise for the recitation of the Prabandas need not be disputed.. Only thing is, he could have mentioned about the recitation of Vedas also, which is very special and important in this Temple. The vast concourse of Vedic reciters who are Vadakalais gather here voluntarily. The Vedic-goshti follows the Deity, during the grand Brahmotsava throughout the entire length and breadth of the procession the longest of its kind in the whole of India, both in the morning and evening, without any remuneration, out of devotion. In all the ordinary and other important festivals as well as festivals celebrated in places like Seevaram and Aiyangarkulam outside the town, they accompany the Deity throughout, day and night and end only when the Deity returns to the Temple without break.
Pavitrotsava and Adyayana Utsava are two other very important festivals where this Vedic congregation attracts the devotees both by its numbers and the melody of the recitation. Despite his unwillingness to mention this sacred and important Vedic recital along with the Divyaprabanda recital on pages 98 and 99, the author has to concede this on page 105 while describing the &ldquo;Pavitrotsava &quot; festival. In doing so, he commits certain flagrant mistakes. He refers to an epigraph which is said to attest to the celebration of this festival&rdquo; even as early as 1521 A. D.&quot; For this he cites inscription No. 346 of S.I.T.I.I under foot Note No. 39 on page 109. But this inscription does not mention anything about this festival. It is with regard to certain details of offering by the &lsquo;Jiyar&rsquo; of Ahobila Math, Secondly, he has wrongly stated that &ldquo;the performance of this festival is referred to in a record of Achyutaraya dated 1533.&rdquo; He cites the inscription No. 406 of S. I. T. 1. I under Foot Note No. 40. But it is 405 and the king mentioned therein is Sadasivaraya. The date of the record is also 1552 and not 1533, It is really amazing to see how such gross misleading errors have been allowed to occur in a Treatise&rsquo; submitted and approved of for the award of Ph.D.

There is a graphic description in Tamil of this grand Vedaparayana goshti by a modern editor Sri A. K. Chettiar. He refers to the heat of the sun, strain of accompanying the Deity for the full length of the procession and their large number. He puts the number between 100 and 300 for the entire festival days. He admires their unlimited devotion and sincerity for rendering this service for which there is neither remuneration or any income nor any &lsquo;prasadam&rsquo; from the Temple. This is certainly Kainkarya par excellence, as it is done without expecting any reward in return and is carried out only to please God.2
Many of us still remember the number of such persons at about thousand in the thirties. Those who had the pleasure of simply accompanying the goshti still remember how even after the passing of the Deity in the procession people from streets adjoining the main street of the procession stay on and wait till the goshti passes through, bow to it and return home. This practice is observed even today,3
If Dr. K. V. Raman had been impartial he could not have afforded to omit to mention this most important service and feature of our Temple, alongside of the recital of Prabandas which is not continuous but partial in processions of the Deity. But the sectarian instinct in him got the better of him. It cannot be helped. It is true, that in our Temple both the goshtis are sincere and very enthusiastic in coming foward in their numbers for rendering the services. This is a special feature of our Temple which has got to be appreciated certainly and which cannot be found anywhere else.
Sri A. K. Chettiar has poetically represented the goshtis of the two kinds as the ministrels going in the front singing the titles and achievements of the King in procession and the Vedic Scholars invoking the blessings of God (Swasthivachana) for the welfare of the king by following Him.*
FESTIVALS
The festivals in the year starting from the Tamil month of Chittirai are described with the utmost care and precision one

by one.. The Tenkalai Acharya Manavalamamuni&rsquo;s festival in Aipasi is glorified extensively. But what is noteworthy here is the glaring omission of. the Kartikai Anusham festival of Sri Tatadesika. This festival is celebrated for ten days and on the tenth day, the Tirunakshatram day of Sri Tatadesika, Sriperundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja are taken, to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika in the morning, adorned with all the precious jewels after a grand procession around the Alwar prakara with the big umbrellas and all other paraphernalia of the Temple. There are Satari honours during the starting of the procession to Sri Vedantadesika (Mulavar and Utsavar), Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then after the procession round the Alwar prakara, the Deities are alighted in the shrine after the &ldquo;Darsana Tambulam&rdquo; (reception ceremony) and a second time honours of garland and Satari to Sri Tatadesika. This time Sri Satari honours are shown first to Sri Desika&rsquo;s Mulavar and Utsavȧr and garland and Satari honours are then shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort Sri Ammangar. These honours will be taken with the gold and silver umbrellas, samarams, torches and &ldquo;kattiyam
kattiyam&rdquo; recitals.
In the mid-day there is an elaborate ceremonial Holy bath or Alankara Tirumanjana to Sri Perundevi Tayar and Lord Varadaraja when again the Tulasi and rose garlands of the Deities and Satari honours are shown to Sri Tatadesika and his consort with Sri Satari first to Sri Desika. In the afternoon. there is the grand Astanam to the Deities when the puja, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruppavai Sattumurai takes place. The Lord and Sri Perundevi will be adorned with many other precious jewels and lace cloths (vastras). Offerings of several kinds of delicacies will be made at this time. This worship will last for two to three hours. After the Nivedana, once again the garland and Satari honours will be repeated as described above. Then the Deities will be adorned with fresh flowers and big garlands. At about seven in the evening there will be a still more grand procession to the Lord upto the Tiruvadi Koil (Hanuman Temple) at the end of the Sannidi Street with great pomp and splendour. On return the Lord will wait at the Gopuravasal till Sri Tayar who had remained at the

shrine; joins Him and then Both are taken in procession once  ́again round the Alwar prakara. Before alighting at the shrine there will be the usual Veda Sattumurai and Satari honours to Sri Desika, Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar. Then the final Tiruvaradana, with Mantrapushpa and Tiruvaymozhi Sattumurai and Nivedana, will take place and this time apart from the garlands and Sri Satari, Lace Duppatta (Thagadi) and parivattam honours will be shown to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Ammangar preceded by. Satari to Sri Desikar, After the distribution of Tirta and Prasadas, the Lord and Sri Perundevi will leave the shrine, in the early hours of the next morning after bestowing the final honours. The Malai-matral (the exchange of garlands between Sri Tayar and Sri Perumal) is another unique feature during the course of this festival. There will be the ceremony of &ldquo;Padiyetram&rdquo; when they get down the steps of the shrine, with the burning of camphor and &ldquo;Kattiyam&rdquo; (stotras in praise of the Lord) for four or five times. The unique and spectacular Darsana (Sight) of the Divine Couple without garland and &lsquo;prabai&rsquo; at this juncture will be thrilling and soul stirring. It will be a futile exercise to attempt to describe this exquisite spectacle by words or writing. One has to enjoy and worship this occasion only personally in order to realise the uniqueness in its fullness. We have been compelled to narrate this Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika in such a great detail to show how this very important and big festival has been completely omitted and ignored wantonly by Dr. K. V. Raman in this chapter, whereas he describes in minute detail all other festivals of the year and especially that of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni.
One more point that has got to be mentioned about the Sattumurai festival of Sri Tatadesika is that both Sri Perundevi and Lord Varadaraja are taken to the shrine of Sri Tatadesika on his Sattumurai day whether the day is Friday or any other day of the week, whereas for the Sattumurai festivals of all the other Alwars and Acharyas both will be taken only if the Sattumurai festival falls on a Friday. This is because of the fact that Sri Tatadesika is the Lakshmikumara&rsquo; and Sri Tayar has to be necessarily taken to Her son&rsquo;s shrine along with the Lord on his birth day.

Further, the Lord or Both, (if it is a Friday) will be taken to the shrine of the Alwars or Acharyas only in the evening of their Sattumurai day, unlike Sri Tatadesika&rsquo;s Sattumurai, when They are taken in the morning itself followed by an elaborate ceremony of two processions Alankara Tirumanjanam, two Astanams etc., for a full day. The Thagadi Bahumanam (honour) mentioned above is done exclusively to Sri Tatadesika and Sri Tuppul Desika alone, on their Annual Tirunakshatram days.
Apart from the non-mention of this grand festival, the author did not choose to mention the Ganda ppodi Vasanta Utsava on the day following the Panguni Uttiram festival, which is used to be attended by a vast gathering. Likewise, the author should not have missed referring to the festival as described in Hamsasandesas. The beautiful fast moving procession of the Lord to the car festival and the Irattaippurappadu festivals with the Goddess Perundevi on Panchaparva days when they happen to be Fridays could have also been mentioned.
At least three erroneous statements are found made on Page 103. The Deity is not given a bath in a tub on the eighth day of Brahmotsava, but only the Holy Feet of the Lord and His Consorts are dipped in the sacred saffron water kept in a big silver tub. On the tenth day night, the procession is through the streets around the Temple. Vedanta Desika did not specially&quot; mention Garudotsava, for other vehicles also get mentioned along with Garuda.&quot;.
In a work exclusively devoted to the treatment of this Temple and a Chapter which is devoted to the treatment of festivals it is quite essential to describe why the festivals are grand in the Temple. In all processions, from the elephant and horse in the front and Vedaparayanam in the rear, everything in this Temple is grand and unique. Mention must be made of a peculiar instrument of music accompaniment called &lsquo;Surya Vadya&rsquo; played upon in the vicinity of God. The sound of Tirucchinnam, which is only one in this Temple, has a sweetness, the like of which is not available anywhere else. It is observed that this sound is not to be had for any Deity in any Temple&rsquo;.
While every part in the procession contributes to the overall attractiveness, it is the Deity that is the centre of·
95
enchantment. The person of the Lord is by Itself captivating in Its unadorned state. Embellishments do enhance this artless charm. A carefully made selection of the ornaments with the aim of maintaining a happy blending of their role with the natural beauty of the Lord is attempted on every occasion and Brahmotsava, in particular. The skill of the Archakas in the decoration of the Lord has also got to be appreciated here. The Lord appears new and new and more and more attractive on every occasion. The garlands are sparingly used to the extent the Conch and Discus could contain. The only other Temple where this is practised is the one at Srirangam. Such is the enthralling impression created in the devotees which makes them remain with the Lord as long as they can.
Evidently Dr. K. V. Raman had no occasion to observe these specific features of the festivals in this Temple. This chapter has thus lost its importance without the depiction of these festivals and features.
