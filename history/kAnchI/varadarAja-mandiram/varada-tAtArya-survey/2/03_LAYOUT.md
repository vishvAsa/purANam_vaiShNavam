CHAPTER-III 
THE LAYOUT OF THE TEMPLE AND SEQUENCE OF CONSTRUCTION 
In this chapter, the author, gives out at the outset that the purpose of this chapter is to decribe the general layout of the Vardarajaswami Temple and the disposition of the various shrines, mantapas and other structures therein. It is true he has described these items very minutely. But we can at the same time discern here an under-current of sectarian bias. Adnau- seam, he brings out the name of one Alagia Manavala Jiyar as the architect of the important constructions and structures of the Temple like the big rampart wall- Periyatirumadil, Gopura, Kalyana mantapa, the front porch of the Abhisheka Mantapa and the Ornamental Mantapa where both Lord Varada and Sri Perundevi are seated together on the same dias on the Maha- Navami Day. He concedes also that these were done in the 16th century by the patronage of the Vijayanagar Kings. These Vijayanagar Kings were the acknowledged disciples of the Tata- charyas. There is nothing on record to show that Alagiya Manavala Jiyar was the Guru of the Vijayanagar Kings nor the author himself claims such a position to this Jiyar. Whileso, we are unable to see the logic in asserting that this Jiyar did all these Kainkaryams in the sixteenth century. There is no inscriptional or historical basis for such an assertion. 
In this context it is also relevant to note that while the words "Srimad Vedamarga" etc. occur before the name Ettur Tirumala Kumara Tatacharya in the inscriptions, these prefixes or "Birudus" and also "Paramahamsa Parivrajakacharya" are not used for Alagia Manavala Jiyar. He is simply mentioned as "Srikaryam Seyvar Alagia Manavala Jiyar". If he has to be placed on a par with the Tatacharya, these prefixes would have certainly found a place in the inscriptions before his name. The pontiffs of the Ahobila Math are all mentioned with such prefixes, in the inscriptions, that are due to the ascetic order. This sig- nificant absence of the "birudus" to the Alagia Manavala Jiyar in the inscriptions do certainly indicate the difference in their 
54 
status and that he was only doing the Srikaryam service under the overall control of the Tatacharya who was the Manager- General (Srikarya-durandara) of Temple Affairs. (see also Chapter VI) 
Another interesting point that is noteworthy here is that one Jana Mudaliar is also described as 'Srikainkarya Durandara' in the inscriptions (Saka 1493-1571 A.D). By this, it can be seen that this title "Srikaryam Seyvar" alone cannot be made much of, unless augmented with other stronger factors of proof for establishing the position of a superior authority in the Temple' 
On the other hand, it has been recognised by history and inscriptions found not only in the temples of Kanchi but also other places like Tirupati, that Sri Tatacharya and his venerable father, Panchamata-banjanam Tatacharya, his ancestors and their descendants were the Raja-gurus and responsible for the several constructions mentioned above, as well as so many other items like Bali-pitam, Vahanas, Jewels, Kavachas and Vimanas, through the bounteousness of their royal disciples the Vijayana- gar Kings Krishnadevaraya, Achyutaraya, Ramaraya, Sri Ranga, Venkatapatideva I, etc. The slokas which deal with some of the said Kainkaryas are inscribed in the Temple in stone, in several places2. 
Another inscription deals with his services at Tirupati (Panipatigiri)3. Yet another one describes his kainkaryas not only at Kanchi but also in several other places like Srirangam, Kumbakonam, and Tirupati in his capacity as the most respected royal preceptor of the Karnataka Monarch3. 
We shall have occasion to deal with this aspect in detail in the succeeding chapter. For the present, it is sufficient to point out that the author's assertion in this chapter in-season and out of season that Alagia Manavala Jiyar, a Tenkalai Sanyasin, did, all these services has absolutely no basis. As pointed out earlier he might have acted on certain occasions as the "Koil Kelvi" or Superintendent under the control of Sri Tatacharya. One other thing also may be remembered. It was a time when no such animosity between Tenkalais and Vadakalais existed as we wit- ness nowadays. Even though the Jiyar was a Tenkalai who 
155 
hailed from Mysore and whose headquarters is still at Melkote in Mysore he could have come and camped at Kanchi to wor- ship the Lord during the 16th century. As an ardent Vaishnavite devotee he would have been only too glad to supervise these sacred works under the guidance of the Tatacharya, So there is nothing contradictory or surprising about the mention of this Jiyar's name casually in some of the inscriptions. But the author maker a mountain out of a mole-hill. Let us now see the other aspects dealt with here which are also wrong in many respects. 
Page 44: As Dr. K. V. Raman is not prepared to accept that the present Abode of the Lord is a Hill, he has purposely put inverted commas to the word, Hill. We may also equally stress that this is a small, natural hillock, now completely covered by construction. If it is an artifical mound as the author asserts, it could not have withstood the colossal structures upon it and Sri Narasimha's shrine below it, would have crumbled by its weight. Despite his persistence about his theory in chapters III, IV, VII and VIII we can even now see the original features of the 'rock' over the Garbagraha of Sri Narasimha's shrine and on the wall of the twenty-four steps leading to Hastigiri. 
The author has ignored to mention the Kacchivaaitan Mantapa in the north-east corner of the prakara in the Hill and also the figure of the lizard. The paintings in the ceiling depicting the Kalakshepagoshti of Nadadur Ammal with the figures of Sudarsanasuri, Atreya Ramanuja, Vedantadesika and others are completely ignored. 
There is a small mantapa with a flight of ten steps leading to the twentyfour steps. This mantapa has on its top the figures of lion and not 'garuda' as in every corner of the top of the walls of all prakaras. Likewise we can notice the figures of two lions on both sides of 'garudas' on the corners of the outer-prakara (Periya Tirumadil) 
Page 45: The author's inference regarding the conse cration of Malayala Nacchiyar that 'perhaps it was a result of the brief conquest of Kanchi by the Chera King Ravivarman 
56 
Kulasekara in A.D. 1316, etc.' is not in accordance with the tradition attached to it. The tradition is that a Malayala (Kerala) princess was enchanted by the Lord's divine beauty and just like Goda (Andal) she vowed that if she would marry at all, she would marry only the Lord. Her royal father finding it difficult to change her heart, brought her with all riches, pomp and splendour to the Temple to offer her to Him: Just as the princess entered the doorway leading to the Dwarapalakas on the Hill, she disappeared and joined her Divine Husband. To illustrate this anecdote there is still a painting of the Malayala Nachiyar on the south wall next to the Dwarapalaka where her 'andardyanam' (disappearance) is said to have taken place. Another version is that our Lord Varadaraja's name is "GIRISAN" i.e. the Lord of the Giri or mountain (Hastigiri). Girisan in Tamil is 'Malayalan' His Nachiyar or Consort is therefore called Malayala Nachiyar. For the purposes of celebrating the marriage or Kalyana festivals this Nachiyar was installed and consecrated by our forebears in a standing posture to suit the occasion. (Sri Perundevi Tayar is consecrated in a sitting posture). The important Panguni Uttra Kalyana Festival takes place to this Nachiyar and the Lord, in all grandeur even now, which may justify this version. 
Page 46: The mention of Sri Alavandar's "Historic Meeting" with Sri Ramanuja in the third prakara is not quite in consonance with our Guruparampara. It is true Sri Alavandar observed from a distance his future disciple (Sri Ramanuja) from this courtyard or 'murram' when the latter was proceeding to worship Lord Varadaraja along with his teacher Yadava Prakasa. But Sri Yamunai Turaivar (Alavandar) stopped short without attempting to meet him This change in his idea was said to be that he (Sri Alavandar) wanted him (Sri Ramanuja) to complete his learning (of Purva paksha) under his advaita Guru Yadavaprakasa, without being disturbed in the middle, so that he might be able to tackle all the aspects later under his guidance. Therefore, he is said to have offered his benedictions to him from the distance with a prayer to the Lord of Hastigiri.* 
57 
With that he returned to Srirangam with the idea of sending for him later. The story proceeds that Sri Alavandar could not meet him before he reached the Lotus feet of the Lord and Sri Ramanuja who was hastening to offer his obeisance to him to Srirangam heard the news of his expiry even before he could reach Srirangam. It is said also that in his utter disappointment he returned to Kanchi after the cremation of Sri Alavandar and after taking a vow that he would fulfil the three aspirations of Sri Alavandar (Sri Bashya, Sahasranama Bashya and Bagavat Vishaya) which he learnt through his 
disciples, even without worshipping Lord Ranganata5.

Page 47: Here starts again the author's story of the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar's performances. The item mentioned here is 'the front porch with the balustraded stepped entrance' of the Abisheka Mantapa. He surmises that this 'was probably constructed in the 16th century by one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar, etc.' As pointed out in the outset, of this chapter and accepted also by the author at the end of this chapter, the Vijayanagar rulers, were the ones, who had all these items constructed, during the 16th century, under the guidance of their Acharyas the Tatacharyas. The Jiyar was not their guru or inspirer. The royal dynasty of the Vijayanagar, had their inspiration only through their spiritual gurus, the TATACHARYAS. The author's surmise is therefore, neither supported by history nor inscriptions. Since the author himself is not sure of his ground, he carefully puts it as, 
was probably constructed.....by the Jiyar'. 
Page 49: The Mahanavami Mantapa has some inscriptions in its ceiling. We are not sure whether Dr. K. V. Raman has seen them or knows about them. Dr. K. V. Raman says this Mahanavami Mantapa was built by Alagia Manavala Jiyar. This is contrary to the tradition and inscriptions on the ceiling. This and the mantapa leading to Sri Tayar Shrine south of the Abisheka Mantapa are said to have been constructed by Sri Sankaracharya. His portraits are carved in the pillars of the leading Mantapa. The Madwas also lay claim to these portraits as that of their guru, Madwacharya. They are carved not only 
58 
in the pillars of the mantapa in front of Sri Tayar's Shrine but also in the four pillared Mantapa, in the steps of the southern side of the Ananta Saras (Pushkarani or tank) which is called the Tirtavari Mantapa. Vasantotsava Tirtavari or Avabrata- Snana takes place here. At any rate the author's version that this mantapa was built by Alagia Manavala Jiyar in the middle of the 16th century cannot therefore be correct. 
The 350 inscriptions found all over the fabric of the Temple gives the names of hundreds of donors to the various construc- tions and to the religious, social and other purposes and those who were entrusted to manage these trusts. But all those persons mentioned cannot be said to have held the management of the Temple itself. The hundred pillared mantapa which the author styles as the Kalyanamantapa, is also mentioned as the Jiyar's work which is also not true. This will also be dealt with later in detail. 
The author gives a very new name to the Andal Unjal court- yard,as "Alagiya Manavala Tirumurram" adjacent to Sri Tayar Shrine. This may be or can be "Sri Manavalan Tirumurram” and not "Alagiya Manavala Tirumurram". Long ago, it is said that one of the "Panchaberas" enshrined in the main Sanctum Sanctorum of Lord Varadaraja behind Sri Selvar or Bali-Bera, used to be taken to Sri Tayar Shrine in the night. He is called "Sayna Bera" meaning One who sleeps along with the Devi. The night's last offering to Sri Tayar is used to be accompanied by a separate quantity of nivedana to be offered to this Sayana Bera or Manavala as he is called. This is called "Tirusadam meladai." This 'meladai,' a separate quantity of "Tirusadam" is even now sent along with the last nivedana to Sri Tayar, though the practice of taking Sri Manavalan the "Sayana Bera" to Sri Tayar Shrine had been stopped, when and why we are unable to guess. On the morning Sri Manavalan will be brought out of Sri Tayar Shrine and placed in the Unjal Mantapa. Then, when the Alankara Tirumanjanam comes with the paraphernalia, pipers etc., He will be taken along with it to the Hill in procession. Hence this "murram" in front of the Unjal Mantapa may be "Manavala Tirumurram". The author evidently in his obsession of the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar sought

to call it as Alagiya Manavala Tirumurram for which there is no authority. 
The name "Tondaradippodi" is there ever since this second enclosure was constructed which was very much earlier than that of Todarmal. Simply because the statue of Todarmal' is placed near the Tondaradippodi, its name cannot be twisted as "Todar- malpadi" as the author would like to have it. The statues, three in number in a niche next to Tondaradippodi-vasal are not also that of Todarmal. They must be of one of the Vijaya- nagar Kings, his son and wife, most probably Venkata I.

Page 51 Under "Ananta Saras (Pushkarani), the sacred tank" the author, in describing the Krishna and Varaha shrines, says that their "rear portion go very near but do not abut the outer compound wall of the temple". This is clearly a proof of the author's lack of personal knowledge, The ', Varaha" Shrine abuts the outer compound wall whereas there is a gap only in the rear of the "Krishna" shrine. The descriptions regarding the "Krishna Shrine" and "Varaha and other ruined Shrines" in this page are also lacking in exactitude. Regarding the former, it is called as "Sri Venugopalan's Shrine and not "Krishna Shrine" according to the Temple records. Secondly the Mulavar idol is always there. The author's version that it is now without the Deity' is wrong. It may be stated at this juncture that this Shrine was recently renovated and pujas restored by the trustee Sri R. T. Tatacharya at a cost of Rs. 10,000/-.As regards the latter, "Varaha" Shrine, this was also renovated recently by the Mudal Tirumaligai Tatacharya brothers of Srirangam (familiarly known as Thatham Brothers) and pujas restored after sampro- kshana, at a cost of more than twenty thousand rupees. The author says that further north also to the Varaha Shrine 'there is a ruined unused mantapa' There is no such mantapa to the north of the Varaha Shrine. Probably he means the one on the south. 
The author betrays here one more instance of his lack of personal knowledge when he says under "Dorai Thottam (Garden)" that the annual Davana Utsava (Garden Festival) for Lord Varadaraja is celebrated here, in the month of Chaitra 
60 
(April). This is patently wrong since the Davanotsava to the Lord takes place in this Dorai Tottam during the month of Masi (February). He cites "an epigraph of Sadasiva dated Saka 1473" for this, as mentioning the festival in the Vasanta Thoppu in the month of Chitirai. Probably this refers to the 'Thoppu' festival which used to be celebrated in the month of Chitrai at the garden some four furlongs south of the Temple, on the southern outskirts of Kanchi on the bank of the river Vegavati. At any rate neither the festival can be called as Davanotsava nor the Thoppu' as Dorai Thottam as stated by the author. There is a reference to a gift of land for certain festivals in the sixteen pillared mantapam situated in the 'Viswapanditar Thoppu to Viswapanditar son of Timma Pandita and grand son of Viswapandita, agent of Ettur, Tirumala Kumara Tatacharya, for the merit of the latter' in the reign of Venkatapati Deva Maharaya". A correct version of the festival is given on page 108 somehow. 
C 
This may be either due to the author's confused state of understanding, as we have been saying, due to his lack of definiteness, concerning our Temple's history or his unwilling- ness to recognise the importance of this festival which is celebrated in this garden for several centuries under the auspices of the Tatacharyas to whom it belongs. This garden or "Thoppu " is also popularly called as "Dharmakartha Garden". One Viswapanditar agent of Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya was given a gift of land towards performing the festival, by Venkatapati Deva Maharaya, in this garden in the month of Chitirai, for "the merit of" Sri Tatacharya, his Acharya. Hence, the name "Viswapanditar Thoppu " derived at that time. The festival is subsequently being continued till today without break by the descendants, the Tatacharya trustees. This is one of the most beautiful festivals of the year and celebrated on the next day of the return of the Lord from Aiyangarkulam festival on the Chitra Purnami day. Venkata- pati Deva Maharaya evidently wanted to celebrate this peaceful and restful festival to the Lord after the strenuous one previously at Aiyangarkulam, Nadabavi and river Palar. The Aiyangarkulam festival on the banks of the river Palar and the Tottam festival on the banks of the river Vegavati are the two 
61 
most important and grand festivals of the year commemorating Sri Tatacharya's signal services to the Temple.

Page 53 Under "Kalyana Mantapa" the author repeats his pet theory that it appears to have been built by Alagiya Manavala Jiyar in the latter half of the sixteenth century A. D. evidently under the royal patronage'. The Jiyar's portrait figures are sculptured on two pillars of the Mantapa". We strongly refute these two averments as baseless and false. The author has given a list of photographic illustrations of the Kalyana Mantapa. If as he asserts here, it is true that the "Jiyar's portrait figures are sculptured on two pillars of this Mantapa", he would not have failed to take the photos of these two and display them to establish his case. This only shows the barrenness of his assertion. The author himself is not sure of his statement and hence it is, he carefully uses the words "appears 
and "evidently" with regard to its construc- tion by the Jiyar. 
99 
The Vijayanagar style of building as evidenced here, is also noticed in mantapas in the temple of Virupaksha at Hampi, at Srirangam, Rameswaram and in the Jalakanteswara temple at Vellore Fort. 
One point is worthy of note in this connection. The patrons who financed the construction of temples and building the structures, were, as far as our Temple is concerned, the Cholas in the early stages and Vijayanagara rulers later. Under their patronage these constructions were carried out. If in this hundred-pillard mantapa (which is not commonly known as Kalyana-mantapa), there is a figure of a Sanyasin it cannot be identified with that of Alagia Manavala Jiyar, who flourished during the reign of Sadasivaraya and who was not at any rate the spiritual preceptor of any ruler of the Vijayanagara. Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika (1509-1591) the royal precptor of the Vijayanagar rulers started constructing this mantapa. This receives support from the old sloka: Namaskrtya gajadrisam preritastena tadbalaat mantape satapadhakye Tata- desika nirmite. Tatadesika means evidently Panchamata- banjanam Tatadesika. Lakshmikumara Tatadesika completed this mantapa and others which his father began, adding some 
62 
more artistic items and figures in it and many other structures in the Temple'. There is a sloka in the stotras, in praise of Sri Lakhmikumara Tatadesika, composed by his eldest son Sri Tirumala Tatadesika. It starts with "Sow Varnam Sikaram" and ends with "Chitra Stamba Satavrutham - Tribuvanascharyavahan Mantapam meaning the hundred- pillard Mantapa. 
99 
In the latter half of the sixteenth century Sri Lakshmi- kumara Tatadesika who was the Srikaryadurandara (Manager- General of Temple Affairs) had at his command the resources of the Vijayanagar Kings. According to Prapannamrtam. Venkata entrusted the whole kingdom to Tatacharya and himself led a life of retirement". 
The Dipastamba in a single stone is a marvel that should have attracted the attention of historians and archaeologists. Its non-mention is inexplicable. While the author has taken care to note the figure of Tirukkacchinambi in all pillars of the four-pillard mantapas in the Tirumurraveli (courtyard), he has ignored to note the carving at the lower end of the pillar in the north-east, of Ramanuja and Mahapurna beneath the Vakula tree and Yadavaprakasa in the form of Udumbu eating the remnants of food taken by Sri Vaishnavas. 
On pp 54-55, Dr. K.V. Raman chooses to refer to Manavala- mamuni's Kanchi Divya Desa Sangraha Slokamalika and com- ment upon it. The sloka as given on page 57 under footnote 34, has some mistakes and does not make clear the sense for certain words. Dr. K. V. Raman has not followed the order of the sloka while enumerating them on pp 54-55. For instance, Battanata is to be mentioned after Varahavapusha. Purnam refers to Mahapurna and this has been left out. The practice according to tradition, is to climb the steps to reach Sri Rama's shrine.and come to Tayar's shrine after going through the third prakara. Garuda's shrine is opposite to Narasima's and the order is wrongly stated by the author. Chakrattalwar is Hetisa and Anantalwar is Bogisvara. There is no strength in saying that the Chakrattalwar's shrine was built in the second prakara in Vijayanagar times. If this were the case, there must be some vestige for this shrine in the third prakara. According to tradition, there are two or200 SAW.

more sacred pools in the Anantasaras tank in the second prakara, The pool in front of Chakrattalwar shrine is said to be "Chakra Tirta" and the one in front of Varaha's shrine on the northwest corner, "Varaha Tirta". So, the author's inference at page 55 that the Chakrattalwar shrine was "probably" originally in the third prakara and was subsequently "built in its present position i.e., in the fourth prakara" has neither historical basis nor related to physical facts. The author describes this prakara wherein the Chakrattalwar's shrine is situated, as the fourth prakara, whereas it is actually in the second prakara, if counted from the outermost prakara of the Temple consisting of the four Mada Streets around the Periyatirumadil. 
Page 56 The author repeats here what he has said on page 49 that 'the compound wall of the third prakara 'was reconstruc- ted by Alagiya Manavala Jiyar in the 16th century'. What is the basis of this assertion and why he had to reconstruct it when the author himself cites here the inscription which says that this 'lofty stone-built prakarawall that cannot be destroyed by time' is beyond one's comprehension. This sort of reiteration alone cannot in any way help to establish his theory about the Jiyar constructing all these items, without advancing valid proofs. 
Lastly the author's concluding portion of this chapter is worthy of note. He says "moreover the Vijayanagar monarchs who zealously fostered the best Hindu traditions evinced sympathetic interest in fulfilling the religious aspirations of the people. Thus under their patronage were built the towering Gopura on the east; the Kalyana Mantapa, the Tulabara Mantapa, the Unjal Mantapa and the Vasantha Mantapa and probably separate shrines for Alwars and Acharyas. This was indeed the brightest period in the history of the temple when there was a great spurt in the celebration of festivals in the elaborate arrangements for offerings in the various benefactions of lands, jewels etc., as will be shown in the sequel". This is almost true from history, inscriptions, etc. These Vijayananagar Kings were inspired only by Sri Kumara Tatacharya their spiritual guru and his venerable ancestors and descendants in coming forward with their offer of munificence towards these important services described above. 
64 
The author should have noted that the Mahanasa (Kitchen) and the Shrine of Tayar are located at the places assigned according to the Pancharatra Agamas.
