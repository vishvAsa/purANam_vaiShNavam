  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-IV THE ROLE OF THE TEMPLE IN THE GROWTH OF VAISHNAVISM In the ‘Introduction’ as well as on page 88 of the concluding portion of this chapter the author maintains that our Temple was ’not prominent in the beginning’. He bases this stand on the absence of any reference to Sri Varada, by the early Alwars, Poigai and Peyalwars, though admitting at the same breath that Budatalwar - one of the early Alwars has sung in praise of Him as ‘Attiyuran’. This is strange logic indeed! His stand is that ‘Vehka’ (The Yatoktakarin Temple) ‘was the most prominent’ Vishnu Temple at Kanchi in the beginning by virtue of its having been sung by Poigai and Peyalwars. But we would like to point out that the origin of the Lord at ‘Vehka’ was necessitated in order to prevent- the ‘Vegavati’ which was rushing to destroy the ‘Yaga’ performed by Brahma, before whom, it is said in the Puranas, Sri Mahavishnu emerged in all His effulgence as Lord Varada1 It is highly difficult to determine the priority or otherwise of one temple to another. The songs made by an Alwar about a temple or their absence cannot by themselves determine the ancient character of a temple. With our limited know- ledge and insight into the past occurrences, we fail thoroughly to settle this issue. It is prudent to admit that almost all the temples were there since very earliest times but they had their structures built at various times by the different rulers. The temples at Madurantakam, Srimushnam Pandarpur, Puri (Jagannath) and other places were not taken note of by the Alwars. Which of these temples was more ancient than the other ? The author need not have entered into such unnecessary theories and discussions of questions of prominence, ancient or modern, about these two allied Temples. 66 On page 62 he says that Tirukkacchinambi &#34; asked him to bring daily a jarful of water from a well, known as ‘sala-well for the worship at the Varadaraja temple which Ramanuja faithfully carried out&#34;. This is not in consonance with the tradition found in the Guruparampara and the version of Vatukanambi a close and trusted disciple of Ramanuja. They say that Ramanuja started doing this service (Kainkaryam) on and from the time of his safe return to Kanchi after escaping from the plot hatched by his Advaitic Teacher Yadavaprakasa to kill him. It is said that our Lord and his Consort Perundevi Tayar guided him through the thick jungles to reach Kanchi in the guise of a hunter and huntress. At the place where the ‘sala-well’ is situated the hunter-couple feigned thirst and asked Ramanuja to fetch them water from the well. The Divine Couple disappeared after drinking two handfuls of water given by him. On coming out of the well with the third handful of water Ramanuja could not find his benefactors. Just then it was dawning and from the place be could see the Punyakoti Vimana of our Lord. He realised at once that his benefactors were no other than our Lord and his Consort and that he had reached the outskirts of Kanchi. This made him start this Tirta-kainkaryam. On page 65, the author writes, “Many of the reforms in the Temple set up and form of worship he introduced at Srirangam had their influence in this Temple as will be seen in latter chapters. In recognition of his great services, Ramanuja was deified in the Varadarajaswami Temple within fifty five years after his demise”. There is no evidence to support this contention. It is true that Ramanuja had special attraction for the Lord of our Temple. He does not appear to have introduced any reform in this Temple and hence there is no meaning in referring to them. On the other hand the fact that his disciples particularly Sri Nadadur Azhwan desired to have his image installed here and had it sanctified after his (Sri Ramanuja’s) demise is given in the Guruparampara. It is said 67 that Nadadur Azhwan took Sri Ramanuja’s permission for this, just before the latter’s demise. In the concluding portion of the ‘Introduction’ to this chapter, and under section 2 “Post Ramanuja period”, he deals with Ramanuja’s school of Vaishnavism. Here also he has started a most controversial theory of Sri Bashya or the northern school and Prabandic or southern school, implying a Vadakalai - Tenkalai cult2. The very terms are fallacious and contradictory, since both the Vadakalais and Tenkalais even now take pride in styling themselves as ‘Ubaya- Vedantins’, meaning that they swear by both Sri Bashyam and Bagavad-vishaya (Prabandas). It is only to misguide and confuse the uninformed and also the courts in the Tenkalai Vadakalai disputes, such theories were recently started by the ingenuity of the Tenkalai litigants. The Tenkalais claim themselves to belong to the southern cult or the Prabandic school (Tamil) and the Vadakalais, they say belong to the northern cult or Sri Bashya school (Sanskrit). By representing that they are pro-Tamils, they attempt to earn the sympathy and backing of the public of these parts who are all almost Tamilians. In the same way they try to mislead the courts also. A deeper study into the real significance of these two terms, will show the falsity of their claim. As said above both the sects revere Sri Satakopa (Nammalwar) and Sri Ramanuja (Bashyakar) and their works Divyaprabandas and Sri Bashya respectively. The author will be contradicting himself if he is going to say that the Vadakalais are more, if not ‘solely interested in Sri Bashya and Tenkalais in Bagavad- Vishaya, since the Tenkalais are equally vociferous in claiming to be the true followers of Sri Ramanuja (Emberumanar) the apostle of Visishtadvaita Siddanta. Specialising in a particular line of our Vaishnavite religion through certain scriptures by a person does not mean that the other scriptures are discarded by him or treated by him as against his cult. Sri Pillan, it was, upon whom the title of “Ubaya-Vedanta Simhasanadipati” was conferred by his Acharya Sri Ramanuja and adopted by him as his spiritual son. It is under the behests of the latter that Sri Pillan brought out the commentary, 68 “Arayirappadi”, the first gloss or interpretation of Tiruvaai- mozhi of Sri Nammalwar, otherwise called Bagavat-Vishaya. While directing Pillan to write a gloss on Tiruvaaimozhi, Ramanuja was influenced by the interest which Pillan evinced for this composition. Ramanuja also took into his consideration the fact that Pillan belonged to the family of Srimann Natamuni- kal. Yamuna too refers to Nammalwar as the Lord of his familys. It is but natural that Pillan should have been made the Chief for Ubaya-Vedanta. The Tatacharyas are the descen- dants of Pillan directly. So the bogey of two schools - Sri Bashya and Prabandic - northern and southern raised by the author has no basis, since they are not opposed to each other. The author himself concedes that there was no sectarian rancour even until and after Vedanta Desika’s time between the two schools and they are of recent origin,and “it is untenable to say that Vedanta Desika did not know the Tamil Prabandams”. The two schools, if schools they can be called, are not contra- dictory but complimentary to each other. They do not pres- cribe or teach the distinctions of Tenkalai - Vadakalai sampra- dayas or practices as we observe in these days. like the “tons- uring of widows”, sect marks etc. These two interpretations, not two schools, of Vedas and Prabandas are the two eyes of a true Vaishnavite. But the author for reasons best known to himself brings out here, his own theory that they are two different schools. He blows both hot and cold when he says that “even regarding the texts, the difference was one of preference. In fact, most of the followers of Rama- nuja like Embar, Battar, Kurukesa, Nanjiyar, Nampillai, Periya- vacchan Pillai, Pillailokacharya, Vedanta Desika and others were well versed in both Sanskrit and Tamil lore. In their works they struck a balance by adopting the manipravala style a free mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil words etc.” Striking a balance may mean, as though there is a difference between these two scriptures which are in Sanskrit and Tamil. The ‘manipravala’ is only a script apopted by our elders containing both Sanskrit and Tamil words. Loosely used, they create confusion. After saying that the above mentioned Acharyas were well versed in both, the author attributes that the differences and cleavages between the 69 two studies, started later. Here also we cannnt agree with the author. It is not the difference between the two studies but the difference between the the two sects viz the Tenkali and Vadakalai with regad to their ‘sampradayas’ or pratices. These differences are not taught by the ’two studies’. This concept of distinction, based on the study of Sri Bashya and Bagavat- Vishaya which the author tries to introduce, is fundamentally wrong. Such sophisticated theories to delude the ignorant and uninformed are of recent origin and there is no place for such distinctions in our Vaishnavism. Sri Bashya interprets the Vedas, in Sanskrit and Bagavad-Vishya in Tamil. The philoso- phy contained in both of them is the same. Are not the Ten- kalai temples have Vedas and Mantras (Sanskrit) in their rituals and vice-versa the Vadakalai temples the Prabandas (Tamil) ? Vedanta Desika asserts that there is no contradiction in the traditions followed by the pupils of the author of the Sri Bashya with reference to what these traditions mean. If at all there is any contradiction, it is only in the way of offering the purport by bringing together the words occurring in the passages in question. The ‘Sastras’ permit any difference that arises in the traditions due to place, time aud stages or conditions in life. If those ignorant of tradition choose to interpret according to their free will, then the defects belong only to those who speak of them 50. But in the litigations of the Tenkalai-Vadakalai disputes in our Temple and elsewhere, we may find instances of each beli- ttling the other in order to establish his own right as superior. To be more clear, the Tenkalais who are the office-holders of Adyapakam (Tamil Prabandas) in our Temple will assert that their service alone is very essential and that no other service even exists. On the other hand, the Vadakalais who are the Vedaparayana mirasdars will try to claim that their service alone is essential and the Prabandas are not necessary for the pujas or services in the Temple. Stranger still is the position with regard to the Temple at Tiruvahindrapuram in South Arcot District, which is purely a Vadakalai one. Here the dispute between the reciters of the Vedas and Prabandas are between Vedakalais . . 70 themselves, each trying to decry the other and rushing to courts, criminal and civil to establish their rights. By such ugly squa- bbles caused on account of purely selfish motives to gain certain preferences in the temples, we cannot take it that the Vedas and Prabandas are themselves contradictory and conflicting to each other. These are super-imposed by interested litigants and have nothing to do with our religion or philosophy. The remakrs at the end of Page 66 and the beginning of Page 67 that “Similarly, Kurukesa and Vedanta Desika of the so-called Vadakalai group wrote works in Tamil”, etc. are not happily worded. By such remarks the author betrays only his sectarian bigotry. He could have avoided such biased expressions like ’the so-called Vadakalai group’. In fine, a Tenkalai may be a great Sri Bashya Adikari and a Vadakalai, a Bagavat-Vishya Adikari (specialist) as and accor- ding to his personal propensity. Therefore, it is not necessary or desirable to advance arguments for or against the one or the other, in treatises like this, especially when our Acharyas have handed down them both to us as the most equally sacred. The author further harps and develops this theory on page 68 again. He says “the main doctrinal difference between these ’two schools, may be summed up here”. Thus stating, he points out certain differences. They are based on the differential approaches by the two sects while interpreting certain concepts and theories regarding God and His qualities. They are enumerated as eighteen in number&#34;. They have been there in the Vaishnava Sampradaya since the time of Periyavacchan Pillai. Pillai Lokacharya and Vedanta Desika noted some of them and offered their remarks, admitting the interpretations which they found admissible and rejecting others. It is certainly wrong to find a basis for the split of the Vaishnavasampradaya into Vadakalai and Tenkalai. Inspite of these differences in the doctrines, the sampradaya did never choose to exhibit mutual dislike or hatred. These differ- ences did not cause the split.71 The very names Vadakalai and Tenkalai came into the picture long after the period of Manavala Mamuni. Certain practices dopted by a section of people were held by them as the most sacred, deriving their authority from the conduct of pious people taken to be the strict followers of tradition. Others who took objection to these are taken to belong to the other section taking to such acts which are opposed to theirs. This much is the difference that marks out the two sects as belonging to rival groups particularly evincing interest in Temples, rituals there and exercise of their rights. The two sects swear, on the sampradaya level by the eighteen differences which are needless to get elaborated here. The present-day dispute between the two sects has no sanction on the side of religion and philosophy, but neither of them has stopped the spread of mutual ill will. To say that Tenkalais are more liberal in their outlook with regard to caste-system and the Vadakalais are rigid is also a travesty of truth. As already observed above, it is only a device to play to the gallery and earn the sympathy of law officers. Both the Tenkalais and Vadakalais have regard to Alwars, who were from diffierent castes. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Vadakalai Acharya, had chosen to claim Tiruppanalwar, a Harijan by birth, as Nampananathan (our Pananathan) 5b. He has even written a commentary on his (the Alwar’s) &#34; Amalanadipiran “, by name “Munivahana-Bogam”. Sri Desika also swears by the Prabandas of Alwars. The Tenkalais who claim to be the followers of Ramanuja could not find a single work of Sri Ramanuja in Tamil. Will they give him up because of this? All that was in Sanskrit originally viz the Vedas, Sutras, Upanishads, Gita etc., were reproduced as it were, in Tamil, by the Alwars. Later, our Acharyas reproduced them again in Sanskrit, according to the times and needs of the society towards its emancipation. Sidditrayam Geetartha Sangraham, Stotra- Ratnam and Chatussloki of Sri Alavandar, Sri Bashya, Geeta Bashya, Gatya Trayam etc., of Sri Ramanuja, Panchastavams by Sri Kurattalwar and the Stotras of Parasara Batta and other Acharyas like Sri Vedanta Desika in Sanskrit are all almost the interpretations of the Divyasuktis of Alwars, which in turn were the interpretations of the Vedas’. 72 We are really fed up with such distortions and misinter- pretations with regard to our great religion advanced both in the law courts and outside by this sect, adnauseam, to gain certain narrow ends, through their journals and other media. So let us proceed to Section 3 of this Chapter IV. The author concedes in the beginning of this section that the Vijayanagar Kings during the 16th century A. D. have extended their patronage on a lavish scale to the Vaishnava Acharyas and constructed the several mantapas, gopuras, vimanas etc., in the Sri Varadarajaswamy Temple. So far, so good. But in, so say- ing he wants to make it appear that one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar was the chief architect of these constructions. There are some inscriptions about this Jiyar. But nowwhere in these or any- where else it is said that he constructed the Kalyana Mantapa, the Rampart walls and the front Mantapa of the Tayar Shrine. There is also no mention of his connection with the Vijayanagar rulers either as a guru or adviser in these inscriptions. They simply mention some gifts by him to the Temple and in one of them as the Koil-Kelvi or Superintendent or Manager even. Excepting the author’s assertion, there is no other proof or basis that this Jiyar was the architect of all these construc- tions. On the other hand we have positive evidence of inscri- ptions, history and records to establish that the Tatacharyas who were the recognised royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar rulers, were alone responsible in securing the royal patronge for all these monumental works. This, the author himself accepts without naming the “Vaishnava-Acharyas” to whom they “extended their patronage “9. There are evidences in support of this10 Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika and his father Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika are admittedly, the spiritual preceptors or royal gurus of Kings Krishnaraya, Sadasiva Raya, Ramaraya, Sriranga and Venkata I “. These constructions took place during the times of these Kings only. viz 16th century A. D. The readers may draw their own conclusions from this. We are certainly one with the author in calling this period (16th century when these Kings were reigning) as “a golden age for Vaishnavism and Vijayanagar Kings “who oleration as evidenced by also for the Temple.” The despite their despite their general religious their charities to both Siva and 73 Vishnu Temples seem however in later times to have developed a special predilection to Vaishnavism and to have made the the Varadaraja temple an object of their special adoration” 12. The author next deels with the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420 to 1468 A. D., calling him as “the most prominent Jiyar at Kanchi in the post-Manavala Mamuni period”. But this Jiyar does not find a place in any of the inscriptions of our Temple. The T. T. D. inscriptions mention the activities of certain Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati. From this, the author without any connection or relevance starts saying abruptly that this Jiyar of the 15th century “seems to have held a similar position at Kanchi from the last decade of the 15th century”. But this Jiyar did not even see the last decade of the 15th century A.D. since even according to the author, this Jiyar did not live after 1468 A.D. The first two paragraphs of this section regarding the “Alagiya Manavala Jiyar” are most confusing and contradictory as can be seen from the way in which the author while describing one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar at Kanchi, suddenly turns to some other Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati and comes to describe again a different Jiyar of the same Math as having lived at Kanchi as the preceptor to one Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar. Further while speaking about the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420-1468 A.D. the author says that he (the Jiyar) is mentioned in &#34; several inscriptions datable to the latter balf of the 15th century and the earlier half of the 16th century”. Though the author freely speaks “of his services to the Temple and his eminent position in the Temple affairs of Kanchi”, he has not given any idea about the particulars of the inscriptions in which he is mentioned. We will have to be very guarded therefore, in giving them credence or taking them for granted without any reliable data or basis. As stated by us at the outset, to section 3 of this chapter, the Jiyar of the 16th century finds a place in some of the inscriptions. In those times when there was no such ill-feelings as we witness in these days between the Tenkalais and Vadakalais the management or supervision of the Temple works, worship and conduct of festivals were entrusted with and allotted to those who were 74 sincere and devoted without any distinction of sect or even caste. The Tatacharyas who were “the Manager-General of Temple Affairs” could not themselves attend to each and every item of the stupendous works they had started not only in our Temple but also in the other Temples at Kanchi and elsewhere. Naturally, this Jiyar who was a pious and sincere devotee might have been entrusted with ‘some of the works and services by them as an agent. In some of the inscriptions occur the names of such agents like Tirumalai Nambi Chakrarayarı3, Ramanujayyan of Tiruppullani’, Alagiyasingar17, Tiruppani Singarayyangar1, Emberumanar Aiyyan”, Tiruvengada Aiyangar17a, Viswa- pandita’s, Vaidyanatha Iyer18a, Jana Mudaliar, etc.186. It is learnt from these that in those times, “the several affairs of the Temple were assigned to different persons or bodies each in his or its time attended to the work for which he or it was nominated “”. Thus it is quite possible that Alagiya’ Manavala Jiyar was also entrusted with some of the works that were progressing under the aegis of the Tatacharyas as an agent which caused the mention of his name in some inscriptions. There are also similar inscriptions in our Temple about Ahobila swamis, Sankaracharyas, Madwacharyas and other pro- minent persons, mentioning about their gifts of villages and services to our Temple, during the same period (16th century A. D). Several other inscriptions describe the various offerings of devotees at different times!9a. These dignitaries who are equally, if not more prominent are not known to lay any such extravagant claims to the authorship of the major constructions in the Temple on the basis of their gifts or services in the 16th century A.D. The author gives an exaggerated account similarly with regard to the Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan20, Paravastu25, and Prativadi Bayankaram22 families on the basis of one or two inscriptions, he was able to delve from the ocean of inscriptions mentioning some gifts and services by them. Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan or Ayyangar was a disciple of Alagiya 75 Manavala Jiyar23. He was in charge of Ramanuja Kutams at Tirumalai, Kanchi and other places24. He was instrumental for the conduct of some festivals in several places including Kanchi25. But the author is not justified in exaggerating his contributions to our Temple. A report of the Archaeological Department26 describes these Vaishnavites in the following manner, who existed during the time of Achyutaraya. “Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar, Paravastunayanar and Vada Tiruvenkada Jiyar are some of the names occurring in the inscriptions of this King’s reign and the distinguishing prefixes of Kandadai and Paravastu are found among the family names of important Vaishnavite families, like the Tatacharyas of Conjeevaram”. The italics is by us to show, even then, they are compared with the prominent Tatacharya family. On page 82, the author gives an account of the Tatacharya family in his own way. He acknowledges that the Vijayanagar monarchs of the earlier period gave their high respects to the forefathers of the Tatacharyas. He next deals with Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya casually saying that “he lived in the court of Ramaraya “. He proceeds further to say that one branch of the Tatacharya family settled down at Kanchi during the time of Sriranga I (1572-1585 A. D.).. This statement is not correct. The Tatacharyas might have been visiting the courts of Vijayanagar Kings or even stayed there at times for longer periods. They might have been called with the prefixes of the names of places they had been staying, for the sake of distinguishing them from other local persons. But from a long time past their orginial homes were only Kanchi, Kumbakonam and Tirumalai“. Next the author’s comment (on page 83) that “the specific mention of Tatacharya’s agreement to perform the Janma- nakshatram of Manavala Mamuni on his annual birth day is indeed very significant as it shows his devotion to this acharya is very amusing. Without making any distinction, the great Tatacharya might have magnanimously and out of respect to a Vaishnavite devotee consented to do this. The author has been a bit careless in using the word devotion. Devotion is displayed generally to God, parents and Acharyas. It is not 76 shown indiscriminately to any Acharya but to one’s own and to the line of Acharyas who belong to him. Respect could have been a better word. It is needless to remark that a true Vaishnava should show his respect to everyone who is a Vaish- nava, whether he be a friend or a foe. Being an ardent Vaish- nava, how could he have refrained from showing his consider- ation to Manavalamamuni, a Vaishnavite Acharya? This occurr- ence should open the eyes of the warring members of both the sects as to the need to cultivate a healthy attitude on the lines taken up long ago by Sri Tatadesika. He had also contributed to the Vedapuriswarar Temple, when approached, liberally towards the construction of a mantapa, at Tirukkalikunram. This religious tolerance, benevolence and magnanimity should not be taken as devotion to that particular sect or religion, by the donor. We are led to believe the author has used the word ‘devotion’ here intentionally in order to derive a pleasure lacking in taste. On Page 84 of this Chapter IV, he says that because of the fall of Vijayanagar Kings, the family of “Ettur Kumara Tata- charya moved to Srirangapatna, the capital of the Mysore Kings, in the latter half of the 17th century in search of better for- tunes”. This is not only derogatory to the great family and its greater ancestor who were solely responsible for the construction of temples, endowing of properties towards the maintenance of Temples in general and our Temple in particular making of the several vehicles, ornaments and various other important necess- aries to our Temple, the philanthropic deeds like the construction of big lakes at Aiyangarkulam and Tenneri called “Tata- samudram “, the establishment of Agraharas (Villages) etc., but uncharitable and wrong to say that they migrated to Mysore “in search of better fortunes”. The fortune and wealth which the Tatacharyas acquired from out of their position, as the royal gurus (preceptors) to the Vijayanagar rulers for nearly three centuries would have sufficed to maintain several generations in royal splendour if they had but appropriated them for their own personal use. History, inscriptions and othor ancient works like Prapannamratam, Sadvamsa Guna Kirtanam, Maha Vamsa Mahimai etc., mention about the selfless services of the Tata- 77 charya family and their undying enthusiasm towards the uplift of the temples. That was the only goal and aim of life of that great Lakshmikumara Tatadesika his ancestors and his descen- dants. In order to make out an imaginary case for Tenkalai influence in the Temple at this period he has to avoid the pre- sence of the Tatacharyas and their influence at that period. To avoid this embarassing situation he has started on a theory on page 85 that the Stanatar who were managing the Temple affairs entrusted the management to Todarmal and that he in his turn gave it to his Acharya Attan Jiyar in the beginning of the 18th century. This is completely wrong. The Attan Jiyar agree- ment also will falsify this story. What was the necessity to enter into an agreement with a non-existent family! To get over this, the author starts with yet another story of &#34; The Return of the Tatacharya Family to Kanchi in 1711” on page 86. To say that one Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya returned to Kanchi from Mysore in 1711 A.D is yet another piece of the author’s inventive genius. As already observed there were several members of the family who had remained at Kanchi and the family of Sri Venkatavarada Tatacharya alone left for Mysore. The family of “Venkata Varada” had not also left Mysore once and for all in 1711. They remained there till the middle of the 19th century as the royal preceptors of the Kings of Mysore28 visiting Kanchi off and on. They wielded great influence by which they not only spread Sri Vaishnavism but also secured several large amounts of wealth to our Temple. So, both the stories of the family leaving entirely for Mysore in the later half of the 17th century and returning in the beginning of the 18th century, are, on the face of it, distortions 29. When the Jiyar was all in all, as the trustee, why should he enter into an agreement with persons who had lost all touch with the Temple? These are patent misrepresentations that can be easily observed by a discerning eye. Could anybody by any stretch of imagination, conceive of the family abandoning and leaving in lurch everything they had so devoutly built, fondly reared and cherished and maintained for the sake of “seeking better 99 78 ortunes as if they were in need of it. As the unquestioned and great “Acharyapurushas” of the day they were sought after by the kings of Mysore, the Nayak Chieftains of Tanjore and others. Simply because some of them had to go to different places for some time as spitirual preceptors, it cannot be said that the entire family had once for all left Kanchi bag and baggage. Most of the descendants were certainly staying behind, to look after the Temple and other interests, while only one family, viz., that of Venkata Varadacharya, the second son of Kotikannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika, left for the court of Devaraja Wodeyar at Srirangapatnam (Mysore). The remaining sons were certainly staying behind at Kanchi. This is testified even according to the author, by an inscription on page 84 of his Treatise. But in the same breath, the author builds a story that the Tatacharya families left in its entirety for Mysore” in search of better fortunes”, to suit his theory of the Stalattars managing the Temple and subsequenty transferring it to Todarmal during the last and the beginning of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. We have given a detailed historical version of the continuous interest. influence and management of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika before and after the fall of the Vijayanagar dynasty, in part I of this book, regarding our Temple. 99 The next item is “Attan Jiyar on page 85. The Tatacharyas, who secreted the Utsavar idols of Sri Varada and Nachiyars to Udayarpalayam on account of the fear of Muslim depradation, were said to have been reeling in agony and despair due to the separation. It was further, heightened when they were unable to restore them back, after the scare subsided, by the refusal of the Zamindar of Udayarpalayam to part with the Idols. Accidentally and fortunately just then, there was present at Kanchi, one Attan Jiyar, who was the guru of Todarmalla the Chieftain of a regiment. This Jiyar who was a Telugu Brahmin Sanyasin had come to Kanchi fleeing Golkonda after the killing of his relatives Akkanna and Madanna by the forces of Aurangazeb 29a. The Tatacharyas approached this Jiyar for help in restoring the idols through his disciple Todarmalla. The 79 Jiyar readily agreed and made his disciple act. Todarmalla accordingly went to the Zamin with his regiment and forced the zamindar to part with the idols. Having thus secured back the images, the Tatacharyas were prepared to give anything to Attan Jiyar for this great help. But as a true Sanyasin he only desired that the Tanian or Sloka in praise of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni, “Sri Sailesa Dayapatram” should be allowed to be recited before the commencement of the recital of Prabandas in the Temple. To this, the Tatacharyas readily agreed. This consent has been given by an agreement called “Attan Jiyar Agreement” not an undertaking as Dr. K. V. Raman would name it. What more? They have even allowed him to run the affairs of the Temple itself, in their ecstatic moment. Thus leaving almost everything in his hands in good faith, they started going on tours of &#34; tours of “Sishyarjana” periodically. The judicial decisions in the second half of the 19th century will establish that Attan Jiyar and the scions of his family were running the administration of the Temple on behalf of the Tata- charyas until 1792, when one Rama Rao, the last of the Attan Jiyar family was dismissed by the then Collector for misbe- haviour. One Srinivasaragavachari a grand son by daughter of Tatacharya was appointed by the Government in 1794 to manage the affairs, as a deputy to Tatacharyas. Even this person’s term was terminated in 1796 and the Government took over the management under their direct control which lasted till 1842 when it was restored back to the Tatacharyas as the “original mirasdars” (“Church-Wardens’) of the Temple30. Still more fantastic, is the story that they were given this priority of honours by their undertaking to honour the Tenkalai traditions (mamul) of the Temple, as if there was such a tradi- tion. When a person is honoured on account of his worthiness nobody will take an undertaking from him. The author states here (Page 86 and 89) that this agreement or “undertaking” is the famous agreement known as Attan Jiyar Agreement and this “was signed by Ettur Immadi Lakshmikumara Tatacharya and delivered to Attan Jiyar”. This is not correct since “Sri Lakshmikumara Tatacharya” was not in the picture in 1711 A.D. 80 He lived between 1572 to 1632 A. D. One Lakshmikumara Tirumalai Tatacharya and some others were the signatories to it. This “Ettur Tirumalai Lakshmikumara” is an appella- tion and not a name by itself, and is prefixed to all the names of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika. Secondly, the presumption itself is wrong. As said above the Attan Jiyar had no such right or position’ to confer the right of Agratambulam on Tatacharyas. It was the Tatacharyas, on the other hand who conceded to Attan Jiyar his request to recite, the Tanian of his Acharya as a return for his help in restoring back the idols. The history of the Tatacharyas in connection with the Temple and the influence they wielded as the spiritual preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs are all narrated in glowing terms by the chroniclers of history and the inscriptions found in several temples of South India. From at least the 15th Century A. D., these Acharya Purushas of an exalted line of the Vaishnavite hierarchs, prescribed the mode of worship and ri uals to be observed in the Temple, as the Srikaryams of the Temple affairs. While so, the author’s story on Page 86 of his book that Attan Jiyar, a newcomer in 1710 A. D. to Kanchi conferred the Agratambulam honours on the Tatacharyas after taking an undertaking from them that they would honour the Tenkalai tradition and mode of worship in the Temple, to say the least, is ridiculous. “The Tatacharyas connected with this Temple were very orthodox in the observance of religious rites and rituals to their meticulous prefection as precribed in the scriptures. The same system of observance has been handed down to their posterity and is still observed&#34;3’. Still more strange is author’s conclusion that because of some Arulappadu honours conferred on one Nallanchakravarthy of Srirangam who was a Tenkalai in 1713 A. D, “the Tenkalai preponderance in the temple is confirmed”, “What has this to do with the Tenkalai preponderance in the Temple ? Sri Sankara- charya, Sri Madvacharya and many other devotees were given privileges and honours in the Temple in lieu of their services to the Temple in the past. The Ahobilamath “Jivars &#34; who are ardent Vadakalais are also honoured on certain occasions and honours and emoluments are even now sent with the TempleIC U U AVA U 244 U Some of the Temple Paraphernalia (P. 81) Sri Vishwaksenar (P. 113) Dwarapalakas at the Azhakiyasingar Vasal (III Entrance) (P. 81) Dwarapalakas on the Hastigiri (IV Entrance to the Garbagraham) பெருமாள்கோவில்ஸ்லம் (வீடகலை)-5 U (P. 81) Inscription “Perumal Koil Stalam-Vadamalai” on the Prakara of Hastigiri (P. 122) Sita, Rama &amp; Lakshmana (Mulavars &amp; Utsavars) with Hanuman (P. 81) D ல், சி Entrance View of the Mirror Room (P. 81) 81 paraphernalia on three occasions in the year even today, in memory of their past services. These cannot therefore indicate the predominance of any particular sect. The only criterion is the sect-mark worn by the Cheif Deity (Mulavar) and other, important deities of Gods enshrined in the Temple, like Sri Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, Varaha, Ranganatha, Karu- manicka Varada, Danvantrin, the Parijanas like Ananta, Garuda Vishwaksena, Dwarapalakas, Hanumans, Sudarsanalwar etc., the Paraphernalia, Vahanas, Utensils Curtains, Fans, Pillows etc. In this Temple all these have only Vadakalai marks. The first Tirtakars are admittedly the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The Archaka Paricharakas who officiate in the pujas are all Vadakalais. The Vadakalai marks are carved, embossed, painted and displayed all over the fabric of the Temple boldly in places like Gopuras, Prakaras, Vimanas, Walls and Entrances. Many of them are stone cut namams (See Illustra- tions.) These are definitely indicative of the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. But the author vainly puts up attempts to make out a case otherwise. The author wants us to understand that the Tenkalai mode of ceremonies and worship prevailed in the Temple by citing some documents32 connected with the litigation of the Temple. What are the modes of Tenkalai worship and what are what are the Tenkalai ceremonies we fail to understand, despite the author’s parrot- like assertions without clarity or truth. Strictly speaking there can be no Tenkalai or Vadakalai mode of worship in a Temple. The worship is performed according to the Agamas which are neither Tenkalai nor Vadakalai. But we generally call a temple Vadakalai or Tenkalai on the basis of sectarian marks and those who officiate in the pujas. Even on this basis our Temple is definitely Vadakalai, as aforesaid. If the temple’s character is to be determined on the basis of service holders, the majority of the services like Vedaparayanam, Puranam reading, Stotra- patam, Mantrapushpam etc., are in the hands of the Vadakalais. The Tenkalais have only the Adyapakam service in which the Vadakalais also participate. The author’s case fails here also. 82 The author’s next item of the subject matter in this Chapter IV is &#34; Vaishnava-Sect-Marks”. The author makes out a very big case for the preponderant Tenkalai sect marks in the Temple. These marks which the author delves from the ocean of Vadakalai marks in the Temple are comparable to a mouse and a mountain. As detailed above the innumerable Vadakalai marks all over the fabric of the Temple in the most prominent and important places, starting from the Chief Deity bear eloquent testimony to the Vadakalai character and pre- dominance in the Temple. The so-called Tenkalai marks do not belong to the Vijayanagar period as alleged by the author. The Vijayanagar Kings were all Vadakalai Vaishnavaites and disciples of the Tatacharyas33. They would not have allowed or caused the Tenkalai marks to be displayed. The insignificant marks were surreptitiously introduced during the latter half of the 18th century by the scions of Attan Jiyar family when they had a free hand in running the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the leading Tatacharyas who tours of Sishyartanas. When these tamperings were noticed on their return, the Tatacharyas tried to wrest the management from Rama Rao the last scion of the family of the Jiyar. This man resisted and refused to hand over back the charge of the Temple to the Tatacharyas. Thereupon the Tatacharyas who were then popularly called the ‘Brahmins’ by the authorities approached the Collector for removing him. The Collector finding Mr. Rama Rao, guilty of gross insubordination dismissed him in 1792 and appointed one Srinivasaragavachari to manage the Temple as a deputy of the Tatacharyas. It will be interesting to note the observation of Mr. Balfour, the Collector, in this regard on 7th May, 1792. He says, “as far as I am enabled to judge from the different conversation I have had with Brahmins’ and others regarding the disputants’ claims to the Church-wardenship, I am led to believe the ancestors of those men whose names, I now enclose, were the original Church-Wardens and that the ancestors of Mr. Rama Rao were put in by the former as their Gumastha or Manager.” The names forwarded by the Collector were those 83 of the ancestors of the respondents, Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya Sri Viraragava Tatacharya and Sri Gopala Tatacharya, in a suit filed by one Appoo Row claiming Darmakartaship as the descendant of Attan Jiyar, in O. S. 5 of 1844 in the Jillah Court of Chingleput. The suit was dismissed and an appeal was preferred in the Court of Suddar Udalut in A. S. No. 29 of 1849. The appeal was also dismissed. The Jillah Judge while dismissing the suit of Appoo Row observes as follows: the whole it appears to the Civil Judge firstly that the Plaintiff has no right or title to the office of Darmakartha, some of his ancestors having officiated only as Gumasthas, secondly that the Defendants’ ancestors, Tatachari having been in 1794 declared to be the rightful mirasdar by competent authority while also the Plaintiff or his father failed to institute proceedings within 12 years after the establishment of the Jillah Court, the Plaintiff’s claim even if he had shown a better one, than he has done would be barred by both sections 10 and 18, Regulation II of 1802.” The Court of the Suddar Udalut in dismissing the appeal observes as follows: “From 1792 upto the present time the right and title of the appellant to the privilege he now lays claim to, has never been recognised. Whereas during the same period the members of the family of the respondents have been considered the lawful warden of the pagoda in question. In 1792 a violent dispute arose between two sects of Brahmins the Tenkalai and Vadakalai fomented entirely by the misconduct of one Rama Rao the Gumastha of the original mirasdar which ended in the disgrace of Rama Rao who was declared by the Government forever disqualified for the office of Church-warden and prevented from any future interference with the Church or any of its ceremony. It is through the connection this person then had with the pagoda, that the appellant now chiefly rests his claim to the office of Dharmakartha. “All the authorities therefore for the last 57 years have had one opinion of the claims of the respondent’s family to the office he now holds, and on what grounds the appellants rests his hopes to dislodge them and obtain the appointment for himself, the Court fails to discover. The appellant’s exhibits 84 prove nothing in his favour whereas those of the respondents and the public records show most distinctly that their ancestors have always been considered and acknowledged to be the original mirasdars of the institution” A further appeal to the highest Court was also of no avail. 66 From the foregoing extracts it will be clearly seen that the few Tenkalai namams seen lurking in some insignificant places in the Temple represent the work of those who had opportunities to introduce them stealthily during the latter half of the 18th century. On the basis of such insignificant features of Tenkalai marks the author tries to make out that the Temple is a Tenkalai one. Another important factor that will belie the author’s assertion, in this regard, on Pages 85 and 89, can be noted while going through the report to the Government of Madras Archaeological Department.34 While describing the slab Bearing an inscription on both sides (639 of 1919) and embellished at its top with the Tenkalai Vaishnavite mark flanked on either side by a conch and a discus”, the report says in para 64 that “it is also one of the 12 items within the temple which bear this mark as distinguished from Vada- kalai which is the recognised mark of the TEMPLE and the God therein”. The italics is by us to show the indisputable nature or character of the Temple as Vadakalai. What else is required to show the utter uselessness and falsity of the claim of the author in this regard? We shall have occasion still further to prove the hollowness of this assertion in a later context. To recapitulate, the Tenkalai namams which the author mentioned both in writing and through photos carefully avoiding the Vadakalai namams, are the creations of the period when the Attan Jiyar’s heirs were looking after the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the prominent Tatacharya proprietors of the Temple during the second half of the 18th century. But even in these photos many Vadakalai marks appear. In the concluding portion of this chapter the author once again repeats about the ’two schools’ and says that the Tenkalais who belong to the Prabandic school are more liberal in their outlook towards the caste system and the Vadakalais are 85 conservative. In what manner they were more liberal is the question. The Tenkalai Brahmins who claim to be liberal do not even allow the non-brahmin devotees who are well-versed in the Prabandas to join them in the recitation in their goshtis in the temples which are places of public worship not to speak of their disinclination to receive the prasadams in their company but yet they proclaim their catholicity vociferously, just to delude the uninformed, as already stated. And on this claim of their liberal outlook, the author says that “the vast majority of the temples of South India came under the spell of the eclectic Tenkalai school including the Varadarajaswamy Temple.” Absurdity can go no further. The author goes on repeating the same version of the Tenkalai predominance to the end by bringing forward the names of certain Jiyars and Tenkalai Tirtakars and the insignificant Tenkalai namams found in the Temple. We can only say that a lie cannot become a truth by repeating it several times. We have already pinpointed the fact that our Temple from the very ancient times has been only Vadakalai and continues to be so. We will have occasion to prove the Vadakalai character of the Temple during the course of this treatise in the succeeding chapters also with still more materials and force. Before concluding this chapter it may be relevant to relate some more instances which will clinch the issue and establish the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Acharya of the Vadakalai sect, has certain unique and special honours and privileges in the Temple which no other Alwar or Acharya has. On his birthday, the annual Tirunakshatram day of Purattasi-Sravanam-his deities enshrined both at Tuppul (a place about two miles from the Temple where his Avatara or birth took place) and in the Temple are the recipients of exclusive and extraordinary honours. The celebration of the daylong Mangalasasanam festival to Sri Tuppul Desika and the usual Sattumurai festival to the Temple Desika after that, are the two tell-tale evidence of the Vadakalai character of the Temple. Sri Andal’s “Feast” at Sri Desika’s shrine on the Bogi Tiru-Kalyanam day with Alankara Tirumanjanam (Holy bath) Astanam, etc. from morning to evening may also be added to the list. (See also Appendix-D for full details). 86 In four instances, the author reveals that he did rely upon what others had told him. Among these, one is Appillar’s writing a commentary on the Sri Bashya (Page 70) which is, a news not heard of before by any Vaishnava scholars. The second (Page 71) is Krishna Misra’s defeat at the hands of Vedanta Desika. It is true that Mahacharya’s Vedanta Desika Vaibava Prakasika35 mentions this incident. This is not borne out by the periods when the two scholars flourished. Krishna Misra lived in the first half of the eleventh century while Vedanta Desika, two and a half centuries later. The third instance is his mentioning the admirer who wrote the Acharya. Champu without reference to his name (Page 72). The author of this work was Kousika Vedantacharya son of Venkatacharya36. So, the Acharyachampu and the Vaibava Prakasika do not contain anything like an acceptable and valid treatment for some of the incidents in Sri Desika’s life. It is not proper to dis- miss the statement found in the Vadakalai Guruparampara, for this may be taken to be directed against those who are jealous of Vedanta Desika’s eminence. Where is the evidence to take the Tenkalais as meant here ? It is also not correct to state that “the Tenkalai school in- stalled his image in almost all the Temples under their control and celebrated festivals for him”. First of all, as we had occa- sion to controvert the notion of Tenkalai (Prabandic) and Vadakalai (Sri Bashya) schools elsewhere in this book, there is no such division of schools during his time. It is very doubtful whether the Temples which the author claims to belong to his school were originally Tenkalai at all. On the other hand, it can very well be inferred that the Temples in which Sri Desika’s Deity is found installed should have been originally Vadakalai. It is also noteworthy that even the Temples of the so-called “Tenkalai School” of the present day are having the Desika’s idols with Vadakali mark only with one or two unfortunate exceptions. But even these one or two are of very recent conversion. PART II-CHAPTER IV FOOT NOTES">

  <meta itemprop="name" content="04 ROLE IN GROWTH OF VAISHNAVISM">
  <meta itemprop="description" content="CHAPTER-IV THE ROLE OF THE TEMPLE IN THE GROWTH OF VAISHNAVISM In the ‘Introduction’ as well as on page 88 of the concluding portion of this chapter the author maintains that our Temple was ’not prominent in the beginning’. He bases this stand on the absence of any reference to Sri Varada, by the early Alwars, Poigai and Peyalwars, though admitting at the same breath that Budatalwar - one of the early Alwars has sung in praise of Him as ‘Attiyuran’. This is strange logic indeed! His stand is that ‘Vehka’ (The Yatoktakarin Temple) ‘was the most prominent’ Vishnu Temple at Kanchi in the beginning by virtue of its having been sung by Poigai and Peyalwars. But we would like to point out that the origin of the Lord at ‘Vehka’ was necessitated in order to prevent- the ‘Vegavati’ which was rushing to destroy the ‘Yaga’ performed by Brahma, before whom, it is said in the Puranas, Sri Mahavishnu emerged in all His effulgence as Lord Varada1 It is highly difficult to determine the priority or otherwise of one temple to another. The songs made by an Alwar about a temple or their absence cannot by themselves determine the ancient character of a temple. With our limited know- ledge and insight into the past occurrences, we fail thoroughly to settle this issue. It is prudent to admit that almost all the temples were there since very earliest times but they had their structures built at various times by the different rulers. The temples at Madurantakam, Srimushnam Pandarpur, Puri (Jagannath) and other places were not taken note of by the Alwars. Which of these temples was more ancient than the other ? The author need not have entered into such unnecessary theories and discussions of questions of prominence, ancient or modern, about these two allied Temples. 66 On page 62 he says that Tirukkacchinambi &#34; asked him to bring daily a jarful of water from a well, known as ‘sala-well for the worship at the Varadaraja temple which Ramanuja faithfully carried out&#34;. This is not in consonance with the tradition found in the Guruparampara and the version of Vatukanambi a close and trusted disciple of Ramanuja. They say that Ramanuja started doing this service (Kainkaryam) on and from the time of his safe return to Kanchi after escaping from the plot hatched by his Advaitic Teacher Yadavaprakasa to kill him. It is said that our Lord and his Consort Perundevi Tayar guided him through the thick jungles to reach Kanchi in the guise of a hunter and huntress. At the place where the ‘sala-well’ is situated the hunter-couple feigned thirst and asked Ramanuja to fetch them water from the well. The Divine Couple disappeared after drinking two handfuls of water given by him. On coming out of the well with the third handful of water Ramanuja could not find his benefactors. Just then it was dawning and from the place be could see the Punyakoti Vimana of our Lord. He realised at once that his benefactors were no other than our Lord and his Consort and that he had reached the outskirts of Kanchi. This made him start this Tirta-kainkaryam. On page 65, the author writes, “Many of the reforms in the Temple set up and form of worship he introduced at Srirangam had their influence in this Temple as will be seen in latter chapters. In recognition of his great services, Ramanuja was deified in the Varadarajaswami Temple within fifty five years after his demise”. There is no evidence to support this contention. It is true that Ramanuja had special attraction for the Lord of our Temple. He does not appear to have introduced any reform in this Temple and hence there is no meaning in referring to them. On the other hand the fact that his disciples particularly Sri Nadadur Azhwan desired to have his image installed here and had it sanctified after his (Sri Ramanuja’s) demise is given in the Guruparampara. It is said 67 that Nadadur Azhwan took Sri Ramanuja’s permission for this, just before the latter’s demise. In the concluding portion of the ‘Introduction’ to this chapter, and under section 2 “Post Ramanuja period”, he deals with Ramanuja’s school of Vaishnavism. Here also he has started a most controversial theory of Sri Bashya or the northern school and Prabandic or southern school, implying a Vadakalai - Tenkalai cult2. The very terms are fallacious and contradictory, since both the Vadakalais and Tenkalais even now take pride in styling themselves as ‘Ubaya- Vedantins’, meaning that they swear by both Sri Bashyam and Bagavad-vishaya (Prabandas). It is only to misguide and confuse the uninformed and also the courts in the Tenkalai Vadakalai disputes, such theories were recently started by the ingenuity of the Tenkalai litigants. The Tenkalais claim themselves to belong to the southern cult or the Prabandic school (Tamil) and the Vadakalais, they say belong to the northern cult or Sri Bashya school (Sanskrit). By representing that they are pro-Tamils, they attempt to earn the sympathy and backing of the public of these parts who are all almost Tamilians. In the same way they try to mislead the courts also. A deeper study into the real significance of these two terms, will show the falsity of their claim. As said above both the sects revere Sri Satakopa (Nammalwar) and Sri Ramanuja (Bashyakar) and their works Divyaprabandas and Sri Bashya respectively. The author will be contradicting himself if he is going to say that the Vadakalais are more, if not ‘solely interested in Sri Bashya and Tenkalais in Bagavad- Vishaya, since the Tenkalais are equally vociferous in claiming to be the true followers of Sri Ramanuja (Emberumanar) the apostle of Visishtadvaita Siddanta. Specialising in a particular line of our Vaishnavite religion through certain scriptures by a person does not mean that the other scriptures are discarded by him or treated by him as against his cult. Sri Pillan, it was, upon whom the title of “Ubaya-Vedanta Simhasanadipati” was conferred by his Acharya Sri Ramanuja and adopted by him as his spiritual son. It is under the behests of the latter that Sri Pillan brought out the commentary, 68 “Arayirappadi”, the first gloss or interpretation of Tiruvaai- mozhi of Sri Nammalwar, otherwise called Bagavat-Vishaya. While directing Pillan to write a gloss on Tiruvaaimozhi, Ramanuja was influenced by the interest which Pillan evinced for this composition. Ramanuja also took into his consideration the fact that Pillan belonged to the family of Srimann Natamuni- kal. Yamuna too refers to Nammalwar as the Lord of his familys. It is but natural that Pillan should have been made the Chief for Ubaya-Vedanta. The Tatacharyas are the descen- dants of Pillan directly. So the bogey of two schools - Sri Bashya and Prabandic - northern and southern raised by the author has no basis, since they are not opposed to each other. The author himself concedes that there was no sectarian rancour even until and after Vedanta Desika’s time between the two schools and they are of recent origin,and “it is untenable to say that Vedanta Desika did not know the Tamil Prabandams”. The two schools, if schools they can be called, are not contra- dictory but complimentary to each other. They do not pres- cribe or teach the distinctions of Tenkalai - Vadakalai sampra- dayas or practices as we observe in these days. like the “tons- uring of widows”, sect marks etc. These two interpretations, not two schools, of Vedas and Prabandas are the two eyes of a true Vaishnavite. But the author for reasons best known to himself brings out here, his own theory that they are two different schools. He blows both hot and cold when he says that “even regarding the texts, the difference was one of preference. In fact, most of the followers of Rama- nuja like Embar, Battar, Kurukesa, Nanjiyar, Nampillai, Periya- vacchan Pillai, Pillailokacharya, Vedanta Desika and others were well versed in both Sanskrit and Tamil lore. In their works they struck a balance by adopting the manipravala style a free mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil words etc.” Striking a balance may mean, as though there is a difference between these two scriptures which are in Sanskrit and Tamil. The ‘manipravala’ is only a script apopted by our elders containing both Sanskrit and Tamil words. Loosely used, they create confusion. After saying that the above mentioned Acharyas were well versed in both, the author attributes that the differences and cleavages between the 69 two studies, started later. Here also we cannnt agree with the author. It is not the difference between the two studies but the difference between the the two sects viz the Tenkali and Vadakalai with regad to their ‘sampradayas’ or pratices. These differences are not taught by the ’two studies’. This concept of distinction, based on the study of Sri Bashya and Bagavat- Vishaya which the author tries to introduce, is fundamentally wrong. Such sophisticated theories to delude the ignorant and uninformed are of recent origin and there is no place for such distinctions in our Vaishnavism. Sri Bashya interprets the Vedas, in Sanskrit and Bagavad-Vishya in Tamil. The philoso- phy contained in both of them is the same. Are not the Ten- kalai temples have Vedas and Mantras (Sanskrit) in their rituals and vice-versa the Vadakalai temples the Prabandas (Tamil) ? Vedanta Desika asserts that there is no contradiction in the traditions followed by the pupils of the author of the Sri Bashya with reference to what these traditions mean. If at all there is any contradiction, it is only in the way of offering the purport by bringing together the words occurring in the passages in question. The ‘Sastras’ permit any difference that arises in the traditions due to place, time aud stages or conditions in life. If those ignorant of tradition choose to interpret according to their free will, then the defects belong only to those who speak of them 50. But in the litigations of the Tenkalai-Vadakalai disputes in our Temple and elsewhere, we may find instances of each beli- ttling the other in order to establish his own right as superior. To be more clear, the Tenkalais who are the office-holders of Adyapakam (Tamil Prabandas) in our Temple will assert that their service alone is very essential and that no other service even exists. On the other hand, the Vadakalais who are the Vedaparayana mirasdars will try to claim that their service alone is essential and the Prabandas are not necessary for the pujas or services in the Temple. Stranger still is the position with regard to the Temple at Tiruvahindrapuram in South Arcot District, which is purely a Vadakalai one. Here the dispute between the reciters of the Vedas and Prabandas are between Vedakalais . . 70 themselves, each trying to decry the other and rushing to courts, criminal and civil to establish their rights. By such ugly squa- bbles caused on account of purely selfish motives to gain certain preferences in the temples, we cannot take it that the Vedas and Prabandas are themselves contradictory and conflicting to each other. These are super-imposed by interested litigants and have nothing to do with our religion or philosophy. The remakrs at the end of Page 66 and the beginning of Page 67 that “Similarly, Kurukesa and Vedanta Desika of the so-called Vadakalai group wrote works in Tamil”, etc. are not happily worded. By such remarks the author betrays only his sectarian bigotry. He could have avoided such biased expressions like ’the so-called Vadakalai group’. In fine, a Tenkalai may be a great Sri Bashya Adikari and a Vadakalai, a Bagavat-Vishya Adikari (specialist) as and accor- ding to his personal propensity. Therefore, it is not necessary or desirable to advance arguments for or against the one or the other, in treatises like this, especially when our Acharyas have handed down them both to us as the most equally sacred. The author further harps and develops this theory on page 68 again. He says “the main doctrinal difference between these ’two schools, may be summed up here”. Thus stating, he points out certain differences. They are based on the differential approaches by the two sects while interpreting certain concepts and theories regarding God and His qualities. They are enumerated as eighteen in number&#34;. They have been there in the Vaishnava Sampradaya since the time of Periyavacchan Pillai. Pillai Lokacharya and Vedanta Desika noted some of them and offered their remarks, admitting the interpretations which they found admissible and rejecting others. It is certainly wrong to find a basis for the split of the Vaishnavasampradaya into Vadakalai and Tenkalai. Inspite of these differences in the doctrines, the sampradaya did never choose to exhibit mutual dislike or hatred. These differ- ences did not cause the split.71 The very names Vadakalai and Tenkalai came into the picture long after the period of Manavala Mamuni. Certain practices dopted by a section of people were held by them as the most sacred, deriving their authority from the conduct of pious people taken to be the strict followers of tradition. Others who took objection to these are taken to belong to the other section taking to such acts which are opposed to theirs. This much is the difference that marks out the two sects as belonging to rival groups particularly evincing interest in Temples, rituals there and exercise of their rights. The two sects swear, on the sampradaya level by the eighteen differences which are needless to get elaborated here. The present-day dispute between the two sects has no sanction on the side of religion and philosophy, but neither of them has stopped the spread of mutual ill will. To say that Tenkalais are more liberal in their outlook with regard to caste-system and the Vadakalais are rigid is also a travesty of truth. As already observed above, it is only a device to play to the gallery and earn the sympathy of law officers. Both the Tenkalais and Vadakalais have regard to Alwars, who were from diffierent castes. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Vadakalai Acharya, had chosen to claim Tiruppanalwar, a Harijan by birth, as Nampananathan (our Pananathan) 5b. He has even written a commentary on his (the Alwar’s) &#34; Amalanadipiran “, by name “Munivahana-Bogam”. Sri Desika also swears by the Prabandas of Alwars. The Tenkalais who claim to be the followers of Ramanuja could not find a single work of Sri Ramanuja in Tamil. Will they give him up because of this? All that was in Sanskrit originally viz the Vedas, Sutras, Upanishads, Gita etc., were reproduced as it were, in Tamil, by the Alwars. Later, our Acharyas reproduced them again in Sanskrit, according to the times and needs of the society towards its emancipation. Sidditrayam Geetartha Sangraham, Stotra- Ratnam and Chatussloki of Sri Alavandar, Sri Bashya, Geeta Bashya, Gatya Trayam etc., of Sri Ramanuja, Panchastavams by Sri Kurattalwar and the Stotras of Parasara Batta and other Acharyas like Sri Vedanta Desika in Sanskrit are all almost the interpretations of the Divyasuktis of Alwars, which in turn were the interpretations of the Vedas’. 72 We are really fed up with such distortions and misinter- pretations with regard to our great religion advanced both in the law courts and outside by this sect, adnauseam, to gain certain narrow ends, through their journals and other media. So let us proceed to Section 3 of this Chapter IV. The author concedes in the beginning of this section that the Vijayanagar Kings during the 16th century A. D. have extended their patronage on a lavish scale to the Vaishnava Acharyas and constructed the several mantapas, gopuras, vimanas etc., in the Sri Varadarajaswamy Temple. So far, so good. But in, so say- ing he wants to make it appear that one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar was the chief architect of these constructions. There are some inscriptions about this Jiyar. But nowwhere in these or any- where else it is said that he constructed the Kalyana Mantapa, the Rampart walls and the front Mantapa of the Tayar Shrine. There is also no mention of his connection with the Vijayanagar rulers either as a guru or adviser in these inscriptions. They simply mention some gifts by him to the Temple and in one of them as the Koil-Kelvi or Superintendent or Manager even. Excepting the author’s assertion, there is no other proof or basis that this Jiyar was the architect of all these construc- tions. On the other hand we have positive evidence of inscri- ptions, history and records to establish that the Tatacharyas who were the recognised royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar rulers, were alone responsible in securing the royal patronge for all these monumental works. This, the author himself accepts without naming the “Vaishnava-Acharyas” to whom they “extended their patronage “9. There are evidences in support of this10 Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika and his father Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika are admittedly, the spiritual preceptors or royal gurus of Kings Krishnaraya, Sadasiva Raya, Ramaraya, Sriranga and Venkata I “. These constructions took place during the times of these Kings only. viz 16th century A. D. The readers may draw their own conclusions from this. We are certainly one with the author in calling this period (16th century when these Kings were reigning) as “a golden age for Vaishnavism and Vijayanagar Kings “who oleration as evidenced by also for the Temple.” The despite their despite their general religious their charities to both Siva and 73 Vishnu Temples seem however in later times to have developed a special predilection to Vaishnavism and to have made the the Varadaraja temple an object of their special adoration” 12. The author next deels with the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420 to 1468 A. D., calling him as “the most prominent Jiyar at Kanchi in the post-Manavala Mamuni period”. But this Jiyar does not find a place in any of the inscriptions of our Temple. The T. T. D. inscriptions mention the activities of certain Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati. From this, the author without any connection or relevance starts saying abruptly that this Jiyar of the 15th century “seems to have held a similar position at Kanchi from the last decade of the 15th century”. But this Jiyar did not even see the last decade of the 15th century A.D. since even according to the author, this Jiyar did not live after 1468 A.D. The first two paragraphs of this section regarding the “Alagiya Manavala Jiyar” are most confusing and contradictory as can be seen from the way in which the author while describing one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar at Kanchi, suddenly turns to some other Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati and comes to describe again a different Jiyar of the same Math as having lived at Kanchi as the preceptor to one Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar. Further while speaking about the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420-1468 A.D. the author says that he (the Jiyar) is mentioned in &#34; several inscriptions datable to the latter balf of the 15th century and the earlier half of the 16th century”. Though the author freely speaks “of his services to the Temple and his eminent position in the Temple affairs of Kanchi”, he has not given any idea about the particulars of the inscriptions in which he is mentioned. We will have to be very guarded therefore, in giving them credence or taking them for granted without any reliable data or basis. As stated by us at the outset, to section 3 of this chapter, the Jiyar of the 16th century finds a place in some of the inscriptions. In those times when there was no such ill-feelings as we witness in these days between the Tenkalais and Vadakalais the management or supervision of the Temple works, worship and conduct of festivals were entrusted with and allotted to those who were 74 sincere and devoted without any distinction of sect or even caste. The Tatacharyas who were “the Manager-General of Temple Affairs” could not themselves attend to each and every item of the stupendous works they had started not only in our Temple but also in the other Temples at Kanchi and elsewhere. Naturally, this Jiyar who was a pious and sincere devotee might have been entrusted with ‘some of the works and services by them as an agent. In some of the inscriptions occur the names of such agents like Tirumalai Nambi Chakrarayarı3, Ramanujayyan of Tiruppullani’, Alagiyasingar17, Tiruppani Singarayyangar1, Emberumanar Aiyyan”, Tiruvengada Aiyangar17a, Viswa- pandita’s, Vaidyanatha Iyer18a, Jana Mudaliar, etc.186. It is learnt from these that in those times, “the several affairs of the Temple were assigned to different persons or bodies each in his or its time attended to the work for which he or it was nominated “”. Thus it is quite possible that Alagiya’ Manavala Jiyar was also entrusted with some of the works that were progressing under the aegis of the Tatacharyas as an agent which caused the mention of his name in some inscriptions. There are also similar inscriptions in our Temple about Ahobila swamis, Sankaracharyas, Madwacharyas and other pro- minent persons, mentioning about their gifts of villages and services to our Temple, during the same period (16th century A. D). Several other inscriptions describe the various offerings of devotees at different times!9a. These dignitaries who are equally, if not more prominent are not known to lay any such extravagant claims to the authorship of the major constructions in the Temple on the basis of their gifts or services in the 16th century A.D. The author gives an exaggerated account similarly with regard to the Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan20, Paravastu25, and Prativadi Bayankaram22 families on the basis of one or two inscriptions, he was able to delve from the ocean of inscriptions mentioning some gifts and services by them. Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan or Ayyangar was a disciple of Alagiya 75 Manavala Jiyar23. He was in charge of Ramanuja Kutams at Tirumalai, Kanchi and other places24. He was instrumental for the conduct of some festivals in several places including Kanchi25. But the author is not justified in exaggerating his contributions to our Temple. A report of the Archaeological Department26 describes these Vaishnavites in the following manner, who existed during the time of Achyutaraya. “Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar, Paravastunayanar and Vada Tiruvenkada Jiyar are some of the names occurring in the inscriptions of this King’s reign and the distinguishing prefixes of Kandadai and Paravastu are found among the family names of important Vaishnavite families, like the Tatacharyas of Conjeevaram”. The italics is by us to show, even then, they are compared with the prominent Tatacharya family. On page 82, the author gives an account of the Tatacharya family in his own way. He acknowledges that the Vijayanagar monarchs of the earlier period gave their high respects to the forefathers of the Tatacharyas. He next deals with Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya casually saying that “he lived in the court of Ramaraya “. He proceeds further to say that one branch of the Tatacharya family settled down at Kanchi during the time of Sriranga I (1572-1585 A. D.).. This statement is not correct. The Tatacharyas might have been visiting the courts of Vijayanagar Kings or even stayed there at times for longer periods. They might have been called with the prefixes of the names of places they had been staying, for the sake of distinguishing them from other local persons. But from a long time past their orginial homes were only Kanchi, Kumbakonam and Tirumalai“. Next the author’s comment (on page 83) that “the specific mention of Tatacharya’s agreement to perform the Janma- nakshatram of Manavala Mamuni on his annual birth day is indeed very significant as it shows his devotion to this acharya is very amusing. Without making any distinction, the great Tatacharya might have magnanimously and out of respect to a Vaishnavite devotee consented to do this. The author has been a bit careless in using the word devotion. Devotion is displayed generally to God, parents and Acharyas. It is not 76 shown indiscriminately to any Acharya but to one’s own and to the line of Acharyas who belong to him. Respect could have been a better word. It is needless to remark that a true Vaishnava should show his respect to everyone who is a Vaish- nava, whether he be a friend or a foe. Being an ardent Vaish- nava, how could he have refrained from showing his consider- ation to Manavalamamuni, a Vaishnavite Acharya? This occurr- ence should open the eyes of the warring members of both the sects as to the need to cultivate a healthy attitude on the lines taken up long ago by Sri Tatadesika. He had also contributed to the Vedapuriswarar Temple, when approached, liberally towards the construction of a mantapa, at Tirukkalikunram. This religious tolerance, benevolence and magnanimity should not be taken as devotion to that particular sect or religion, by the donor. We are led to believe the author has used the word ‘devotion’ here intentionally in order to derive a pleasure lacking in taste. On Page 84 of this Chapter IV, he says that because of the fall of Vijayanagar Kings, the family of “Ettur Kumara Tata- charya moved to Srirangapatna, the capital of the Mysore Kings, in the latter half of the 17th century in search of better for- tunes”. This is not only derogatory to the great family and its greater ancestor who were solely responsible for the construction of temples, endowing of properties towards the maintenance of Temples in general and our Temple in particular making of the several vehicles, ornaments and various other important necess- aries to our Temple, the philanthropic deeds like the construction of big lakes at Aiyangarkulam and Tenneri called “Tata- samudram “, the establishment of Agraharas (Villages) etc., but uncharitable and wrong to say that they migrated to Mysore “in search of better fortunes”. The fortune and wealth which the Tatacharyas acquired from out of their position, as the royal gurus (preceptors) to the Vijayanagar rulers for nearly three centuries would have sufficed to maintain several generations in royal splendour if they had but appropriated them for their own personal use. History, inscriptions and othor ancient works like Prapannamratam, Sadvamsa Guna Kirtanam, Maha Vamsa Mahimai etc., mention about the selfless services of the Tata- 77 charya family and their undying enthusiasm towards the uplift of the temples. That was the only goal and aim of life of that great Lakshmikumara Tatadesika his ancestors and his descen- dants. In order to make out an imaginary case for Tenkalai influence in the Temple at this period he has to avoid the pre- sence of the Tatacharyas and their influence at that period. To avoid this embarassing situation he has started on a theory on page 85 that the Stanatar who were managing the Temple affairs entrusted the management to Todarmal and that he in his turn gave it to his Acharya Attan Jiyar in the beginning of the 18th century. This is completely wrong. The Attan Jiyar agree- ment also will falsify this story. What was the necessity to enter into an agreement with a non-existent family! To get over this, the author starts with yet another story of &#34; The Return of the Tatacharya Family to Kanchi in 1711” on page 86. To say that one Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya returned to Kanchi from Mysore in 1711 A.D is yet another piece of the author’s inventive genius. As already observed there were several members of the family who had remained at Kanchi and the family of Sri Venkatavarada Tatacharya alone left for Mysore. The family of “Venkata Varada” had not also left Mysore once and for all in 1711. They remained there till the middle of the 19th century as the royal preceptors of the Kings of Mysore28 visiting Kanchi off and on. They wielded great influence by which they not only spread Sri Vaishnavism but also secured several large amounts of wealth to our Temple. So, both the stories of the family leaving entirely for Mysore in the later half of the 17th century and returning in the beginning of the 18th century, are, on the face of it, distortions 29. When the Jiyar was all in all, as the trustee, why should he enter into an agreement with persons who had lost all touch with the Temple? These are patent misrepresentations that can be easily observed by a discerning eye. Could anybody by any stretch of imagination, conceive of the family abandoning and leaving in lurch everything they had so devoutly built, fondly reared and cherished and maintained for the sake of “seeking better 99 78 ortunes as if they were in need of it. As the unquestioned and great “Acharyapurushas” of the day they were sought after by the kings of Mysore, the Nayak Chieftains of Tanjore and others. Simply because some of them had to go to different places for some time as spitirual preceptors, it cannot be said that the entire family had once for all left Kanchi bag and baggage. Most of the descendants were certainly staying behind, to look after the Temple and other interests, while only one family, viz., that of Venkata Varadacharya, the second son of Kotikannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika, left for the court of Devaraja Wodeyar at Srirangapatnam (Mysore). The remaining sons were certainly staying behind at Kanchi. This is testified even according to the author, by an inscription on page 84 of his Treatise. But in the same breath, the author builds a story that the Tatacharya families left in its entirety for Mysore” in search of better fortunes”, to suit his theory of the Stalattars managing the Temple and subsequenty transferring it to Todarmal during the last and the beginning of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. We have given a detailed historical version of the continuous interest. influence and management of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika before and after the fall of the Vijayanagar dynasty, in part I of this book, regarding our Temple. 99 The next item is “Attan Jiyar on page 85. The Tatacharyas, who secreted the Utsavar idols of Sri Varada and Nachiyars to Udayarpalayam on account of the fear of Muslim depradation, were said to have been reeling in agony and despair due to the separation. It was further, heightened when they were unable to restore them back, after the scare subsided, by the refusal of the Zamindar of Udayarpalayam to part with the Idols. Accidentally and fortunately just then, there was present at Kanchi, one Attan Jiyar, who was the guru of Todarmalla the Chieftain of a regiment. This Jiyar who was a Telugu Brahmin Sanyasin had come to Kanchi fleeing Golkonda after the killing of his relatives Akkanna and Madanna by the forces of Aurangazeb 29a. The Tatacharyas approached this Jiyar for help in restoring the idols through his disciple Todarmalla. The 79 Jiyar readily agreed and made his disciple act. Todarmalla accordingly went to the Zamin with his regiment and forced the zamindar to part with the idols. Having thus secured back the images, the Tatacharyas were prepared to give anything to Attan Jiyar for this great help. But as a true Sanyasin he only desired that the Tanian or Sloka in praise of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni, “Sri Sailesa Dayapatram” should be allowed to be recited before the commencement of the recital of Prabandas in the Temple. To this, the Tatacharyas readily agreed. This consent has been given by an agreement called “Attan Jiyar Agreement” not an undertaking as Dr. K. V. Raman would name it. What more? They have even allowed him to run the affairs of the Temple itself, in their ecstatic moment. Thus leaving almost everything in his hands in good faith, they started going on tours of &#34; tours of “Sishyarjana” periodically. The judicial decisions in the second half of the 19th century will establish that Attan Jiyar and the scions of his family were running the administration of the Temple on behalf of the Tata- charyas until 1792, when one Rama Rao, the last of the Attan Jiyar family was dismissed by the then Collector for misbe- haviour. One Srinivasaragavachari a grand son by daughter of Tatacharya was appointed by the Government in 1794 to manage the affairs, as a deputy to Tatacharyas. Even this person’s term was terminated in 1796 and the Government took over the management under their direct control which lasted till 1842 when it was restored back to the Tatacharyas as the “original mirasdars” (“Church-Wardens’) of the Temple30. Still more fantastic, is the story that they were given this priority of honours by their undertaking to honour the Tenkalai traditions (mamul) of the Temple, as if there was such a tradi- tion. When a person is honoured on account of his worthiness nobody will take an undertaking from him. The author states here (Page 86 and 89) that this agreement or “undertaking” is the famous agreement known as Attan Jiyar Agreement and this “was signed by Ettur Immadi Lakshmikumara Tatacharya and delivered to Attan Jiyar”. This is not correct since “Sri Lakshmikumara Tatacharya” was not in the picture in 1711 A.D. 80 He lived between 1572 to 1632 A. D. One Lakshmikumara Tirumalai Tatacharya and some others were the signatories to it. This “Ettur Tirumalai Lakshmikumara” is an appella- tion and not a name by itself, and is prefixed to all the names of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika. Secondly, the presumption itself is wrong. As said above the Attan Jiyar had no such right or position’ to confer the right of Agratambulam on Tatacharyas. It was the Tatacharyas, on the other hand who conceded to Attan Jiyar his request to recite, the Tanian of his Acharya as a return for his help in restoring back the idols. The history of the Tatacharyas in connection with the Temple and the influence they wielded as the spiritual preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs are all narrated in glowing terms by the chroniclers of history and the inscriptions found in several temples of South India. From at least the 15th Century A. D., these Acharya Purushas of an exalted line of the Vaishnavite hierarchs, prescribed the mode of worship and ri uals to be observed in the Temple, as the Srikaryams of the Temple affairs. While so, the author’s story on Page 86 of his book that Attan Jiyar, a newcomer in 1710 A. D. to Kanchi conferred the Agratambulam honours on the Tatacharyas after taking an undertaking from them that they would honour the Tenkalai tradition and mode of worship in the Temple, to say the least, is ridiculous. “The Tatacharyas connected with this Temple were very orthodox in the observance of religious rites and rituals to their meticulous prefection as precribed in the scriptures. The same system of observance has been handed down to their posterity and is still observed&#34;3’. Still more strange is author’s conclusion that because of some Arulappadu honours conferred on one Nallanchakravarthy of Srirangam who was a Tenkalai in 1713 A. D, “the Tenkalai preponderance in the temple is confirmed”, “What has this to do with the Tenkalai preponderance in the Temple ? Sri Sankara- charya, Sri Madvacharya and many other devotees were given privileges and honours in the Temple in lieu of their services to the Temple in the past. The Ahobilamath “Jivars &#34; who are ardent Vadakalais are also honoured on certain occasions and honours and emoluments are even now sent with the TempleIC U U AVA U 244 U Some of the Temple Paraphernalia (P. 81) Sri Vishwaksenar (P. 113) Dwarapalakas at the Azhakiyasingar Vasal (III Entrance) (P. 81) Dwarapalakas on the Hastigiri (IV Entrance to the Garbagraham) பெருமாள்கோவில்ஸ்லம் (வீடகலை)-5 U (P. 81) Inscription “Perumal Koil Stalam-Vadamalai” on the Prakara of Hastigiri (P. 122) Sita, Rama &amp; Lakshmana (Mulavars &amp; Utsavars) with Hanuman (P. 81) D ல், சி Entrance View of the Mirror Room (P. 81) 81 paraphernalia on three occasions in the year even today, in memory of their past services. These cannot therefore indicate the predominance of any particular sect. The only criterion is the sect-mark worn by the Cheif Deity (Mulavar) and other, important deities of Gods enshrined in the Temple, like Sri Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, Varaha, Ranganatha, Karu- manicka Varada, Danvantrin, the Parijanas like Ananta, Garuda Vishwaksena, Dwarapalakas, Hanumans, Sudarsanalwar etc., the Paraphernalia, Vahanas, Utensils Curtains, Fans, Pillows etc. In this Temple all these have only Vadakalai marks. The first Tirtakars are admittedly the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The Archaka Paricharakas who officiate in the pujas are all Vadakalais. The Vadakalai marks are carved, embossed, painted and displayed all over the fabric of the Temple boldly in places like Gopuras, Prakaras, Vimanas, Walls and Entrances. Many of them are stone cut namams (See Illustra- tions.) These are definitely indicative of the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. But the author vainly puts up attempts to make out a case otherwise. The author wants us to understand that the Tenkalai mode of ceremonies and worship prevailed in the Temple by citing some documents32 connected with the litigation of the Temple. What are the modes of Tenkalai worship and what are what are the Tenkalai ceremonies we fail to understand, despite the author’s parrot- like assertions without clarity or truth. Strictly speaking there can be no Tenkalai or Vadakalai mode of worship in a Temple. The worship is performed according to the Agamas which are neither Tenkalai nor Vadakalai. But we generally call a temple Vadakalai or Tenkalai on the basis of sectarian marks and those who officiate in the pujas. Even on this basis our Temple is definitely Vadakalai, as aforesaid. If the temple’s character is to be determined on the basis of service holders, the majority of the services like Vedaparayanam, Puranam reading, Stotra- patam, Mantrapushpam etc., are in the hands of the Vadakalais. The Tenkalais have only the Adyapakam service in which the Vadakalais also participate. The author’s case fails here also. 82 The author’s next item of the subject matter in this Chapter IV is &#34; Vaishnava-Sect-Marks”. The author makes out a very big case for the preponderant Tenkalai sect marks in the Temple. These marks which the author delves from the ocean of Vadakalai marks in the Temple are comparable to a mouse and a mountain. As detailed above the innumerable Vadakalai marks all over the fabric of the Temple in the most prominent and important places, starting from the Chief Deity bear eloquent testimony to the Vadakalai character and pre- dominance in the Temple. The so-called Tenkalai marks do not belong to the Vijayanagar period as alleged by the author. The Vijayanagar Kings were all Vadakalai Vaishnavaites and disciples of the Tatacharyas33. They would not have allowed or caused the Tenkalai marks to be displayed. The insignificant marks were surreptitiously introduced during the latter half of the 18th century by the scions of Attan Jiyar family when they had a free hand in running the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the leading Tatacharyas who tours of Sishyartanas. When these tamperings were noticed on their return, the Tatacharyas tried to wrest the management from Rama Rao the last scion of the family of the Jiyar. This man resisted and refused to hand over back the charge of the Temple to the Tatacharyas. Thereupon the Tatacharyas who were then popularly called the ‘Brahmins’ by the authorities approached the Collector for removing him. The Collector finding Mr. Rama Rao, guilty of gross insubordination dismissed him in 1792 and appointed one Srinivasaragavachari to manage the Temple as a deputy of the Tatacharyas. It will be interesting to note the observation of Mr. Balfour, the Collector, in this regard on 7th May, 1792. He says, “as far as I am enabled to judge from the different conversation I have had with Brahmins’ and others regarding the disputants’ claims to the Church-wardenship, I am led to believe the ancestors of those men whose names, I now enclose, were the original Church-Wardens and that the ancestors of Mr. Rama Rao were put in by the former as their Gumastha or Manager.” The names forwarded by the Collector were those 83 of the ancestors of the respondents, Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya Sri Viraragava Tatacharya and Sri Gopala Tatacharya, in a suit filed by one Appoo Row claiming Darmakartaship as the descendant of Attan Jiyar, in O. S. 5 of 1844 in the Jillah Court of Chingleput. The suit was dismissed and an appeal was preferred in the Court of Suddar Udalut in A. S. No. 29 of 1849. The appeal was also dismissed. The Jillah Judge while dismissing the suit of Appoo Row observes as follows: the whole it appears to the Civil Judge firstly that the Plaintiff has no right or title to the office of Darmakartha, some of his ancestors having officiated only as Gumasthas, secondly that the Defendants’ ancestors, Tatachari having been in 1794 declared to be the rightful mirasdar by competent authority while also the Plaintiff or his father failed to institute proceedings within 12 years after the establishment of the Jillah Court, the Plaintiff’s claim even if he had shown a better one, than he has done would be barred by both sections 10 and 18, Regulation II of 1802.” The Court of the Suddar Udalut in dismissing the appeal observes as follows: “From 1792 upto the present time the right and title of the appellant to the privilege he now lays claim to, has never been recognised. Whereas during the same period the members of the family of the respondents have been considered the lawful warden of the pagoda in question. In 1792 a violent dispute arose between two sects of Brahmins the Tenkalai and Vadakalai fomented entirely by the misconduct of one Rama Rao the Gumastha of the original mirasdar which ended in the disgrace of Rama Rao who was declared by the Government forever disqualified for the office of Church-warden and prevented from any future interference with the Church or any of its ceremony. It is through the connection this person then had with the pagoda, that the appellant now chiefly rests his claim to the office of Dharmakartha. “All the authorities therefore for the last 57 years have had one opinion of the claims of the respondent’s family to the office he now holds, and on what grounds the appellants rests his hopes to dislodge them and obtain the appointment for himself, the Court fails to discover. The appellant’s exhibits 84 prove nothing in his favour whereas those of the respondents and the public records show most distinctly that their ancestors have always been considered and acknowledged to be the original mirasdars of the institution” A further appeal to the highest Court was also of no avail. 66 From the foregoing extracts it will be clearly seen that the few Tenkalai namams seen lurking in some insignificant places in the Temple represent the work of those who had opportunities to introduce them stealthily during the latter half of the 18th century. On the basis of such insignificant features of Tenkalai marks the author tries to make out that the Temple is a Tenkalai one. Another important factor that will belie the author’s assertion, in this regard, on Pages 85 and 89, can be noted while going through the report to the Government of Madras Archaeological Department.34 While describing the slab Bearing an inscription on both sides (639 of 1919) and embellished at its top with the Tenkalai Vaishnavite mark flanked on either side by a conch and a discus”, the report says in para 64 that “it is also one of the 12 items within the temple which bear this mark as distinguished from Vada- kalai which is the recognised mark of the TEMPLE and the God therein”. The italics is by us to show the indisputable nature or character of the Temple as Vadakalai. What else is required to show the utter uselessness and falsity of the claim of the author in this regard? We shall have occasion still further to prove the hollowness of this assertion in a later context. To recapitulate, the Tenkalai namams which the author mentioned both in writing and through photos carefully avoiding the Vadakalai namams, are the creations of the period when the Attan Jiyar’s heirs were looking after the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the prominent Tatacharya proprietors of the Temple during the second half of the 18th century. But even in these photos many Vadakalai marks appear. In the concluding portion of this chapter the author once again repeats about the ’two schools’ and says that the Tenkalais who belong to the Prabandic school are more liberal in their outlook towards the caste system and the Vadakalais are 85 conservative. In what manner they were more liberal is the question. The Tenkalai Brahmins who claim to be liberal do not even allow the non-brahmin devotees who are well-versed in the Prabandas to join them in the recitation in their goshtis in the temples which are places of public worship not to speak of their disinclination to receive the prasadams in their company but yet they proclaim their catholicity vociferously, just to delude the uninformed, as already stated. And on this claim of their liberal outlook, the author says that “the vast majority of the temples of South India came under the spell of the eclectic Tenkalai school including the Varadarajaswamy Temple.” Absurdity can go no further. The author goes on repeating the same version of the Tenkalai predominance to the end by bringing forward the names of certain Jiyars and Tenkalai Tirtakars and the insignificant Tenkalai namams found in the Temple. We can only say that a lie cannot become a truth by repeating it several times. We have already pinpointed the fact that our Temple from the very ancient times has been only Vadakalai and continues to be so. We will have occasion to prove the Vadakalai character of the Temple during the course of this treatise in the succeeding chapters also with still more materials and force. Before concluding this chapter it may be relevant to relate some more instances which will clinch the issue and establish the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Acharya of the Vadakalai sect, has certain unique and special honours and privileges in the Temple which no other Alwar or Acharya has. On his birthday, the annual Tirunakshatram day of Purattasi-Sravanam-his deities enshrined both at Tuppul (a place about two miles from the Temple where his Avatara or birth took place) and in the Temple are the recipients of exclusive and extraordinary honours. The celebration of the daylong Mangalasasanam festival to Sri Tuppul Desika and the usual Sattumurai festival to the Temple Desika after that, are the two tell-tale evidence of the Vadakalai character of the Temple. Sri Andal’s “Feast” at Sri Desika’s shrine on the Bogi Tiru-Kalyanam day with Alankara Tirumanjanam (Holy bath) Astanam, etc. from morning to evening may also be added to the list. (See also Appendix-D for full details). 86 In four instances, the author reveals that he did rely upon what others had told him. Among these, one is Appillar’s writing a commentary on the Sri Bashya (Page 70) which is, a news not heard of before by any Vaishnava scholars. The second (Page 71) is Krishna Misra’s defeat at the hands of Vedanta Desika. It is true that Mahacharya’s Vedanta Desika Vaibava Prakasika35 mentions this incident. This is not borne out by the periods when the two scholars flourished. Krishna Misra lived in the first half of the eleventh century while Vedanta Desika, two and a half centuries later. The third instance is his mentioning the admirer who wrote the Acharya. Champu without reference to his name (Page 72). The author of this work was Kousika Vedantacharya son of Venkatacharya36. So, the Acharyachampu and the Vaibava Prakasika do not contain anything like an acceptable and valid treatment for some of the incidents in Sri Desika’s life. It is not proper to dis- miss the statement found in the Vadakalai Guruparampara, for this may be taken to be directed against those who are jealous of Vedanta Desika’s eminence. Where is the evidence to take the Tenkalais as meant here ? It is also not correct to state that “the Tenkalai school in- stalled his image in almost all the Temples under their control and celebrated festivals for him”. First of all, as we had occa- sion to controvert the notion of Tenkalai (Prabandic) and Vadakalai (Sri Bashya) schools elsewhere in this book, there is no such division of schools during his time. It is very doubtful whether the Temples which the author claims to belong to his school were originally Tenkalai at all. On the other hand, it can very well be inferred that the Temples in which Sri Desika’s Deity is found installed should have been originally Vadakalai. It is also noteworthy that even the Temples of the so-called “Tenkalai School” of the present day are having the Desika’s idols with Vadakali mark only with one or two unfortunate exceptions. But even these one or two are of very recent conversion. PART II-CHAPTER IV FOOT NOTES">

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="CHAPTER-IV THE ROLE OF THE TEMPLE IN THE GROWTH OF VAISHNAVISM In the ‘Introduction’ as well as on page 88 of the concluding portion of this chapter the author maintains that our Temple was ’not prominent in the beginning’. He bases this stand on the absence of any reference to Sri Varada, by the early Alwars, Poigai and Peyalwars, though admitting at the same breath that Budatalwar - one of the early Alwars has sung in praise of Him as ‘Attiyuran’. This is strange logic indeed! His stand is that ‘Vehka’ (The Yatoktakarin Temple) ‘was the most prominent’ Vishnu Temple at Kanchi in the beginning by virtue of its having been sung by Poigai and Peyalwars. But we would like to point out that the origin of the Lord at ‘Vehka’ was necessitated in order to prevent- the ‘Vegavati’ which was rushing to destroy the ‘Yaga’ performed by Brahma, before whom, it is said in the Puranas, Sri Mahavishnu emerged in all His effulgence as Lord Varada1 It is highly difficult to determine the priority or otherwise of one temple to another. The songs made by an Alwar about a temple or their absence cannot by themselves determine the ancient character of a temple. With our limited know- ledge and insight into the past occurrences, we fail thoroughly to settle this issue. It is prudent to admit that almost all the temples were there since very earliest times but they had their structures built at various times by the different rulers. The temples at Madurantakam, Srimushnam Pandarpur, Puri (Jagannath) and other places were not taken note of by the Alwars. Which of these temples was more ancient than the other ? The author need not have entered into such unnecessary theories and discussions of questions of prominence, ancient or modern, about these two allied Temples. 66 On page 62 he says that Tirukkacchinambi &#34; asked him to bring daily a jarful of water from a well, known as ‘sala-well for the worship at the Varadaraja temple which Ramanuja faithfully carried out&#34;. This is not in consonance with the tradition found in the Guruparampara and the version of Vatukanambi a close and trusted disciple of Ramanuja. They say that Ramanuja started doing this service (Kainkaryam) on and from the time of his safe return to Kanchi after escaping from the plot hatched by his Advaitic Teacher Yadavaprakasa to kill him. It is said that our Lord and his Consort Perundevi Tayar guided him through the thick jungles to reach Kanchi in the guise of a hunter and huntress. At the place where the ‘sala-well’ is situated the hunter-couple feigned thirst and asked Ramanuja to fetch them water from the well. The Divine Couple disappeared after drinking two handfuls of water given by him. On coming out of the well with the third handful of water Ramanuja could not find his benefactors. Just then it was dawning and from the place be could see the Punyakoti Vimana of our Lord. He realised at once that his benefactors were no other than our Lord and his Consort and that he had reached the outskirts of Kanchi. This made him start this Tirta-kainkaryam. On page 65, the author writes, “Many of the reforms in the Temple set up and form of worship he introduced at Srirangam had their influence in this Temple as will be seen in latter chapters. In recognition of his great services, Ramanuja was deified in the Varadarajaswami Temple within fifty five years after his demise”. There is no evidence to support this contention. It is true that Ramanuja had special attraction for the Lord of our Temple. He does not appear to have introduced any reform in this Temple and hence there is no meaning in referring to them. On the other hand the fact that his disciples particularly Sri Nadadur Azhwan desired to have his image installed here and had it sanctified after his (Sri Ramanuja’s) demise is given in the Guruparampara. It is said 67 that Nadadur Azhwan took Sri Ramanuja’s permission for this, just before the latter’s demise. In the concluding portion of the ‘Introduction’ to this chapter, and under section 2 “Post Ramanuja period”, he deals with Ramanuja’s school of Vaishnavism. Here also he has started a most controversial theory of Sri Bashya or the northern school and Prabandic or southern school, implying a Vadakalai - Tenkalai cult2. The very terms are fallacious and contradictory, since both the Vadakalais and Tenkalais even now take pride in styling themselves as ‘Ubaya- Vedantins’, meaning that they swear by both Sri Bashyam and Bagavad-vishaya (Prabandas). It is only to misguide and confuse the uninformed and also the courts in the Tenkalai Vadakalai disputes, such theories were recently started by the ingenuity of the Tenkalai litigants. The Tenkalais claim themselves to belong to the southern cult or the Prabandic school (Tamil) and the Vadakalais, they say belong to the northern cult or Sri Bashya school (Sanskrit). By representing that they are pro-Tamils, they attempt to earn the sympathy and backing of the public of these parts who are all almost Tamilians. In the same way they try to mislead the courts also. A deeper study into the real significance of these two terms, will show the falsity of their claim. As said above both the sects revere Sri Satakopa (Nammalwar) and Sri Ramanuja (Bashyakar) and their works Divyaprabandas and Sri Bashya respectively. The author will be contradicting himself if he is going to say that the Vadakalais are more, if not ‘solely interested in Sri Bashya and Tenkalais in Bagavad- Vishaya, since the Tenkalais are equally vociferous in claiming to be the true followers of Sri Ramanuja (Emberumanar) the apostle of Visishtadvaita Siddanta. Specialising in a particular line of our Vaishnavite religion through certain scriptures by a person does not mean that the other scriptures are discarded by him or treated by him as against his cult. Sri Pillan, it was, upon whom the title of “Ubaya-Vedanta Simhasanadipati” was conferred by his Acharya Sri Ramanuja and adopted by him as his spiritual son. It is under the behests of the latter that Sri Pillan brought out the commentary, 68 “Arayirappadi”, the first gloss or interpretation of Tiruvaai- mozhi of Sri Nammalwar, otherwise called Bagavat-Vishaya. While directing Pillan to write a gloss on Tiruvaaimozhi, Ramanuja was influenced by the interest which Pillan evinced for this composition. Ramanuja also took into his consideration the fact that Pillan belonged to the family of Srimann Natamuni- kal. Yamuna too refers to Nammalwar as the Lord of his familys. It is but natural that Pillan should have been made the Chief for Ubaya-Vedanta. The Tatacharyas are the descen- dants of Pillan directly. So the bogey of two schools - Sri Bashya and Prabandic - northern and southern raised by the author has no basis, since they are not opposed to each other. The author himself concedes that there was no sectarian rancour even until and after Vedanta Desika’s time between the two schools and they are of recent origin,and “it is untenable to say that Vedanta Desika did not know the Tamil Prabandams”. The two schools, if schools they can be called, are not contra- dictory but complimentary to each other. They do not pres- cribe or teach the distinctions of Tenkalai - Vadakalai sampra- dayas or practices as we observe in these days. like the “tons- uring of widows”, sect marks etc. These two interpretations, not two schools, of Vedas and Prabandas are the two eyes of a true Vaishnavite. But the author for reasons best known to himself brings out here, his own theory that they are two different schools. He blows both hot and cold when he says that “even regarding the texts, the difference was one of preference. In fact, most of the followers of Rama- nuja like Embar, Battar, Kurukesa, Nanjiyar, Nampillai, Periya- vacchan Pillai, Pillailokacharya, Vedanta Desika and others were well versed in both Sanskrit and Tamil lore. In their works they struck a balance by adopting the manipravala style a free mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil words etc.” Striking a balance may mean, as though there is a difference between these two scriptures which are in Sanskrit and Tamil. The ‘manipravala’ is only a script apopted by our elders containing both Sanskrit and Tamil words. Loosely used, they create confusion. After saying that the above mentioned Acharyas were well versed in both, the author attributes that the differences and cleavages between the 69 two studies, started later. Here also we cannnt agree with the author. It is not the difference between the two studies but the difference between the the two sects viz the Tenkali and Vadakalai with regad to their ‘sampradayas’ or pratices. These differences are not taught by the ’two studies’. This concept of distinction, based on the study of Sri Bashya and Bagavat- Vishaya which the author tries to introduce, is fundamentally wrong. Such sophisticated theories to delude the ignorant and uninformed are of recent origin and there is no place for such distinctions in our Vaishnavism. Sri Bashya interprets the Vedas, in Sanskrit and Bagavad-Vishya in Tamil. The philoso- phy contained in both of them is the same. Are not the Ten- kalai temples have Vedas and Mantras (Sanskrit) in their rituals and vice-versa the Vadakalai temples the Prabandas (Tamil) ? Vedanta Desika asserts that there is no contradiction in the traditions followed by the pupils of the author of the Sri Bashya with reference to what these traditions mean. If at all there is any contradiction, it is only in the way of offering the purport by bringing together the words occurring in the passages in question. The ‘Sastras’ permit any difference that arises in the traditions due to place, time aud stages or conditions in life. If those ignorant of tradition choose to interpret according to their free will, then the defects belong only to those who speak of them 50. But in the litigations of the Tenkalai-Vadakalai disputes in our Temple and elsewhere, we may find instances of each beli- ttling the other in order to establish his own right as superior. To be more clear, the Tenkalais who are the office-holders of Adyapakam (Tamil Prabandas) in our Temple will assert that their service alone is very essential and that no other service even exists. On the other hand, the Vadakalais who are the Vedaparayana mirasdars will try to claim that their service alone is essential and the Prabandas are not necessary for the pujas or services in the Temple. Stranger still is the position with regard to the Temple at Tiruvahindrapuram in South Arcot District, which is purely a Vadakalai one. Here the dispute between the reciters of the Vedas and Prabandas are between Vedakalais . . 70 themselves, each trying to decry the other and rushing to courts, criminal and civil to establish their rights. By such ugly squa- bbles caused on account of purely selfish motives to gain certain preferences in the temples, we cannot take it that the Vedas and Prabandas are themselves contradictory and conflicting to each other. These are super-imposed by interested litigants and have nothing to do with our religion or philosophy. The remakrs at the end of Page 66 and the beginning of Page 67 that “Similarly, Kurukesa and Vedanta Desika of the so-called Vadakalai group wrote works in Tamil”, etc. are not happily worded. By such remarks the author betrays only his sectarian bigotry. He could have avoided such biased expressions like ’the so-called Vadakalai group’. In fine, a Tenkalai may be a great Sri Bashya Adikari and a Vadakalai, a Bagavat-Vishya Adikari (specialist) as and accor- ding to his personal propensity. Therefore, it is not necessary or desirable to advance arguments for or against the one or the other, in treatises like this, especially when our Acharyas have handed down them both to us as the most equally sacred. The author further harps and develops this theory on page 68 again. He says “the main doctrinal difference between these ’two schools, may be summed up here”. Thus stating, he points out certain differences. They are based on the differential approaches by the two sects while interpreting certain concepts and theories regarding God and His qualities. They are enumerated as eighteen in number&#34;. They have been there in the Vaishnava Sampradaya since the time of Periyavacchan Pillai. Pillai Lokacharya and Vedanta Desika noted some of them and offered their remarks, admitting the interpretations which they found admissible and rejecting others. It is certainly wrong to find a basis for the split of the Vaishnavasampradaya into Vadakalai and Tenkalai. Inspite of these differences in the doctrines, the sampradaya did never choose to exhibit mutual dislike or hatred. These differ- ences did not cause the split.71 The very names Vadakalai and Tenkalai came into the picture long after the period of Manavala Mamuni. Certain practices dopted by a section of people were held by them as the most sacred, deriving their authority from the conduct of pious people taken to be the strict followers of tradition. Others who took objection to these are taken to belong to the other section taking to such acts which are opposed to theirs. This much is the difference that marks out the two sects as belonging to rival groups particularly evincing interest in Temples, rituals there and exercise of their rights. The two sects swear, on the sampradaya level by the eighteen differences which are needless to get elaborated here. The present-day dispute between the two sects has no sanction on the side of religion and philosophy, but neither of them has stopped the spread of mutual ill will. To say that Tenkalais are more liberal in their outlook with regard to caste-system and the Vadakalais are rigid is also a travesty of truth. As already observed above, it is only a device to play to the gallery and earn the sympathy of law officers. Both the Tenkalais and Vadakalais have regard to Alwars, who were from diffierent castes. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Vadakalai Acharya, had chosen to claim Tiruppanalwar, a Harijan by birth, as Nampananathan (our Pananathan) 5b. He has even written a commentary on his (the Alwar’s) &#34; Amalanadipiran “, by name “Munivahana-Bogam”. Sri Desika also swears by the Prabandas of Alwars. The Tenkalais who claim to be the followers of Ramanuja could not find a single work of Sri Ramanuja in Tamil. Will they give him up because of this? All that was in Sanskrit originally viz the Vedas, Sutras, Upanishads, Gita etc., were reproduced as it were, in Tamil, by the Alwars. Later, our Acharyas reproduced them again in Sanskrit, according to the times and needs of the society towards its emancipation. Sidditrayam Geetartha Sangraham, Stotra- Ratnam and Chatussloki of Sri Alavandar, Sri Bashya, Geeta Bashya, Gatya Trayam etc., of Sri Ramanuja, Panchastavams by Sri Kurattalwar and the Stotras of Parasara Batta and other Acharyas like Sri Vedanta Desika in Sanskrit are all almost the interpretations of the Divyasuktis of Alwars, which in turn were the interpretations of the Vedas’. 72 We are really fed up with such distortions and misinter- pretations with regard to our great religion advanced both in the law courts and outside by this sect, adnauseam, to gain certain narrow ends, through their journals and other media. So let us proceed to Section 3 of this Chapter IV. The author concedes in the beginning of this section that the Vijayanagar Kings during the 16th century A. D. have extended their patronage on a lavish scale to the Vaishnava Acharyas and constructed the several mantapas, gopuras, vimanas etc., in the Sri Varadarajaswamy Temple. So far, so good. But in, so say- ing he wants to make it appear that one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar was the chief architect of these constructions. There are some inscriptions about this Jiyar. But nowwhere in these or any- where else it is said that he constructed the Kalyana Mantapa, the Rampart walls and the front Mantapa of the Tayar Shrine. There is also no mention of his connection with the Vijayanagar rulers either as a guru or adviser in these inscriptions. They simply mention some gifts by him to the Temple and in one of them as the Koil-Kelvi or Superintendent or Manager even. Excepting the author’s assertion, there is no other proof or basis that this Jiyar was the architect of all these construc- tions. On the other hand we have positive evidence of inscri- ptions, history and records to establish that the Tatacharyas who were the recognised royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar rulers, were alone responsible in securing the royal patronge for all these monumental works. This, the author himself accepts without naming the “Vaishnava-Acharyas” to whom they “extended their patronage “9. There are evidences in support of this10 Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika and his father Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika are admittedly, the spiritual preceptors or royal gurus of Kings Krishnaraya, Sadasiva Raya, Ramaraya, Sriranga and Venkata I “. These constructions took place during the times of these Kings only. viz 16th century A. D. The readers may draw their own conclusions from this. We are certainly one with the author in calling this period (16th century when these Kings were reigning) as “a golden age for Vaishnavism and Vijayanagar Kings “who oleration as evidenced by also for the Temple.” The despite their despite their general religious their charities to both Siva and 73 Vishnu Temples seem however in later times to have developed a special predilection to Vaishnavism and to have made the the Varadaraja temple an object of their special adoration” 12. The author next deels with the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420 to 1468 A. D., calling him as “the most prominent Jiyar at Kanchi in the post-Manavala Mamuni period”. But this Jiyar does not find a place in any of the inscriptions of our Temple. The T. T. D. inscriptions mention the activities of certain Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati. From this, the author without any connection or relevance starts saying abruptly that this Jiyar of the 15th century “seems to have held a similar position at Kanchi from the last decade of the 15th century”. But this Jiyar did not even see the last decade of the 15th century A.D. since even according to the author, this Jiyar did not live after 1468 A.D. The first two paragraphs of this section regarding the “Alagiya Manavala Jiyar” are most confusing and contradictory as can be seen from the way in which the author while describing one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar at Kanchi, suddenly turns to some other Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati and comes to describe again a different Jiyar of the same Math as having lived at Kanchi as the preceptor to one Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar. Further while speaking about the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420-1468 A.D. the author says that he (the Jiyar) is mentioned in &#34; several inscriptions datable to the latter balf of the 15th century and the earlier half of the 16th century”. Though the author freely speaks “of his services to the Temple and his eminent position in the Temple affairs of Kanchi”, he has not given any idea about the particulars of the inscriptions in which he is mentioned. We will have to be very guarded therefore, in giving them credence or taking them for granted without any reliable data or basis. As stated by us at the outset, to section 3 of this chapter, the Jiyar of the 16th century finds a place in some of the inscriptions. In those times when there was no such ill-feelings as we witness in these days between the Tenkalais and Vadakalais the management or supervision of the Temple works, worship and conduct of festivals were entrusted with and allotted to those who were 74 sincere and devoted without any distinction of sect or even caste. The Tatacharyas who were “the Manager-General of Temple Affairs” could not themselves attend to each and every item of the stupendous works they had started not only in our Temple but also in the other Temples at Kanchi and elsewhere. Naturally, this Jiyar who was a pious and sincere devotee might have been entrusted with ‘some of the works and services by them as an agent. In some of the inscriptions occur the names of such agents like Tirumalai Nambi Chakrarayarı3, Ramanujayyan of Tiruppullani’, Alagiyasingar17, Tiruppani Singarayyangar1, Emberumanar Aiyyan”, Tiruvengada Aiyangar17a, Viswa- pandita’s, Vaidyanatha Iyer18a, Jana Mudaliar, etc.186. It is learnt from these that in those times, “the several affairs of the Temple were assigned to different persons or bodies each in his or its time attended to the work for which he or it was nominated “”. Thus it is quite possible that Alagiya’ Manavala Jiyar was also entrusted with some of the works that were progressing under the aegis of the Tatacharyas as an agent which caused the mention of his name in some inscriptions. There are also similar inscriptions in our Temple about Ahobila swamis, Sankaracharyas, Madwacharyas and other pro- minent persons, mentioning about their gifts of villages and services to our Temple, during the same period (16th century A. D). Several other inscriptions describe the various offerings of devotees at different times!9a. These dignitaries who are equally, if not more prominent are not known to lay any such extravagant claims to the authorship of the major constructions in the Temple on the basis of their gifts or services in the 16th century A.D. The author gives an exaggerated account similarly with regard to the Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan20, Paravastu25, and Prativadi Bayankaram22 families on the basis of one or two inscriptions, he was able to delve from the ocean of inscriptions mentioning some gifts and services by them. Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan or Ayyangar was a disciple of Alagiya 75 Manavala Jiyar23. He was in charge of Ramanuja Kutams at Tirumalai, Kanchi and other places24. He was instrumental for the conduct of some festivals in several places including Kanchi25. But the author is not justified in exaggerating his contributions to our Temple. A report of the Archaeological Department26 describes these Vaishnavites in the following manner, who existed during the time of Achyutaraya. “Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar, Paravastunayanar and Vada Tiruvenkada Jiyar are some of the names occurring in the inscriptions of this King’s reign and the distinguishing prefixes of Kandadai and Paravastu are found among the family names of important Vaishnavite families, like the Tatacharyas of Conjeevaram”. The italics is by us to show, even then, they are compared with the prominent Tatacharya family. On page 82, the author gives an account of the Tatacharya family in his own way. He acknowledges that the Vijayanagar monarchs of the earlier period gave their high respects to the forefathers of the Tatacharyas. He next deals with Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya casually saying that “he lived in the court of Ramaraya “. He proceeds further to say that one branch of the Tatacharya family settled down at Kanchi during the time of Sriranga I (1572-1585 A. D.).. This statement is not correct. The Tatacharyas might have been visiting the courts of Vijayanagar Kings or even stayed there at times for longer periods. They might have been called with the prefixes of the names of places they had been staying, for the sake of distinguishing them from other local persons. But from a long time past their orginial homes were only Kanchi, Kumbakonam and Tirumalai“. Next the author’s comment (on page 83) that “the specific mention of Tatacharya’s agreement to perform the Janma- nakshatram of Manavala Mamuni on his annual birth day is indeed very significant as it shows his devotion to this acharya is very amusing. Without making any distinction, the great Tatacharya might have magnanimously and out of respect to a Vaishnavite devotee consented to do this. The author has been a bit careless in using the word devotion. Devotion is displayed generally to God, parents and Acharyas. It is not 76 shown indiscriminately to any Acharya but to one’s own and to the line of Acharyas who belong to him. Respect could have been a better word. It is needless to remark that a true Vaishnava should show his respect to everyone who is a Vaish- nava, whether he be a friend or a foe. Being an ardent Vaish- nava, how could he have refrained from showing his consider- ation to Manavalamamuni, a Vaishnavite Acharya? This occurr- ence should open the eyes of the warring members of both the sects as to the need to cultivate a healthy attitude on the lines taken up long ago by Sri Tatadesika. He had also contributed to the Vedapuriswarar Temple, when approached, liberally towards the construction of a mantapa, at Tirukkalikunram. This religious tolerance, benevolence and magnanimity should not be taken as devotion to that particular sect or religion, by the donor. We are led to believe the author has used the word ‘devotion’ here intentionally in order to derive a pleasure lacking in taste. On Page 84 of this Chapter IV, he says that because of the fall of Vijayanagar Kings, the family of “Ettur Kumara Tata- charya moved to Srirangapatna, the capital of the Mysore Kings, in the latter half of the 17th century in search of better for- tunes”. This is not only derogatory to the great family and its greater ancestor who were solely responsible for the construction of temples, endowing of properties towards the maintenance of Temples in general and our Temple in particular making of the several vehicles, ornaments and various other important necess- aries to our Temple, the philanthropic deeds like the construction of big lakes at Aiyangarkulam and Tenneri called “Tata- samudram “, the establishment of Agraharas (Villages) etc., but uncharitable and wrong to say that they migrated to Mysore “in search of better fortunes”. The fortune and wealth which the Tatacharyas acquired from out of their position, as the royal gurus (preceptors) to the Vijayanagar rulers for nearly three centuries would have sufficed to maintain several generations in royal splendour if they had but appropriated them for their own personal use. History, inscriptions and othor ancient works like Prapannamratam, Sadvamsa Guna Kirtanam, Maha Vamsa Mahimai etc., mention about the selfless services of the Tata- 77 charya family and their undying enthusiasm towards the uplift of the temples. That was the only goal and aim of life of that great Lakshmikumara Tatadesika his ancestors and his descen- dants. In order to make out an imaginary case for Tenkalai influence in the Temple at this period he has to avoid the pre- sence of the Tatacharyas and their influence at that period. To avoid this embarassing situation he has started on a theory on page 85 that the Stanatar who were managing the Temple affairs entrusted the management to Todarmal and that he in his turn gave it to his Acharya Attan Jiyar in the beginning of the 18th century. This is completely wrong. The Attan Jiyar agree- ment also will falsify this story. What was the necessity to enter into an agreement with a non-existent family! To get over this, the author starts with yet another story of &#34; The Return of the Tatacharya Family to Kanchi in 1711” on page 86. To say that one Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya returned to Kanchi from Mysore in 1711 A.D is yet another piece of the author’s inventive genius. As already observed there were several members of the family who had remained at Kanchi and the family of Sri Venkatavarada Tatacharya alone left for Mysore. The family of “Venkata Varada” had not also left Mysore once and for all in 1711. They remained there till the middle of the 19th century as the royal preceptors of the Kings of Mysore28 visiting Kanchi off and on. They wielded great influence by which they not only spread Sri Vaishnavism but also secured several large amounts of wealth to our Temple. So, both the stories of the family leaving entirely for Mysore in the later half of the 17th century and returning in the beginning of the 18th century, are, on the face of it, distortions 29. When the Jiyar was all in all, as the trustee, why should he enter into an agreement with persons who had lost all touch with the Temple? These are patent misrepresentations that can be easily observed by a discerning eye. Could anybody by any stretch of imagination, conceive of the family abandoning and leaving in lurch everything they had so devoutly built, fondly reared and cherished and maintained for the sake of “seeking better 99 78 ortunes as if they were in need of it. As the unquestioned and great “Acharyapurushas” of the day they were sought after by the kings of Mysore, the Nayak Chieftains of Tanjore and others. Simply because some of them had to go to different places for some time as spitirual preceptors, it cannot be said that the entire family had once for all left Kanchi bag and baggage. Most of the descendants were certainly staying behind, to look after the Temple and other interests, while only one family, viz., that of Venkata Varadacharya, the second son of Kotikannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika, left for the court of Devaraja Wodeyar at Srirangapatnam (Mysore). The remaining sons were certainly staying behind at Kanchi. This is testified even according to the author, by an inscription on page 84 of his Treatise. But in the same breath, the author builds a story that the Tatacharya families left in its entirety for Mysore” in search of better fortunes”, to suit his theory of the Stalattars managing the Temple and subsequenty transferring it to Todarmal during the last and the beginning of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively. We have given a detailed historical version of the continuous interest. influence and management of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika before and after the fall of the Vijayanagar dynasty, in part I of this book, regarding our Temple. 99 The next item is “Attan Jiyar on page 85. The Tatacharyas, who secreted the Utsavar idols of Sri Varada and Nachiyars to Udayarpalayam on account of the fear of Muslim depradation, were said to have been reeling in agony and despair due to the separation. It was further, heightened when they were unable to restore them back, after the scare subsided, by the refusal of the Zamindar of Udayarpalayam to part with the Idols. Accidentally and fortunately just then, there was present at Kanchi, one Attan Jiyar, who was the guru of Todarmalla the Chieftain of a regiment. This Jiyar who was a Telugu Brahmin Sanyasin had come to Kanchi fleeing Golkonda after the killing of his relatives Akkanna and Madanna by the forces of Aurangazeb 29a. The Tatacharyas approached this Jiyar for help in restoring the idols through his disciple Todarmalla. The 79 Jiyar readily agreed and made his disciple act. Todarmalla accordingly went to the Zamin with his regiment and forced the zamindar to part with the idols. Having thus secured back the images, the Tatacharyas were prepared to give anything to Attan Jiyar for this great help. But as a true Sanyasin he only desired that the Tanian or Sloka in praise of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni, “Sri Sailesa Dayapatram” should be allowed to be recited before the commencement of the recital of Prabandas in the Temple. To this, the Tatacharyas readily agreed. This consent has been given by an agreement called “Attan Jiyar Agreement” not an undertaking as Dr. K. V. Raman would name it. What more? They have even allowed him to run the affairs of the Temple itself, in their ecstatic moment. Thus leaving almost everything in his hands in good faith, they started going on tours of &#34; tours of “Sishyarjana” periodically. The judicial decisions in the second half of the 19th century will establish that Attan Jiyar and the scions of his family were running the administration of the Temple on behalf of the Tata- charyas until 1792, when one Rama Rao, the last of the Attan Jiyar family was dismissed by the then Collector for misbe- haviour. One Srinivasaragavachari a grand son by daughter of Tatacharya was appointed by the Government in 1794 to manage the affairs, as a deputy to Tatacharyas. Even this person’s term was terminated in 1796 and the Government took over the management under their direct control which lasted till 1842 when it was restored back to the Tatacharyas as the “original mirasdars” (“Church-Wardens’) of the Temple30. Still more fantastic, is the story that they were given this priority of honours by their undertaking to honour the Tenkalai traditions (mamul) of the Temple, as if there was such a tradi- tion. When a person is honoured on account of his worthiness nobody will take an undertaking from him. The author states here (Page 86 and 89) that this agreement or “undertaking” is the famous agreement known as Attan Jiyar Agreement and this “was signed by Ettur Immadi Lakshmikumara Tatacharya and delivered to Attan Jiyar”. This is not correct since “Sri Lakshmikumara Tatacharya” was not in the picture in 1711 A.D. 80 He lived between 1572 to 1632 A. D. One Lakshmikumara Tirumalai Tatacharya and some others were the signatories to it. This “Ettur Tirumalai Lakshmikumara” is an appella- tion and not a name by itself, and is prefixed to all the names of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika. Secondly, the presumption itself is wrong. As said above the Attan Jiyar had no such right or position’ to confer the right of Agratambulam on Tatacharyas. It was the Tatacharyas, on the other hand who conceded to Attan Jiyar his request to recite, the Tanian of his Acharya as a return for his help in restoring back the idols. The history of the Tatacharyas in connection with the Temple and the influence they wielded as the spiritual preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs are all narrated in glowing terms by the chroniclers of history and the inscriptions found in several temples of South India. From at least the 15th Century A. D., these Acharya Purushas of an exalted line of the Vaishnavite hierarchs, prescribed the mode of worship and ri uals to be observed in the Temple, as the Srikaryams of the Temple affairs. While so, the author’s story on Page 86 of his book that Attan Jiyar, a newcomer in 1710 A. D. to Kanchi conferred the Agratambulam honours on the Tatacharyas after taking an undertaking from them that they would honour the Tenkalai tradition and mode of worship in the Temple, to say the least, is ridiculous. “The Tatacharyas connected with this Temple were very orthodox in the observance of religious rites and rituals to their meticulous prefection as precribed in the scriptures. The same system of observance has been handed down to their posterity and is still observed&#34;3’. Still more strange is author’s conclusion that because of some Arulappadu honours conferred on one Nallanchakravarthy of Srirangam who was a Tenkalai in 1713 A. D, “the Tenkalai preponderance in the temple is confirmed”, “What has this to do with the Tenkalai preponderance in the Temple ? Sri Sankara- charya, Sri Madvacharya and many other devotees were given privileges and honours in the Temple in lieu of their services to the Temple in the past. The Ahobilamath “Jivars &#34; who are ardent Vadakalais are also honoured on certain occasions and honours and emoluments are even now sent with the TempleIC U U AVA U 244 U Some of the Temple Paraphernalia (P. 81) Sri Vishwaksenar (P. 113) Dwarapalakas at the Azhakiyasingar Vasal (III Entrance) (P. 81) Dwarapalakas on the Hastigiri (IV Entrance to the Garbagraham) பெருமாள்கோவில்ஸ்லம் (வீடகலை)-5 U (P. 81) Inscription “Perumal Koil Stalam-Vadamalai” on the Prakara of Hastigiri (P. 122) Sita, Rama &amp; Lakshmana (Mulavars &amp; Utsavars) with Hanuman (P. 81) D ல், சி Entrance View of the Mirror Room (P. 81) 81 paraphernalia on three occasions in the year even today, in memory of their past services. These cannot therefore indicate the predominance of any particular sect. The only criterion is the sect-mark worn by the Cheif Deity (Mulavar) and other, important deities of Gods enshrined in the Temple, like Sri Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, Varaha, Ranganatha, Karu- manicka Varada, Danvantrin, the Parijanas like Ananta, Garuda Vishwaksena, Dwarapalakas, Hanumans, Sudarsanalwar etc., the Paraphernalia, Vahanas, Utensils Curtains, Fans, Pillows etc. In this Temple all these have only Vadakalai marks. The first Tirtakars are admittedly the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The Archaka Paricharakas who officiate in the pujas are all Vadakalais. The Vadakalai marks are carved, embossed, painted and displayed all over the fabric of the Temple boldly in places like Gopuras, Prakaras, Vimanas, Walls and Entrances. Many of them are stone cut namams (See Illustra- tions.) These are definitely indicative of the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. But the author vainly puts up attempts to make out a case otherwise. The author wants us to understand that the Tenkalai mode of ceremonies and worship prevailed in the Temple by citing some documents32 connected with the litigation of the Temple. What are the modes of Tenkalai worship and what are what are the Tenkalai ceremonies we fail to understand, despite the author’s parrot- like assertions without clarity or truth. Strictly speaking there can be no Tenkalai or Vadakalai mode of worship in a Temple. The worship is performed according to the Agamas which are neither Tenkalai nor Vadakalai. But we generally call a temple Vadakalai or Tenkalai on the basis of sectarian marks and those who officiate in the pujas. Even on this basis our Temple is definitely Vadakalai, as aforesaid. If the temple’s character is to be determined on the basis of service holders, the majority of the services like Vedaparayanam, Puranam reading, Stotra- patam, Mantrapushpam etc., are in the hands of the Vadakalais. The Tenkalais have only the Adyapakam service in which the Vadakalais also participate. The author’s case fails here also. 82 The author’s next item of the subject matter in this Chapter IV is &#34; Vaishnava-Sect-Marks”. The author makes out a very big case for the preponderant Tenkalai sect marks in the Temple. These marks which the author delves from the ocean of Vadakalai marks in the Temple are comparable to a mouse and a mountain. As detailed above the innumerable Vadakalai marks all over the fabric of the Temple in the most prominent and important places, starting from the Chief Deity bear eloquent testimony to the Vadakalai character and pre- dominance in the Temple. The so-called Tenkalai marks do not belong to the Vijayanagar period as alleged by the author. The Vijayanagar Kings were all Vadakalai Vaishnavaites and disciples of the Tatacharyas33. They would not have allowed or caused the Tenkalai marks to be displayed. The insignificant marks were surreptitiously introduced during the latter half of the 18th century by the scions of Attan Jiyar family when they had a free hand in running the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the leading Tatacharyas who tours of Sishyartanas. When these tamperings were noticed on their return, the Tatacharyas tried to wrest the management from Rama Rao the last scion of the family of the Jiyar. This man resisted and refused to hand over back the charge of the Temple to the Tatacharyas. Thereupon the Tatacharyas who were then popularly called the ‘Brahmins’ by the authorities approached the Collector for removing him. The Collector finding Mr. Rama Rao, guilty of gross insubordination dismissed him in 1792 and appointed one Srinivasaragavachari to manage the Temple as a deputy of the Tatacharyas. It will be interesting to note the observation of Mr. Balfour, the Collector, in this regard on 7th May, 1792. He says, “as far as I am enabled to judge from the different conversation I have had with Brahmins’ and others regarding the disputants’ claims to the Church-wardenship, I am led to believe the ancestors of those men whose names, I now enclose, were the original Church-Wardens and that the ancestors of Mr. Rama Rao were put in by the former as their Gumastha or Manager.” The names forwarded by the Collector were those 83 of the ancestors of the respondents, Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya Sri Viraragava Tatacharya and Sri Gopala Tatacharya, in a suit filed by one Appoo Row claiming Darmakartaship as the descendant of Attan Jiyar, in O. S. 5 of 1844 in the Jillah Court of Chingleput. The suit was dismissed and an appeal was preferred in the Court of Suddar Udalut in A. S. No. 29 of 1849. The appeal was also dismissed. The Jillah Judge while dismissing the suit of Appoo Row observes as follows: the whole it appears to the Civil Judge firstly that the Plaintiff has no right or title to the office of Darmakartha, some of his ancestors having officiated only as Gumasthas, secondly that the Defendants’ ancestors, Tatachari having been in 1794 declared to be the rightful mirasdar by competent authority while also the Plaintiff or his father failed to institute proceedings within 12 years after the establishment of the Jillah Court, the Plaintiff’s claim even if he had shown a better one, than he has done would be barred by both sections 10 and 18, Regulation II of 1802.” The Court of the Suddar Udalut in dismissing the appeal observes as follows: “From 1792 upto the present time the right and title of the appellant to the privilege he now lays claim to, has never been recognised. Whereas during the same period the members of the family of the respondents have been considered the lawful warden of the pagoda in question. In 1792 a violent dispute arose between two sects of Brahmins the Tenkalai and Vadakalai fomented entirely by the misconduct of one Rama Rao the Gumastha of the original mirasdar which ended in the disgrace of Rama Rao who was declared by the Government forever disqualified for the office of Church-warden and prevented from any future interference with the Church or any of its ceremony. It is through the connection this person then had with the pagoda, that the appellant now chiefly rests his claim to the office of Dharmakartha. “All the authorities therefore for the last 57 years have had one opinion of the claims of the respondent’s family to the office he now holds, and on what grounds the appellants rests his hopes to dislodge them and obtain the appointment for himself, the Court fails to discover. The appellant’s exhibits 84 prove nothing in his favour whereas those of the respondents and the public records show most distinctly that their ancestors have always been considered and acknowledged to be the original mirasdars of the institution” A further appeal to the highest Court was also of no avail. 66 From the foregoing extracts it will be clearly seen that the few Tenkalai namams seen lurking in some insignificant places in the Temple represent the work of those who had opportunities to introduce them stealthily during the latter half of the 18th century. On the basis of such insignificant features of Tenkalai marks the author tries to make out that the Temple is a Tenkalai one. Another important factor that will belie the author’s assertion, in this regard, on Pages 85 and 89, can be noted while going through the report to the Government of Madras Archaeological Department.34 While describing the slab Bearing an inscription on both sides (639 of 1919) and embellished at its top with the Tenkalai Vaishnavite mark flanked on either side by a conch and a discus”, the report says in para 64 that “it is also one of the 12 items within the temple which bear this mark as distinguished from Vada- kalai which is the recognised mark of the TEMPLE and the God therein”. The italics is by us to show the indisputable nature or character of the Temple as Vadakalai. What else is required to show the utter uselessness and falsity of the claim of the author in this regard? We shall have occasion still further to prove the hollowness of this assertion in a later context. To recapitulate, the Tenkalai namams which the author mentioned both in writing and through photos carefully avoiding the Vadakalai namams, are the creations of the period when the Attan Jiyar’s heirs were looking after the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the prominent Tatacharya proprietors of the Temple during the second half of the 18th century. But even in these photos many Vadakalai marks appear. In the concluding portion of this chapter the author once again repeats about the ’two schools’ and says that the Tenkalais who belong to the Prabandic school are more liberal in their outlook towards the caste system and the Vadakalais are 85 conservative. In what manner they were more liberal is the question. The Tenkalai Brahmins who claim to be liberal do not even allow the non-brahmin devotees who are well-versed in the Prabandas to join them in the recitation in their goshtis in the temples which are places of public worship not to speak of their disinclination to receive the prasadams in their company but yet they proclaim their catholicity vociferously, just to delude the uninformed, as already stated. And on this claim of their liberal outlook, the author says that “the vast majority of the temples of South India came under the spell of the eclectic Tenkalai school including the Varadarajaswamy Temple.” Absurdity can go no further. The author goes on repeating the same version of the Tenkalai predominance to the end by bringing forward the names of certain Jiyars and Tenkalai Tirtakars and the insignificant Tenkalai namams found in the Temple. We can only say that a lie cannot become a truth by repeating it several times. We have already pinpointed the fact that our Temple from the very ancient times has been only Vadakalai and continues to be so. We will have occasion to prove the Vadakalai character of the Temple during the course of this treatise in the succeeding chapters also with still more materials and force. Before concluding this chapter it may be relevant to relate some more instances which will clinch the issue and establish the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Acharya of the Vadakalai sect, has certain unique and special honours and privileges in the Temple which no other Alwar or Acharya has. On his birthday, the annual Tirunakshatram day of Purattasi-Sravanam-his deities enshrined both at Tuppul (a place about two miles from the Temple where his Avatara or birth took place) and in the Temple are the recipients of exclusive and extraordinary honours. The celebration of the daylong Mangalasasanam festival to Sri Tuppul Desika and the usual Sattumurai festival to the Temple Desika after that, are the two tell-tale evidence of the Vadakalai character of the Temple. Sri Andal’s “Feast” at Sri Desika’s shrine on the Bogi Tiru-Kalyanam day with Alankara Tirumanjanam (Holy bath) Astanam, etc. from morning to evening may also be added to the list. (See also Appendix-D for full details). 86 In four instances, the author reveals that he did rely upon what others had told him. Among these, one is Appillar’s writing a commentary on the Sri Bashya (Page 70) which is, a news not heard of before by any Vaishnava scholars. The second (Page 71) is Krishna Misra’s defeat at the hands of Vedanta Desika. It is true that Mahacharya’s Vedanta Desika Vaibava Prakasika35 mentions this incident. This is not borne out by the periods when the two scholars flourished. Krishna Misra lived in the first half of the eleventh century while Vedanta Desika, two and a half centuries later. The third instance is his mentioning the admirer who wrote the Acharya. Champu without reference to his name (Page 72). The author of this work was Kousika Vedantacharya son of Venkatacharya36. So, the Acharyachampu and the Vaibava Prakasika do not contain anything like an acceptable and valid treatment for some of the incidents in Sri Desika’s life. It is not proper to dis- miss the statement found in the Vadakalai Guruparampara, for this may be taken to be directed against those who are jealous of Vedanta Desika’s eminence. Where is the evidence to take the Tenkalais as meant here ? It is also not correct to state that “the Tenkalai school in- stalled his image in almost all the Temples under their control and celebrated festivals for him”. First of all, as we had occa- sion to controvert the notion of Tenkalai (Prabandic) and Vadakalai (Sri Bashya) schools elsewhere in this book, there is no such division of schools during his time. It is very doubtful whether the Temples which the author claims to belong to his school were originally Tenkalai at all. On the other hand, it can very well be inferred that the Temples in which Sri Desika’s Deity is found installed should have been originally Vadakalai. It is also noteworthy that even the Temples of the so-called “Tenkalai School” of the present day are having the Desika’s idols with Vadakali mark only with one or two unfortunate exceptions. But even these one or two are of very recent conversion. PART II-CHAPTER IV FOOT NOTES">

  <h2 id="has-sung-in-praise-of-him-as-attiyuran-this-is-strange-logic-indeed">CHAPTER-IV
THE ROLE OF THE TEMPLE IN THE GROWTH OF VAISHNAVISM
In the &lsquo;Introduction&rsquo; as well as on page 88 of the concluding portion of this chapter the author maintains that our Temple was &rsquo;not prominent in the beginning&rsquo;. He bases this stand on the absence of any reference to Sri Varada, by the early Alwars, Poigai and Peyalwars, though admitting at the same breath that Budatalwar - one of the early Alwars
has sung in praise of Him as &lsquo;Attiyuran&rsquo;. This is strange logic indeed!</h2>
<h2 id="that-nadadur-azhwan-took-sri-ramanujas-permission-for-this-just-before-the-latters-demise">His stand is that &lsquo;Vehka&rsquo; (The Yatoktakarin Temple) &lsquo;was the most prominent&rsquo; Vishnu Temple at Kanchi in the beginning by virtue of its having been sung by Poigai and Peyalwars. But we would like to point out that the origin of the Lord at &lsquo;Vehka&rsquo; was necessitated in order to prevent- the &lsquo;Vegavati&rsquo; which was rushing to destroy the &lsquo;Yaga&rsquo; performed by Brahma, before whom, it is said in the Puranas, Sri Mahavishnu emerged in all His effulgence as Lord Varada1
It is highly difficult to determine the priority or otherwise of one temple to another. The songs made by an Alwar about a temple or their absence cannot by themselves determine the ancient character of a temple. With our limited know- ledge and insight into the past occurrences, we fail thoroughly to settle this issue. It is prudent to admit that almost all the temples were there since very earliest times but they had their structures built at various times by the different rulers. The temples at Madurantakam, Srimushnam Pandarpur, Puri (Jagannath) and other places were not taken note of by the Alwars. Which of these temples was more ancient than the other ?
The author need not have entered into such unnecessary theories and discussions of questions of prominence, ancient or modern, about these two allied Temples.

On page 62 he says that Tirukkacchinambi &quot; asked him to bring daily a jarful of water from a well, known as &lsquo;sala-well for the worship at the Varadaraja temple which Ramanuja faithfully carried out&quot;. This is not in consonance with the tradition found in the Guruparampara and the version of Vatukanambi a close and trusted disciple of Ramanuja. They say that Ramanuja started doing this service (Kainkaryam) on and from the time of his safe return to Kanchi after escaping from the plot hatched by his Advaitic Teacher Yadavaprakasa to kill him. It is said that our Lord and his Consort Perundevi Tayar guided him through the thick jungles to reach Kanchi in the guise of a hunter and huntress. At the place where the &lsquo;sala-well&rsquo; is situated the hunter-couple feigned thirst and asked Ramanuja to fetch them water from the well. The Divine Couple disappeared after drinking two handfuls of water given by him. On coming out of the well with the third handful of water Ramanuja could not find his benefactors. Just then it was dawning and from the place be could see the Punyakoti Vimana of our Lord. He realised at once that his benefactors were no other than our Lord and his Consort and that he had reached the outskirts of Kanchi. This made him start this
Tirta-kainkaryam.
On page 65, the author writes, &ldquo;Many of the reforms in the Temple set up and form of worship he introduced at Srirangam had their influence in this Temple as will be seen in latter chapters. In recognition of his great services, Ramanuja was deified in the Varadarajaswami Temple within fifty five years after his demise&rdquo;.
There is no evidence to support this contention. It is true that Ramanuja had special attraction for the Lord of our Temple. He does not appear to have introduced any reform in this Temple and hence there is no meaning in referring to them. On the other hand the fact that his disciples particularly Sri Nadadur Azhwan desired to have his image installed here and had it sanctified after his (Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s) demise is given in the Guruparampara. It is said
67
that Nadadur Azhwan took Sri Ramanuja&rsquo;s permission for this, just before the latter&rsquo;s demise.</h2>
<h2 id="arayirappadi-the-first-gloss-or-interpretation-of-tiruvaai--mozhi-of-sri-nammalwar-otherwise-called-bagavat-vishaya">In the concluding portion of the &lsquo;Introduction&rsquo; to this chapter, and under section 2 &ldquo;Post Ramanuja period&rdquo;, he deals with Ramanuja&rsquo;s school of Vaishnavism. Here also he has started a most controversial theory of Sri Bashya or the northern school and Prabandic or southern school, implying a Vadakalai - Tenkalai cult2. The very terms are fallacious and contradictory, since both the Vadakalais and Tenkalais even now take pride in styling themselves as &lsquo;Ubaya- Vedantins&rsquo;, meaning that they swear by both Sri Bashyam and Bagavad-vishaya (Prabandas). It is only to misguide and confuse the uninformed and also the courts in the Tenkalai Vadakalai disputes, such theories were recently started by the ingenuity of the Tenkalai litigants. The Tenkalais claim themselves to belong to the southern cult or the Prabandic school (Tamil) and the Vadakalais, they say belong to the northern cult or Sri Bashya school (Sanskrit). By representing that they are pro-Tamils, they attempt to earn the sympathy and backing of the public of these parts who are all almost Tamilians. In the same way they try to mislead the courts also. A deeper study into the real significance of these two terms, will show the falsity of their claim. As said above both the sects revere Sri Satakopa (Nammalwar) and Sri Ramanuja (Bashyakar) and their works Divyaprabandas and Sri Bashya respectively. The author will be contradicting himself if he is going to say that the Vadakalais are more, if not &lsquo;solely interested in Sri Bashya and Tenkalais in Bagavad- Vishaya, since the Tenkalais are equally vociferous in claiming to be the true followers of Sri Ramanuja (Emberumanar) the apostle of Visishtadvaita Siddanta. Specialising in a particular line of our Vaishnavite religion through certain scriptures by a person does not mean that the other scriptures are discarded by him or treated by him as against his cult.
Sri Pillan, it was, upon whom the title of &ldquo;Ubaya-Vedanta Simhasanadipati&rdquo; was conferred by his Acharya Sri Ramanuja and adopted by him as his spiritual son. It is under the behests of the latter that Sri Pillan brought out the commentary,
68
&ldquo;Arayirappadi&rdquo;, the first gloss or interpretation of Tiruvaai- mozhi of Sri Nammalwar, otherwise called Bagavat-Vishaya.</h2>
<p>While directing Pillan to write a gloss on Tiruvaaimozhi, Ramanuja was influenced by the interest which Pillan evinced for this composition. Ramanuja also took into his consideration the fact that Pillan belonged to the family of Srimann Natamuni- kal. Yamuna too refers to Nammalwar as the Lord of his familys. It is but natural that Pillan should have been made the Chief for Ubaya-Vedanta. The Tatacharyas are the descen- dants of Pillan directly. So the bogey of two schools - Sri Bashya and Prabandic - northern and southern raised by the author has no basis, since they are not opposed to each other. The author himself concedes that there was no sectarian rancour even until and after Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s time between the two schools and they are of recent origin,and &ldquo;it is untenable to say that Vedanta Desika did not know the Tamil Prabandams&rdquo;. The two schools, if schools they can be called, are not contra- dictory but complimentary to each other. They do not pres- cribe or teach the distinctions of Tenkalai - Vadakalai sampra- dayas or practices as we observe in these days. like the &ldquo;tons- uring of widows&rdquo;, sect marks etc.
These two interpretations, not two schools, of Vedas and Prabandas are the two eyes of a true Vaishnavite. But the author for reasons best known to himself brings out here, his own theory that they are two different schools. He blows both hot and cold when he says that &ldquo;even regarding the texts, the difference was one of preference. In fact, most of the followers of Rama- nuja like Embar, Battar, Kurukesa, Nanjiyar, Nampillai, Periya- vacchan Pillai, Pillailokacharya, Vedanta Desika and others were well versed in both Sanskrit and Tamil lore. In their works they struck a balance by adopting the manipravala style a free mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil words etc.&rdquo; Striking a balance may mean, as though there is a difference between these two scriptures which are in Sanskrit and Tamil. The &lsquo;manipravala&rsquo; is only a script apopted by our elders containing both Sanskrit and Tamil words. Loosely used, they create confusion. After saying that the above mentioned Acharyas were well versed in both, the author attributes that the differences and cleavages between the
69
two studies, started later. Here also we cannnt agree with the author. It is not the difference between the two studies but the difference between the the two sects viz the Tenkali and Vadakalai with regad to their &lsquo;sampradayas&rsquo; or pratices. These differences are not taught by the &rsquo;two studies&rsquo;. This concept of distinction, based on the study of Sri Bashya and Bagavat- Vishaya which the author tries to introduce, is fundamentally wrong. Such sophisticated theories to delude the ignorant and uninformed are of recent origin and there is no place for such distinctions in our Vaishnavism. Sri Bashya interprets the Vedas, in Sanskrit and Bagavad-Vishya in Tamil. The philoso- phy contained in both of them is the same. Are not the Ten- kalai temples have Vedas and Mantras (Sanskrit) in their rituals and vice-versa the Vadakalai temples the Prabandas (Tamil) ?
Vedanta Desika asserts that there is no contradiction in the traditions followed by the pupils of the author of the Sri Bashya with reference to what these traditions mean. If at all there is any contradiction, it is only in the way of offering the purport by bringing together the words occurring in the passages in question. The &lsquo;Sastras&rsquo; permit any difference that arises in the traditions due to place, time aud stages or conditions in life. If those ignorant of tradition choose to interpret according to their free will, then the defects belong only to those who speak of them 50.
But in the litigations of the Tenkalai-Vadakalai disputes in our Temple and elsewhere, we may find instances of each beli- ttling the other in order to establish his own right as superior. To be more clear, the Tenkalais who are the office-holders of Adyapakam (Tamil Prabandas) in our Temple will assert that their service alone is very essential and that no other service even exists. On the other hand, the Vadakalais who are the Vedaparayana mirasdars will try to claim that their service alone is essential and the Prabandas are not necessary for the pujas or services in the Temple. Stranger still is the position with regard to the Temple at Tiruvahindrapuram in South Arcot District, which is purely a Vadakalai one. Here the dispute between the reciters of the Vedas and Prabandas are between Vedakalais
.

70
themselves, each trying to decry the other and rushing to courts, criminal and civil to establish their rights. By such ugly squa- bbles caused on account of purely selfish motives to gain certain preferences in the temples, we cannot take it that the Vedas and Prabandas are themselves contradictory and conflicting to each other. These are super-imposed by interested litigants and have nothing to do with our religion or philosophy.
The remakrs at the end of Page 66 and the beginning of Page 67 that &ldquo;Similarly, Kurukesa and Vedanta Desika of the so-called Vadakalai group wrote works in Tamil&rdquo;, etc. are not happily worded. By such remarks the author betrays only his sectarian bigotry. He could have avoided such biased expressions like &rsquo;the so-called Vadakalai group&rsquo;.
In fine, a Tenkalai may be a great Sri Bashya Adikari and a Vadakalai, a Bagavat-Vishya Adikari (specialist) as and accor- ding to his personal propensity. Therefore, it is not necessary or desirable to advance arguments for or against the one or the other, in treatises like this, especially when our Acharyas have handed down them both to us as the most equally sacred.
The author further harps and develops this theory on page 68 again. He says &ldquo;the main doctrinal difference between these &rsquo;two schools, may be summed up here&rdquo;. Thus stating, he points out certain differences.
They are based on the differential approaches by the two sects while interpreting certain concepts and theories regarding God and His qualities. They are enumerated as eighteen in number&quot;. They have been there in the Vaishnava Sampradaya since the time of Periyavacchan Pillai. Pillai Lokacharya and Vedanta Desika noted some of them and offered their remarks, admitting the interpretations which they found admissible and rejecting others. It is certainly wrong to find a basis for the split of the Vaishnavasampradaya into Vadakalai and Tenkalai. Inspite of these differences in the doctrines, the sampradaya did never choose to exhibit mutual dislike or hatred. These differ- ences did not cause the split.71
The very names Vadakalai and Tenkalai came into the picture long after the period of Manavala Mamuni. Certain practices dopted by a section of people were held by them as the most sacred, deriving their authority from the conduct of pious people taken to be the strict followers of tradition. Others who took objection to these are taken to belong to the other section taking to such acts which are opposed to theirs. This much is the difference that marks out the two sects as belonging to rival groups particularly evincing interest in Temples, rituals there and exercise of their rights. The two sects swear, on the sampradaya level by the eighteen differences which are needless to get elaborated here. The present-day dispute between the two sects has no sanction on the side of religion and philosophy, but neither of them has stopped the spread of mutual ill will.
To say that Tenkalais are more liberal in their outlook with regard to caste-system and the Vadakalais are rigid is also a travesty of truth. As already observed above, it is only a device to play to the gallery and earn the sympathy of law officers. Both the Tenkalais and Vadakalais have regard to Alwars, who were from diffierent castes. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Vadakalai Acharya, had chosen to claim Tiruppanalwar, a Harijan by birth, as Nampananathan (our Pananathan) 5b. He has even written a commentary on his (the Alwar&rsquo;s) &quot; Amalanadipiran &ldquo;, by name &ldquo;Munivahana-Bogam&rdquo;. Sri Desika also swears by the Prabandas of Alwars. The Tenkalais who claim to be the followers of Ramanuja could not find a single work of Sri Ramanuja in Tamil. Will they give him up because of this? All that was in Sanskrit originally viz the Vedas, Sutras, Upanishads, Gita etc., were reproduced as it were, in Tamil, by the Alwars. Later, our Acharyas reproduced them again in Sanskrit, according to the times and needs of the society towards its emancipation. Sidditrayam Geetartha Sangraham, Stotra- Ratnam and Chatussloki of Sri Alavandar, Sri Bashya, Geeta Bashya, Gatya Trayam etc., of Sri Ramanuja, Panchastavams by Sri Kurattalwar and the Stotras of Parasara Batta and other Acharyas like Sri Vedanta Desika in Sanskrit are all almost the interpretations of the Divyasuktis of Alwars, which in turn were the interpretations of the Vedas&rsquo;.
72
We are really fed up with such distortions and misinter- pretations with regard to our great religion advanced both in the law courts and outside by this sect, adnauseam, to gain certain narrow ends, through their journals and other media. So let us proceed to Section 3 of this Chapter IV.
The author concedes in the beginning of this section that the Vijayanagar Kings during the 16th century A. D. have extended their patronage on a lavish scale to the Vaishnava Acharyas and constructed the several mantapas, gopuras, vimanas etc., in the Sri Varadarajaswamy Temple. So far, so good. But in, so say- ing he wants to make it appear that one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar was the chief architect of these constructions. There are some inscriptions about this Jiyar. But nowwhere in these or any- where else it is said that he constructed the Kalyana Mantapa, the Rampart walls and the front Mantapa of the Tayar Shrine. There is also no mention of his connection with the Vijayanagar rulers either as a guru or adviser in these inscriptions. They simply mention some gifts by him to the Temple and in one of them as the Koil-Kelvi or Superintendent or Manager even. Excepting the author&rsquo;s assertion, there is no other proof or basis that this Jiyar was the architect of all these construc- tions. On the other hand we have positive evidence of inscri- ptions, history and records to establish that the Tatacharyas who were the recognised royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar rulers, were alone responsible in securing the royal patronge for all these monumental works. This, the author himself accepts without naming the &ldquo;Vaishnava-Acharyas&rdquo; to whom they &ldquo;extended their patronage &ldquo;9. There are evidences in support of this10 Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika and his father Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika are admittedly, the spiritual preceptors or royal gurus of Kings Krishnaraya, Sadasiva Raya, Ramaraya, Sriranga and Venkata I &ldquo;. These constructions took place during the times of these Kings only. viz 16th century A. D. The readers may draw their own conclusions from this. We are certainly one with the author in calling this period (16th century when these Kings were reigning) as &ldquo;a golden age for Vaishnavism and Vijayanagar Kings &ldquo;who
oleration as evidenced by
also for the Temple.&rdquo; The despite their despite their general religious their charities to both Siva and
73
Vishnu Temples seem however in later times to have developed a special predilection to Vaishnavism and to have made the the Varadaraja temple an object of their special adoration&rdquo; 12.
The author next deels with the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420 to 1468 A. D., calling him as &ldquo;the most prominent Jiyar at Kanchi in the post-Manavala Mamuni period&rdquo;. But this Jiyar does not find a place in any of the inscriptions of our Temple. The T. T. D. inscriptions mention the activities of certain Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati. From this, the author without any connection or relevance starts saying abruptly that this Jiyar of the 15th century &ldquo;seems to have held a similar position at Kanchi from the last decade of the 15th century&rdquo;. But this Jiyar did not even see the last decade of the 15th century A.D. since even according to the author, this Jiyar did not live after 1468 A.D. The first two paragraphs of this section regarding the &ldquo;Alagiya Manavala Jiyar&rdquo; are most confusing and contradictory as can be seen from the way in which the author while describing one Alagiya Manavala Jiyar at Kanchi, suddenly turns to some other Jiyars at Srirangam and Tirupati and comes to describe again a different Jiyar of the same Math as having lived at Kanchi as the preceptor to one Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar.
Further while speaking about the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar who lived between 1420-1468 A.D. the author says that he (the Jiyar) is mentioned in &quot; several inscriptions datable to the latter balf of the 15th century and the earlier half of the 16th century&rdquo;. Though the author freely speaks &ldquo;of his services to the Temple and his eminent position in the Temple affairs of Kanchi&rdquo;, he has not given any idea about the particulars of the inscriptions in which he is mentioned. We will have to be very guarded therefore, in giving them credence or taking them for granted without any reliable data or basis. As stated by us at the outset, to section 3 of this chapter, the Jiyar of the 16th century finds a place in some of the inscriptions. In those times when there was no such ill-feelings as we witness in these days between the Tenkalais and Vadakalais the management or supervision of the Temple works, worship and conduct of festivals were entrusted with and allotted to those who were
74
sincere and devoted without any distinction of sect or even caste. The Tatacharyas who were &ldquo;the Manager-General of Temple Affairs&rdquo; could not themselves attend to each and every item of the stupendous works they had started not only in our Temple but also in the other Temples at Kanchi and elsewhere. Naturally, this Jiyar who was a pious and sincere devotee might have been entrusted with &lsquo;some of the works and services by them as an agent.
In some of the inscriptions occur the names of such agents like Tirumalai Nambi Chakrarayarı3, Ramanujayyan of Tiruppullani&rsquo;, Alagiyasingar17, Tiruppani Singarayyangar1, Emberumanar Aiyyan&rdquo;, Tiruvengada Aiyangar17a, Viswa- pandita&rsquo;s, Vaidyanatha Iyer18a, Jana Mudaliar, etc.186.
It is learnt from these that in those times, &ldquo;the several affairs of the Temple were assigned to different persons or bodies each in his or its time attended to the work for which he or it was nominated &ldquo;&rdquo;. Thus it is quite possible that Alagiya&rsquo; Manavala Jiyar was also entrusted with some of the works that were progressing under the aegis of the Tatacharyas as an agent which caused the mention of his name in some inscriptions.
There are also similar inscriptions in our Temple about Ahobila swamis, Sankaracharyas, Madwacharyas and other pro- minent persons, mentioning about their gifts of villages and services to our Temple, during the same period (16th century A. D). Several other inscriptions describe the various offerings of devotees at different times!9a. These dignitaries who are equally, if not more prominent are not known to lay any such extravagant claims to the authorship of the major constructions in the Temple on the basis of their gifts or services in the 16th century A.D.
The author gives an exaggerated account similarly with regard to the Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan20, Paravastu25, and Prativadi Bayankaram22 families on the basis of one or two inscriptions, he was able to delve from the ocean of inscriptions mentioning some gifts and services by them. Kandadai Ramanuja Ayyan or Ayyangar was a disciple of Alagiya
75
Manavala Jiyar23. He was in charge of Ramanuja Kutams at Tirumalai, Kanchi and other places24. He was instrumental for the conduct of some festivals in several places including Kanchi25. But the author is not justified in exaggerating his contributions to our Temple. A report of the Archaeological Department26 describes these Vaishnavites in the following manner, who existed during the time of Achyutaraya. &ldquo;Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar, Paravastunayanar and Vada Tiruvenkada Jiyar are some of the names occurring in the inscriptions of this King&rsquo;s reign and the distinguishing prefixes of Kandadai and Paravastu are found among the family names of important Vaishnavite families, like the Tatacharyas of Conjeevaram&rdquo;. The italics is by us to show, even then, they are compared with the prominent Tatacharya family.
On page 82, the author gives an account of the Tatacharya family in his own way. He acknowledges that the Vijayanagar monarchs of the earlier period gave their high respects to the forefathers of the Tatacharyas. He next deals with Panchamatabanjanam Tatacharya casually saying that &ldquo;he lived in the court of Ramaraya &ldquo;. He proceeds further to say that one branch of the Tatacharya family settled down at Kanchi during the time of Sriranga I (1572-1585 A. D.).. This statement is not correct. The Tatacharyas might have been visiting the courts of Vijayanagar Kings or even stayed there at times for longer periods. They might have been called with the prefixes of the names of places they had been staying, for the sake of distinguishing them from other local persons. But from a long time past their orginial homes were only Kanchi, Kumbakonam and Tirumalai“.
Next the author&rsquo;s comment (on page 83) that “the specific mention of Tatacharya&rsquo;s agreement to perform the Janma- nakshatram of Manavala Mamuni on his annual birth day is indeed very significant as it shows his devotion to this acharya is very amusing. Without making any distinction, the great Tatacharya might have magnanimously and out of respect to a Vaishnavite devotee consented to do this. The author has been a bit careless in using the word devotion. Devotion is displayed generally to God, parents and Acharyas. It is not
76
shown indiscriminately to any Acharya but to one&rsquo;s own and to the line of Acharyas who belong to him. Respect could have been a better word. It is needless to remark that a true Vaishnava should show his respect to everyone who is a Vaish- nava, whether he be a friend or a foe. Being an ardent Vaish- nava, how could he have refrained from showing his consider- ation to Manavalamamuni, a Vaishnavite Acharya? This occurr- ence should open the eyes of the warring members of both the sects as to the need to cultivate a healthy attitude on the lines taken up long ago by Sri Tatadesika. He had also contributed to the Vedapuriswarar Temple, when approached, liberally towards the construction of a mantapa, at Tirukkalikunram. This religious tolerance, benevolence and magnanimity should not be taken as devotion to that particular sect or religion, by the donor. We are led to believe the author has used the word &lsquo;devotion&rsquo; here intentionally in order to derive a pleasure lacking in taste.
On Page 84 of this Chapter IV, he says that because of the fall of Vijayanagar Kings, the family of &ldquo;Ettur Kumara Tata- charya moved to Srirangapatna, the capital of the Mysore Kings, in the latter half of the 17th century in search of better for- tunes&rdquo;. This is not only derogatory to the great family and its greater ancestor who were solely responsible for the construction of temples, endowing of properties towards the maintenance of Temples in general and our Temple in particular making of the several vehicles, ornaments and various other important necess- aries to our Temple, the philanthropic deeds like the construction of big lakes at Aiyangarkulam and Tenneri called &ldquo;Tata- samudram &ldquo;, the establishment of Agraharas (Villages) etc., but uncharitable and wrong to say that they migrated to Mysore &ldquo;in search of better fortunes&rdquo;. The fortune and wealth which the Tatacharyas acquired from out of their position, as the royal gurus (preceptors) to the Vijayanagar rulers for nearly three centuries would have sufficed to maintain several generations in royal splendour if they had but appropriated them for their own personal use. History, inscriptions and othor ancient works like Prapannamratam, Sadvamsa Guna Kirtanam, Maha Vamsa Mahimai etc., mention about the selfless services of the Tata-
77
charya family and their undying enthusiasm towards the uplift of the temples. That was the only goal and aim of life of that great Lakshmikumara Tatadesika his ancestors and his descen- dants. In order to make out an imaginary case for Tenkalai influence in the Temple at this period he has to avoid the pre- sence of the Tatacharyas and their influence at that period. To avoid this embarassing situation he has started on a theory on page 85 that the Stanatar who were managing the Temple affairs entrusted the management to Todarmal and that he in his turn gave it to his Acharya Attan Jiyar in the beginning of the 18th century. This is completely wrong. The Attan Jiyar agree- ment also will falsify this story. What was the necessity to enter into an agreement with a non-existent family! To get over this, the author starts with yet another story of &quot; The Return of the Tatacharya Family to Kanchi in 1711&rdquo; on page 86.
To say that one Ettur Tirumalai Kumara Tatacharya returned to Kanchi from Mysore in 1711 A.D is yet another piece of the author&rsquo;s inventive genius. As already observed there were several members of the family who had remained at Kanchi and the family of Sri Venkatavarada Tatacharya alone left for Mysore. The family of &ldquo;Venkata Varada&rdquo; had not also left Mysore once and for all in 1711. They remained there till the middle of the 19th century as the royal preceptors of the Kings of Mysore28 visiting Kanchi off and on. They wielded great influence by which they not only spread Sri Vaishnavism but also secured several large amounts of wealth to our Temple. So, both the stories of the family leaving entirely for Mysore in the later half of the 17th century and returning in the beginning of the 18th century, are, on the face of it, distortions 29. When the Jiyar was all in all, as the trustee, why should he enter into an agreement with persons who had lost all touch with the Temple? These are patent misrepresentations that can be easily observed by a discerning eye. Could anybody by any stretch of imagination, conceive of the family abandoning and leaving in lurch everything they had so devoutly built, fondly reared and cherished and maintained for the sake of &ldquo;seeking better
99
78
ortunes as if they were in need of it. As the unquestioned and great &ldquo;Acharyapurushas&rdquo; of the day they were sought after by the kings of Mysore, the Nayak Chieftains of Tanjore and others. Simply because some of them had to go to different places for some time as spitirual preceptors, it cannot be said that the entire family had once for all left Kanchi bag and baggage. Most of the descendants were certainly staying behind, to look after the Temple and other interests, while only one family, viz., that of Venkata Varadacharya, the second son of Kotikannikadanam Lakshmikumara Tatadesika, left for the court of Devaraja Wodeyar at Srirangapatnam (Mysore). The remaining sons were certainly staying behind at Kanchi. This is testified even according to the author, by an inscription on page 84 of his Treatise. But in the same breath, the author builds a story that the Tatacharya families left in its entirety for Mysore&rdquo; in search of better fortunes&rdquo;, to suit his theory of the Stalattars managing the Temple and subsequenty transferring it to Todarmal during the last and the beginning of the 17th and 18th centuries respectively.
We have given a detailed historical version of the continuous interest. influence and management of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika before and after the fall of the Vijayanagar dynasty, in part I of this book, regarding our Temple.
99
The next item is &ldquo;Attan Jiyar on page 85. The Tatacharyas, who secreted the Utsavar idols of Sri Varada and Nachiyars to Udayarpalayam on account of the fear of Muslim depradation, were said to have been reeling in agony and despair due to the separation. It was further, heightened when they were unable to restore them back, after the scare subsided, by the refusal of the Zamindar of Udayarpalayam to part with the Idols. Accidentally and fortunately just then, there was present at Kanchi, one Attan Jiyar, who was the guru of Todarmalla the Chieftain of a regiment. This Jiyar who was a Telugu Brahmin Sanyasin had come to Kanchi fleeing Golkonda after the killing of his relatives Akkanna and Madanna by the forces of Aurangazeb 29a. The Tatacharyas approached this Jiyar for help in restoring the idols through his disciple Todarmalla. The
79
Jiyar readily agreed and made his disciple act. Todarmalla accordingly went to the Zamin with his regiment and forced the zamindar to part with the idols. Having thus secured back the images, the Tatacharyas were prepared to give anything to Attan Jiyar for this great help. But as a true Sanyasin he only desired that the Tanian or Sloka in praise of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni, &ldquo;Sri Sailesa Dayapatram&rdquo; should be allowed to be recited before the commencement of the recital of Prabandas in the Temple. To this, the Tatacharyas readily agreed. This consent has been given by an agreement called &ldquo;Attan Jiyar Agreement&rdquo; not an undertaking as Dr. K. V. Raman would name it. What more? They have even allowed him to run the affairs of the Temple itself, in their ecstatic moment. Thus leaving almost everything in his hands in good faith, they started going on tours of &quot;
tours of &ldquo;Sishyarjana&rdquo;
periodically.
The judicial decisions in the second half of the 19th century will establish that Attan Jiyar and the scions of his family were running the administration of the Temple on behalf of the Tata- charyas until 1792, when one Rama Rao, the last of the Attan Jiyar family was dismissed by the then Collector for misbe- haviour. One Srinivasaragavachari a grand son by daughter of Tatacharya was appointed by the Government in 1794 to manage the affairs, as a deputy to Tatacharyas. Even this person&rsquo;s term was terminated in 1796 and the Government took over the management under their direct control which lasted till 1842 when it was restored back to the Tatacharyas as the &ldquo;original mirasdars&rdquo; (&ldquo;Church-Wardens&rsquo;) of the Temple30.
Still more fantastic, is the story that they were given this priority of honours by their undertaking to honour the Tenkalai traditions (mamul) of the Temple, as if there was such a tradi- tion. When a person is honoured on account of his worthiness nobody will take an undertaking from him. The author states here (Page 86 and 89) that this agreement or &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is the famous agreement known as Attan Jiyar Agreement and this &ldquo;was signed by Ettur Immadi Lakshmikumara Tatacharya and delivered to Attan Jiyar&rdquo;. This is not correct since &ldquo;Sri Lakshmikumara Tatacharya&rdquo; was not in the picture in 1711 A.D.
80
He lived between 1572 to 1632 A. D. One Lakshmikumara Tirumalai Tatacharya and some others were the signatories to it. This &ldquo;Ettur Tirumalai Lakshmikumara&rdquo; is an appella- tion and not a name by itself, and is prefixed to all the names of the descendants of Sri Lakshmikumara Tatadesika. Secondly, the presumption itself is wrong. As said above the Attan Jiyar had no such right or position&rsquo; to confer the right of Agratambulam on Tatacharyas. It was the Tatacharyas, on the other hand who conceded to Attan Jiyar his request to recite, the Tanian of his Acharya as a return for his help in restoring back the idols. The history of the Tatacharyas in connection with the Temple and the influence they wielded as the spiritual preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs are all narrated in glowing terms by the chroniclers of history and the inscriptions found in several temples of South India. From at least the 15th Century A. D., these Acharya Purushas of an exalted line of the Vaishnavite hierarchs, prescribed the mode of worship and ri uals to be observed in the Temple, as the Srikaryams of the Temple affairs. While so, the author&rsquo;s story on Page 86 of his book that Attan Jiyar, a newcomer in 1710 A. D. to Kanchi conferred the Agratambulam honours on the Tatacharyas after taking an undertaking from them that they would honour the Tenkalai tradition and mode of worship in the Temple, to say the least, is ridiculous. &ldquo;The Tatacharyas connected with this Temple were very orthodox in the observance of religious rites and rituals to their meticulous prefection as precribed in the scriptures. The same system of observance has been handed down to their posterity and is still observed&quot;3&rsquo;.
Still more strange is author&rsquo;s conclusion that because of some Arulappadu honours conferred on one Nallanchakravarthy of Srirangam who was a Tenkalai in 1713 A. D, &ldquo;the Tenkalai preponderance in the temple is confirmed&rdquo;, &ldquo;What has this to do with the Tenkalai preponderance in the Temple ? Sri Sankara- charya, Sri Madvacharya and many other devotees were given privileges and honours in the Temple in lieu of their services to the Temple in the past. The Ahobilamath &ldquo;Jivars &quot; who are ardent Vadakalais are also honoured on certain occasions and honours and emoluments are even now sent with the TempleIC

paraphernalia on three occasions in the year even today, in memory of their past services. These cannot therefore indicate the predominance of any particular sect. The only criterion is the sect-mark worn by the Cheif Deity (Mulavar) and other, important deities of Gods enshrined in the Temple, like Sri Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, Varaha, Ranganatha, Karu- manicka Varada, Danvantrin, the Parijanas like Ananta, Garuda Vishwaksena, Dwarapalakas, Hanumans, Sudarsanalwar etc., the Paraphernalia, Vahanas, Utensils Curtains, Fans, Pillows etc. In this Temple all these have only Vadakalai marks. The first Tirtakars are admittedly the Vadakalai Tatacharyas. The Archaka Paricharakas who officiate in the pujas are all Vadakalais. The Vadakalai marks are carved, embossed, painted and displayed all over the fabric of the Temple boldly in places like Gopuras, Prakaras, Vimanas, Walls and Entrances. Many of them are stone cut namams (See Illustra- tions.) These are definitely indicative of the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. But the author vainly puts up attempts to make out a case otherwise. The author wants us to understand that the Tenkalai mode of ceremonies and worship prevailed in the Temple by citing some documents32 connected with the litigation of the Temple. What are the modes of Tenkalai worship and what are
what are the Tenkalai ceremonies we fail to understand, despite the author&rsquo;s parrot- like assertions without clarity or truth. Strictly speaking there can be no Tenkalai or Vadakalai mode of worship in a Temple. The worship is performed according to the Agamas which are neither Tenkalai nor Vadakalai. But we generally call a temple Vadakalai or Tenkalai on the basis of sectarian marks and those who officiate in the pujas. Even on this basis our Temple is definitely Vadakalai, as aforesaid. If the temple&rsquo;s character is to be determined on the basis of service holders, the majority of the services like Vedaparayanam, Puranam reading, Stotra- patam, Mantrapushpam etc., are in the hands of the Vadakalais. The Tenkalais have only the Adyapakam service in which the Vadakalais also participate. The author&rsquo;s case fails here also.
82
The author&rsquo;s next item of the subject matter in this Chapter IV is &quot; Vaishnava-Sect-Marks&rdquo;. The author makes out a very big case for the preponderant Tenkalai sect marks in the Temple. These marks which the author delves from the ocean of Vadakalai marks in the Temple are comparable to a mouse and a mountain. As detailed above the innumerable Vadakalai marks all over the fabric of the Temple in the most prominent and important places, starting from the Chief Deity bear eloquent testimony to the Vadakalai character
and pre- dominance in the Temple. The so-called Tenkalai marks do not belong to the Vijayanagar period as alleged by the author. The Vijayanagar Kings were all Vadakalai Vaishnavaites and disciples of the Tatacharyas33. They would not have allowed or caused the Tenkalai marks to be displayed. The insignificant marks were surreptitiously introduced during the latter half of the 18th century by the scions of Attan Jiyar family when they had a free hand in running the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the leading Tatacharyas who tours of Sishyartanas. When these tamperings were noticed on their return, the Tatacharyas tried to wrest the management from Rama Rao the last scion of the family of the Jiyar. This man resisted and refused to hand over back the charge of the Temple to the Tatacharyas. Thereupon the Tatacharyas who were then popularly called the &lsquo;Brahmins&rsquo; by the authorities approached the Collector for removing him. The Collector finding Mr. Rama Rao, guilty of gross insubordination dismissed him in 1792 and appointed one Srinivasaragavachari to manage the Temple as a deputy of the Tatacharyas.
It will be interesting to note the observation of Mr. Balfour, the Collector, in this regard on 7th May, 1792. He says, &ldquo;as far as I am enabled to judge from the different conversation I have had with Brahmins&rsquo; and others regarding the disputants&rsquo; claims to the Church-wardenship, I am led to believe the ancestors of those men whose names, I now enclose, were the original Church-Wardens and that the ancestors of Mr. Rama Rao were put in by the former as their Gumastha or Manager.&rdquo; The names forwarded by the Collector were those
83
of the ancestors of the respondents, Sri Sudarsana Tatacharya Sri Viraragava Tatacharya and Sri Gopala Tatacharya, in a suit filed by one Appoo Row claiming Darmakartaship as the descendant of Attan Jiyar, in O. S. 5 of 1844 in the Jillah Court of Chingleput. The suit was dismissed and an appeal was preferred in the Court of Suddar Udalut in A. S. No. 29 of 1849. The appeal was also dismissed. The Jillah Judge while dismissing the suit of Appoo Row observes as follows: the whole it appears to the Civil Judge firstly that the Plaintiff has no right or title to the office of Darmakartha, some of his ancestors having officiated only as Gumasthas, secondly that the Defendants&rsquo; ancestors, Tatachari having been in 1794 declared to be the rightful mirasdar by competent authority while also the Plaintiff or his father failed to institute proceedings within 12 years after the establishment of the Jillah Court, the Plaintiff&rsquo;s claim even if he had shown a better one, than he has done would be barred by both sections 10 and 18, Regulation II of 1802.&rdquo;
The Court of the Suddar Udalut in dismissing the appeal observes as follows: &ldquo;From 1792 upto the present time the right and title of the appellant to the privilege he now lays claim to, has never been recognised. Whereas during the same period the members of the family of the respondents have been considered the lawful warden of the pagoda in question. In 1792 a violent dispute arose between two sects of Brahmins the Tenkalai and Vadakalai fomented entirely by the misconduct of one Rama Rao the Gumastha of the original mirasdar which ended in the disgrace of Rama Rao who was declared by the Government forever disqualified for the office of Church-warden and prevented from any future interference with the Church or any of its ceremony. It is through the connection this person then had with the pagoda, that the appellant now chiefly rests his claim to the office of Dharmakartha.
&ldquo;All the authorities therefore for the last 57 years have had one opinion of the claims of the respondent&rsquo;s family to the office he now holds, and on what grounds the appellants rests his hopes to dislodge them and obtain the appointment for himself, the Court fails to discover. The appellant&rsquo;s exhibits
84
prove nothing in his favour whereas those of the respondents and the public records show most distinctly that their ancestors have always been considered and acknowledged to be the original mirasdars of the institution&rdquo; A further appeal to the highest Court was also of no avail.
66
From the foregoing extracts it will be clearly seen that the few Tenkalai namams seen lurking in some insignificant places in the Temple represent the work of those who had opportunities to introduce them stealthily during the latter half of the 18th century. On the basis of such insignificant features of Tenkalai marks the author tries to make out that the Temple is a Tenkalai one. Another important factor that will belie the author&rsquo;s assertion, in this regard, on Pages 85 and 89, can be noted while going through the report to the Government of Madras Archaeological Department.34 While describing the slab Bearing an inscription on both sides (639 of 1919) and embellished at its top with the Tenkalai Vaishnavite mark flanked on either side by a conch and a discus&rdquo;, the report says in para 64 that &ldquo;it is also one of the 12 items within the temple which bear this mark as distinguished from Vada- kalai which is the recognised mark of the TEMPLE and the God therein&rdquo;. The italics is by us to show the indisputable nature or character of the Temple as Vadakalai. What else is required to show the utter uselessness and falsity of the claim of the author in this regard? We shall have occasion still further to prove the hollowness of this assertion in a later context. To recapitulate, the Tenkalai namams which the author mentioned both in writing and through photos carefully avoiding the Vadakalai namams, are the creations of the period when the Attan Jiyar&rsquo;s heirs were looking after the affairs of the Temple in the absence of the prominent Tatacharya proprietors of the Temple during the second half of the 18th century. But even in these photos many Vadakalai marks appear.
In the concluding portion of this chapter the author once again repeats about the &rsquo;two schools&rsquo; and says that the Tenkalais who belong to the Prabandic school are more liberal in their outlook towards the caste system and the Vadakalais are
85
conservative. In what manner they were more liberal is the question. The Tenkalai Brahmins who claim to be liberal do not even allow the non-brahmin devotees who are well-versed in the Prabandas to join them in the recitation in their goshtis in the temples which are places of public worship not to speak of their disinclination to receive the prasadams in their company but yet they proclaim their catholicity vociferously, just to delude the uninformed, as already stated. And on this claim of their liberal outlook, the author says that &ldquo;the vast majority of the temples of South India came under the spell of the eclectic Tenkalai school including the Varadarajaswamy Temple.&rdquo; Absurdity can go no further. The author goes on repeating the same version of the Tenkalai predominance to the end by bringing forward the names of certain Jiyars and Tenkalai Tirtakars and the insignificant Tenkalai namams found in the Temple. We can only say that a lie cannot become a truth by repeating it several times. We have already pinpointed the fact that our Temple from the very ancient times has been only Vadakalai and continues to be so. We will have occasion to prove the Vadakalai character of the Temple during the course of this treatise in the succeeding chapters also with still more materials and force. Before concluding this chapter it may be relevant to relate some more instances which will clinch the issue and establish the Vadakalai predominance in the Temple. Sri Vedanta Desika, the great Acharya of the Vadakalai sect, has certain unique and special honours and privileges in the Temple which no other Alwar or Acharya has. On his birthday, the annual Tirunakshatram day of Purattasi-Sravanam-his deities enshrined both at Tuppul (a place about two miles from the Temple where his Avatara or birth took place) and in the Temple are the recipients of exclusive and extraordinary honours. The celebration of the daylong Mangalasasanam festival to Sri Tuppul Desika and the usual Sattumurai festival to the Temple Desika after that, are the two tell-tale evidence of the Vadakalai character of the Temple. Sri Andal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feast&rdquo; at Sri Desika&rsquo;s shrine on the Bogi Tiru-Kalyanam day with Alankara Tirumanjanam (Holy bath) Astanam, etc. from morning to evening may also be added to the list. (See also Appendix-D for full details).
86
In four instances, the author reveals that he did rely upon what others had told him. Among these, one is Appillar&rsquo;s writing a commentary on the Sri Bashya (Page 70) which is, a news not heard of before by any Vaishnava scholars. The second (Page 71) is Krishna Misra&rsquo;s defeat at the hands of Vedanta Desika. It is true that Mahacharya&rsquo;s Vedanta Desika Vaibava Prakasika35 mentions this incident. This is not borne out by the periods when the two scholars flourished. Krishna Misra lived in the first half of the eleventh century while Vedanta Desika, two and a half centuries later. The third instance is his mentioning the admirer who wrote the Acharya. Champu without reference to his name (Page 72). The author of this work was Kousika Vedantacharya son of Venkatacharya36. So, the Acharyachampu and the Vaibava Prakasika do not contain anything like an acceptable and valid treatment for some of the incidents in Sri Desika&rsquo;s life. It is not proper to dis- miss the statement found in the Vadakalai Guruparampara, for this may be taken to be directed against those who are jealous of Vedanta Desika&rsquo;s eminence. Where is the evidence to take
the Tenkalais as meant here ?
It is also not correct to state that &ldquo;the Tenkalai school in- stalled his image in almost all the Temples under their control and celebrated festivals for him&rdquo;. First of all, as we had occa- sion to controvert the notion of Tenkalai (Prabandic) and Vadakalai (Sri Bashya) schools elsewhere in this book, there is no such division of schools during his time. It is very doubtful whether the Temples which the author claims to belong to his school were originally Tenkalai at all. On the other hand, it can very well be inferred that the Temples in which Sri Desika&rsquo;s Deity is found installed should have been originally Vadakalai. It is also noteworthy that even the Temples of the so-called &ldquo;Tenkalai School&rdquo; of the present day are having the Desika&rsquo;s idols with Vadakali mark only with one or two unfortunate exceptions. But even these one or two are of very recent conversion.
