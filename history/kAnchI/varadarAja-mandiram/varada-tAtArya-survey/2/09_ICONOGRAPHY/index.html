  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-IX ICONOGRAPHY At the outset under the&#34;General Features&#34; on page 1, ‘Anantalwar’ is categorised under the list of metal icons in the Temple. As far as we know there is no metal (Utsavar) icon for this Murthy. Only a stone image is installed in the ‘Anantal- war’ shrine. Be that as it may, let us now proceed to examine the other aspects of this chapter. Here and on page 76, the author’s assertion that Manavala Mamuni was the last of the ACHARYAS deified in the Temple during the Vijayanagar period is a misstatement. Sri. Lakshmikumara Tatadesika along with his consort Sri Ammangar, is the last of the Acharyas who is deified in the shrine in front of the Dwajastambam where Sri Vedanta- desikar’s Mulavar and Utsavar idols are also installed. In all the perambulations of Lord Varadaraja and Sri Perundevi, showing Satari and other honours to these great Acharyas and Sri Ammangar, by turning south towards their shrine and then proceeding westwards for the processions, is an unfailing feature of our Temple. (See alo Appendix-Extracts from Sri K. N. Srinivasan’s book-“An examination of Dr. Raman’s theory on the Character of the Temple”) Then in section I the “Icons (enshrined) “the author fixes the date of the Utsavar idol of Sri Varadaraja and his Consorts Sri Devi and Budevi to the earlier half of the 11th century A. D. This sort of research to fix a date to the origin of Sri Varadaraja’s Utsavar Idol is not quite in consonance with our orthodox beliefs and sentiments. Even the historical deduction of the author about the age of the Idols do not tally with the actual facts. The date, the earlier half of the 11th century A. D. is that of Sri Ramanuja. Before him Budatalwar who belonged to the pre-christian era had sung about the Lord which is conceded by the author. According to him the age of the Alwar is the 7th century A. D’. Tirumangai- alwar is said to have flourished in the 8th century A. D. He is the last of the Alwars whereas Budatalwar is the earliest of the the Alwars Alwars who flourished before the advent of Kaliyuga according to our elders. So here also there is a . 112 difference of opinion. Anyhow the date 11th century fixed by the author do not correspond to facts. If the date the author fixes for the Utsavar idols is proved to be wrong by this reasoning, viz the Mangalasasanams of Budatalwar and Tirumangaialwar the author may still try to explain it away by saying that the songs of Alwars are in praise of the Lord of Attigiri and does not necessarily mean the present Utsavar Idol. The author has not also advanced adequate evidence to his fixation of the period to which the Utsavar belongs. It may be urged by some scholars that since according to the agamas Mula-Bera is the most important among the Beras the Alwars sang in praise of them alone. But this cannot be admitted unless strong proofs are adduced in support. Instances are not wanting to prove that references are available in their composi tions to the processions in which the Utsava Bera alone is carried through the streets 2. 46 &lt; Ranganatha” (page 164): Some of the remarks or comments of the author are peculiar in this book. One such is his statement that the popularity of the Temple of Ranganatha at Srirangam has probably influenced the erection of this Deity here.’ Popularity is not the criterion for erection or installa- tion of a particular diety in a temple. Vaishnavites generally instal Deities of the three important Stalams’ (places) of Srirangam, Tirupati and Kanchi in their temples. For instance Sri Varadaraja is installed at Srirangam, Tirupati, Tiruvallikkeni and so many other temples. Similarly Lord Srinivasa is also installed in many of our temples. The absence of Lord Srinivasa in our Temple or at Srirangam does not mean Tirupati is not popular. All these three.” Koil, Tirumalai, and Perumal Koil&#34; are, as already stated, popular and are particularly important to Sri Vaishnavites. The Ranganath shrine has been renovated at a cost of about Rs. 10,000/- recently by Sri R. Tatadesika Tatacharya, one of the trustees of our Temple. Every structure or construction gets dilapidated due to efflux of time. Even the main Temple had to be renovated frequently and one such renovation took place recently. This cannot be therefore remarked adversely as the author has chosen to do by saying though the shrine is unfortunately in a state of neglect, the deity is graceful and 6bold in its features’. . 113 C 6 · But such insinuations and remarks are not uncommon in this Treatise.’ We may add, this shrine is said to have been closed on account of the unsuitability of the deity for the puja. The granite which goes to make the deity is said to contain stone frog’ Such a stone image they say is unsuited for pujas according to sastras (agamas). But anyhow the shrine is now completely repaired as said above and presents a very neat and elegant appearance. The Varaha’ shrine is also renovated very recently by the Thatham Brothers’ of Mudal Tirumaligai, the Tatacharyas of Srirangam, at a cost of more than Rs. 20,000/-. In coming to the description of “Perundevi Thayar” he fixes a date for this icon also as the first half of the 13th century A. D. Then he goes on describing the icons of Sri Andal, Sri Malayala Nachiar, Senai Mudaliar, Anantalwar, Garuda, Sudarsana etc., in their order. Before, passing on to the next item Icons of Alwars and Acharyas’ in this chapter, we may mention an important fact which the author has not made or will not mention. Except in the case of the icons of Tayar, Andal and Malayala Nachiyar, all other idols viz. Sri Varadaraja, Narasimha, Ranganata, Varaha, Krishna, Rama, Anantalwar, Garuda, Sudarsana, Viswaksena, Danvantrin, Karumanicka Perumal (though not described in this chapter) and also Hanumans, are all wearing Vadakalai marks only. All the shrines in which the above idols are installed and described in this portion of the chapter do prominently display the countless Vadakalai marks in all the important portions of the shrines viz entrances cornices, walls etc. Now we come to the portion where “Icons of Alwars and Acharyas’ are described. What has to be noticed here is the glaring omission of the icons of Sri Vedantadesika’s, ‘Mulavar and Utsavar’ and Sri Tatadesika with Sri Ammangar enshrined in front of the Dwajastamba in the Temple. On the other hand the author is all praise and admiration for the Poise and handsomeness’, of the icon of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni. This is as it should be. But it is not fair or justifiable on the part of a true writer to omit to mention in this context, the existence of these great. Acharyas of the. Vadakalai.sect, when 8 6 114 he is discussing in detail the various other icons enshrined in the Temple. These icons representing these Acharyas are held in high esteem and importance, and they are the recipients of greater and exclusive honours from the Main Deities and senior Bakta Vigrahas of the Temple. Next under Icons (not enshrined)’ the familiar statement that Alagiya Manavala Jiyar built the Kalyana Mantapa (the hundred pillared mantapa) and his portrait figure is found here, is made. This is, most baseless, fallacious and un- warranted. The author’s persistence in repeating such unauthorised versions to make out a case that the Temple was managed originally by this Jiyar and he was responsible for the construction cannot stand the test of history, scrutiny, authenti- city or inscriptions. (See Chapter III page 61 also.) As said earlier, this mantapa is the monumental work of Sri Tata- charyas, the royal gurus of the Vijayanagar rulers. The mantapa was started during the time of Sriranga I and completed during the period of Venkatapati Deva Maharaya (Venkata I) when the Jiyar was not in the picture at all. Mantape Sathapathakye-Tatadesika nirmithe, and Chitra Sthambasatha-vritham-Tribuvanascharyavaham mantapam’ are the slokas in praise of Sri Panchamata-banjanam-Tatadesika and Lakshmikumara Tatadesika respectively that are found in the ancient texts, parts of which are inscribed in many places of the Temple. Before concluding the examination of this chapter, certain factual mistakes contained here may be pointed out. The Utsavar Idols of the Mudal Alwars and Tirumalisai Alwar are in a standing pose whereas their Mulavars are in a seated pose. The author has stated simply these Alwars are seated, without mentioning whether they relate to Mulavars or Utsavars. Evidently, he thinks both the Mulavar and Utsavar deities are seated. Similarly, he says, on the same page 167 under Icons of Alwars and Acharyas that Alavandar and Kurattalwar are also seated. This is true with regard to the Mulavar and Utsavar deities of Alavandar. But the Utsavar idol of Kurattalwar is standing and the Mulavar is sitting. In the case of Garudalwar (P. 113) Tondaradippodi Tower from the Abishekamantapa Pradakshnana (P. 59) Mulavars of Budam, Pey, Tiruppani, Tondaradippodi &amp; Tirumalisai Alwars (P. 114) Mulavars of Perialwar, Kumudavalli, Kalian, Kulasekara Alwar &amp; Sri Alavandar (P. 114) 115 ‘Danvantrin’ there is no Utsavar deity at all. But the author on page 167 says that both the Mula and Utsava images are small’. These statements clearly indicate the authors superficial knowledge of the Temple. In the last para on page 173 under “Raja Todarmal”; the author describes the three statues as Todarmal and his family, that is, the central one as Todarmal and that the other two are “probably his mother Mata-Mohan De and his wife Pita Bibi”, This is, on the face of it, wrong. Only one of the two is a female statue. Even the “guides” published by the Devastanam have erred in that they describe the statues as that of Todarmal and his “wives” or his daughters”.

Only one of the two is a female statue. Even the “guides” published by the Devastanam have erred in that they describe the statues as that of Todarmal and his “wives” or his daughters”.

  <p>CHAPTER-IX
ICONOGRAPHY
At the outset under the&quot;General Features&quot; on page 1, &lsquo;Anantalwar&rsquo; is categorised under the list of metal icons in the Temple. As far as we know there is no metal (Utsavar) icon for this Murthy. Only a stone image is installed in the &lsquo;Anantal- war&rsquo; shrine. Be that as it may, let us now proceed to examine the other aspects of this chapter. Here and on page 76, the author&rsquo;s assertion that Manavala Mamuni was the last of the ACHARYAS deified in the Temple during the Vijayanagar period is a misstatement. Sri. Lakshmikumara Tatadesika along with his consort Sri Ammangar, is the last of the Acharyas who is deified in the shrine in front of the Dwajastambam where Sri Vedanta- desikar&rsquo;s Mulavar and Utsavar idols are also installed. In all the perambulations of Lord Varadaraja and Sri Perundevi, showing Satari and other honours to these great Acharyas and Sri Ammangar, by turning south towards their shrine and then proceeding westwards for the processions, is an unfailing feature of our Temple. (See alo Appendix-Extracts from Sri K. N. Srinivasan&rsquo;s book-&ldquo;An examination of Dr. Raman&rsquo;s theory on the Character of the Temple&rdquo;) Then in section I the &ldquo;Icons (enshrined) &ldquo;the author fixes the date of the Utsavar idol of Sri Varadaraja and his Consorts Sri Devi and Budevi to the earlier half of the 11th century A. D. This sort of research to fix a date to the origin of Sri Varadaraja&rsquo;s Utsavar Idol is not quite in consonance with our orthodox beliefs and sentiments. Even the historical deduction of the author about the age of the Idols do not tally with the actual facts. The date, the earlier half of the 11th century A. D. is that of Sri Ramanuja. Before him Budatalwar who belonged to the pre-christian era had sung about the Lord which is conceded by the author. According to him the age of the Alwar is the 7th century A. D&rsquo;. Tirumangai- alwar is said to have flourished in the 8th century A. D. He is the last of the Alwars whereas Budatalwar is the earliest of the
the Alwars
Alwars who flourished before the advent of Kaliyuga according to our elders. So here also there is a
.
112
difference of opinion. Anyhow the date 11th century fixed by the author do not correspond to facts. If the date the author fixes for the Utsavar idols is proved to be wrong by this reasoning, viz the Mangalasasanams of Budatalwar and Tirumangaialwar the author may still try to explain it away by saying that the songs of Alwars are in praise of the Lord of Attigiri and does not necessarily mean the present Utsavar Idol.
The author has not also advanced adequate evidence to his fixation of the period to which the Utsavar belongs. It may be urged by some scholars that since according to the agamas Mula-Bera is the most important among the Beras the Alwars sang in praise of them alone. But this cannot be admitted unless strong proofs are adduced in support. Instances are not wanting to prove that references are available in their composi tions to the processions in which the Utsava Bera alone is carried through the streets 2.

&lt;
Ranganatha&rdquo; (page 164): Some of the remarks or comments of the author are peculiar in this book. One such is his statement that the popularity of the Temple of Ranganatha at Srirangam has probably influenced the erection of this Deity here.&rsquo; Popularity is not the criterion for erection or installa- tion of a particular diety in a temple. Vaishnavites generally instal Deities of the three important Stalams&rsquo; (places) of Srirangam, Tirupati and Kanchi in their temples. For instance Sri Varadaraja is installed at Srirangam, Tirupati, Tiruvallikkeni and so many other temples. Similarly Lord Srinivasa is also installed in many of our temples. The absence of Lord Srinivasa in our Temple or at Srirangam does not mean Tirupati is not popular. All these three.&rdquo; Koil, Tirumalai, and Perumal Koil&quot; are, as already stated, popular and are particularly important to Sri Vaishnavites. The Ranganath shrine has been renovated at a cost of about Rs. 10,000/- recently by Sri R. Tatadesika Tatacharya, one of the trustees of our Temple. Every structure or construction gets dilapidated due to efflux of time. Even the main Temple had to be renovated frequently and one such renovation took place recently. This cannot be therefore remarked adversely as the author has chosen to do by saying though the shrine is unfortunately in a state of neglect, the deity is graceful and
6bold in its features&rsquo;.

But such insinuations and remarks are not uncommon in this Treatise.&rsquo; We may add, this shrine is said to have been closed on account of the unsuitability of the deity for the puja. The granite which goes to make the deity is said to contain stone frog&rsquo; Such a stone image they say is unsuited for pujas according to sastras (agamas). But anyhow the shrine is now completely repaired as said above and presents a very neat and elegant appearance. The Varaha&rsquo; shrine is also renovated very recently by the Thatham Brothers&rsquo; of Mudal Tirumaligai, the Tatacharyas of Srirangam, at a cost of more than Rs. 20,000/-. In coming to the description of &ldquo;Perundevi Thayar&rdquo; he fixes a date for this icon also as the first half of the 13th century A. D. Then he goes on describing the icons of Sri Andal, Sri Malayala Nachiar, Senai Mudaliar, Anantalwar, Garuda, Sudarsana etc., in their order. Before, passing on to the next item Icons of Alwars and Acharyas&rsquo; in this chapter, we may mention an important fact which the author has not made or will not mention. Except in the case of the icons of Tayar, Andal and Malayala Nachiyar, all other idols viz. Sri Varadaraja, Narasimha, Ranganata, Varaha, Krishna, Rama, Anantalwar, Garuda, Sudarsana, Viswaksena, Danvantrin, Karumanicka Perumal (though not described in this chapter) and also Hanumans, are all wearing Vadakalai marks only. All the shrines in which the above idols are installed and described in this portion of the chapter do prominently display the countless Vadakalai marks in all the important portions of the shrines viz entrances cornices, walls
etc.
Now we come to the portion where &ldquo;Icons of Alwars and Acharyas&rsquo; are described. What has to be noticed here is the glaring omission of the icons of Sri Vedantadesika&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Mulavar and Utsavar&rsquo; and Sri Tatadesika with Sri Ammangar enshrined in front of the Dwajastamba in the Temple. On the other hand the author is all praise and admiration for the Poise and handsomeness&rsquo;, of the icon of his Acharya Manavala Mamuni. This is as it should be. But it is not fair or justifiable on the part of a true writer to omit to mention in this context, the existence of these great. Acharyas of the. Vadakalai.sect, when
8

he is discussing in detail the various other icons enshrined in the Temple. These icons representing these Acharyas are held in high esteem and importance, and they are the recipients of greater and exclusive honours from the Main Deities and senior Bakta Vigrahas of the Temple.
Next under Icons (not enshrined)&rsquo; the familiar statement that Alagiya Manavala Jiyar built the Kalyana Mantapa (the hundred pillared mantapa) and his portrait figure is found here, is made. This is, most baseless, fallacious and un- warranted. The author&rsquo;s persistence in repeating such unauthorised versions to make out a case that the Temple was managed originally by this Jiyar and he was responsible for the construction cannot stand the test of history, scrutiny, authenti- city or inscriptions. (See Chapter III page 61 also.) As said earlier, this mantapa is the monumental work of Sri Tata- charyas, the royal gurus of the Vijayanagar rulers.
The mantapa was started during the time of Sriranga I and completed during the period of Venkatapati Deva Maharaya (Venkata I) when the Jiyar was not in the picture at all. Mantape Sathapathakye-Tatadesika nirmithe, and Chitra Sthambasatha-vritham-Tribuvanascharyavaham mantapam&rsquo; are the slokas in praise of Sri Panchamata-banjanam-Tatadesika and Lakshmikumara Tatadesika respectively that are found in the ancient texts, parts of which are inscribed in many places of the Temple.
Before concluding the examination of this chapter, certain factual mistakes contained here may be pointed out. The Utsavar Idols of the Mudal Alwars and Tirumalisai Alwar are in a standing pose whereas their Mulavars are in a seated pose. The author has stated simply these Alwars are seated, without mentioning whether they relate to Mulavars or Utsavars. Evidently, he thinks both the Mulavar and Utsavar deities are seated. Similarly, he says, on the same page 167 under Icons of Alwars and Acharyas that Alavandar and Kurattalwar are also seated. This is true with regard to the Mulavar and Utsavar deities of Alavandar. But the Utsavar idol of Kurattalwar is
standing and the Mulavar is sitting. In the case of

115
&lsquo;Danvantrin&rsquo; there is no Utsavar deity at all. But the author on page 167 says that both the Mula and Utsava images are small&rsquo;. These statements clearly indicate the authors superficial knowledge of the Temple.
In the last para on page 173 under &ldquo;Raja Todarmal&rdquo;; the author describes the three statues as Todarmal and his family, that is, the central one as Todarmal and that the other two are &ldquo;probably his mother Mata-Mohan De and his wife Pita Bibi&rdquo;, This is, on the face of it, wrong. Only one of the two is a female statue. Even the &ldquo;guides&rdquo; published by the Devastanam have erred in that they describe the statues as that of Todarmal and his &ldquo;wives&rdquo; or his daughters&rdquo;.
