CHAPTER-II 
POLITICAL BACKGROUND 
In this Chapter Dr. K. V. Raman gives an elaborate description of the various dynasties which ruled over the south, after the Pallavas, especially with reference to Kanchi. In fairness to him it should be said that he has arranged to bring forth the history of South India in a chronological order, on the basis of the inscriptions found in the Temple of Sri Varadaraja as well as his own historical knowledge. Had it not been diluted with sectarian bias, this piece of research work could have brought him kudos. But, alas! in this treatise he has wasted his whole energy with attempts to establish a theory that this Temple is Tenkalai in character, through various flimsy and unreliable data. He has also referred to some records in the Tenkalai-Vadakalai litigation of the Temple and some books written by staunch leaders of the Tenkalai sect, whose litigant spirit and hostility to Vadakalais, are very well known. This is highly undesirable in a dissertation seeking a University Degree of the Doctor of Philosophy.

As far as the historical and inscriptional facts given here are concerned we can have no dispute with them as long as they do not contradict with each other and prove to be basically wrong. Thus we can skip over the details of the Cholas, Pandyas, Cheras, Hoysalas, Sambuvarayas, and even Vijayanagar Kings upto the portion where the author comes to deal with 'Sadasiva' (AD 1542-1576), on page 30. But on page 32 the author says that Sadasiva was killed three years after 1567 by Tirumala's son that is, in or about 1570. He also gives out that Tirumala and Sriranga ruled between 1570 and 1585. This confused chronicling needs clarity'.

In the appendix on the page 187, author himself gives the date of Venkata I as AD 1586-1614. Again on page 50, he says that Lakshmikumara Tatacharya was the manager of this Temple during the times of Vijayanagar King Venkata Į.

This accords with the dates T.T.D. inscriptions and also P. V. Jagadisa Aiyer as well as Indian History and Gopinatha Rao.' him as Venkata II. 
Page 334 Here, under "Venkata II (AD 1586-1614)" Dr. K. V. Raman concedes that inscriptions of "Venkata II " are found in Varadarajasway Temple, ranging from 1587-1605 AD. But he says "they are not of any particular importance". 
Inscriptions Nos. 421, 381, 382, 419, 462, 475, 499, 531, 587, 649, 354, 650, 651 etc., of 1919 are some of them, thus brushed aside by the author as of no particular importance. These inscriptions give an account of the great service rendered by Sri Lakshmikumara Tatacharya who was styled as the 'Srikaryadurandara' (Manager-General of Temple affairs), at Kanchi and other places. His services especially to our Temple during the reign of Venkatapati-deva-maharaya are glorified and praised, in a most telling manner, which if recognised cannot suit the purpose of the author. Hence his ignoring them as of "no particular importance." 
Since the object of the author is to make out a case for the Tenkalai predominance in the Temple he has salvaged some flimsy information through 2 or 3 inscriptions2, out of the numerous inscriptions found in our Temple in which one Alagiya-Manavala Jiyar's name finds a place. He is said to have gifted some properties to the Temple and is also styled as Koil-Kelvi (Superintendent) in one of the two inscriptions. Only this much and out of this, the author tries to build a theory that this Jiyar was responsible for almost all the Vijayanagar structures that are in existence in our Temple. There is no evidence whatsoevor to accept this theory. That he was rendering Srikaryam during the period of these two inscriptions does not indicate that he had the authority from the rulers of Vijayanagar for these constructions. Not even remotely can such a conjecture be made. On the other hand there is specific mention of these structures, which bear the emblem of Vijayanagara style, as having been executed by the Tatacharyas3 who were admittedly the royal preceptorsof 
51 
the Vijayanagar rulers and whose influence over them made it possible to achieve them, 
That the members of the Srisailapurna family had the honour of having been the spiritual heads of Kings from the period of Devaraya and Virupaksha down to the last ruler in this line cannot be disputed. It is equally impossible to disprove to the growth and spread of Vaishnavism among the rulers of this line and in the region over which they had their sway. That the Tatacharyas were mainly responsible for this cannot be denied. The rulers of Vijayanagar had their interest aroused in the maintenance of Varadarajaswami Temple at Kanchi only by the Tatacharyas and not by any other religious teacher. The spiritual leader 
spiritual leader of great distinction of the Tatacharya family should have been living then with the rulers. 
Other members of the family must have been living at Kanchi and are not mentioned in the inscriptions. This is not a proof that they ceased to enjoy their rights to render service in the Temple. It is not unlikely that Alagiyamanavala Jiyar (C1550 A.D.) was then a person found fit for getting entrusted with the work of Srikaryam in the Temple. He must have been only an agent of Panchamatabanjanam Tatadesika whose absence from Kanchi was necessitated by his presence with the rulers for instruction and guidance in both religious and secular affairs. (Some inscriptions have called him as 'Ettur Tirumala Kumara Tatacharya'). That the Jiyar was well versed in Ubayavedanta does speak highly of his attainments for being the head of a religious Math known after his name but this does not even suggest that he was the sole wielder of power in the administra- tion of the Temple. He was only an agent then. 
The last portion of Chapter II deals with the concealing of the Utsavar idol of Sri Varadaraja at Udayarpalayam during the last decades of the 17th century and its restoration in or about 1711 A.D after the iconoclastic zeal of Aurangazeb was over. There can be no dispute over the secreting or restoration of the Idol or the dates given here. The complete omission of the presence or existence of the Tatacharya custodians of the Temple during this period and the assertion that one Attan Jiyar and his 
52 
disciple Todarmalla were alone in the picture and they them- selves caused the restoration without anybody's prompting, is a point which we cannot accept as correct. We shall have occa- sion to deal with this aspect later in Chapter IV wherein also, the author has reiterated this version. Just to avoid repetition, we do not elaborate it here.
