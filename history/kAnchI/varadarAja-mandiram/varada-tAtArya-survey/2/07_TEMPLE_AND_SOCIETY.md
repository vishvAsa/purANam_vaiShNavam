CHAPTER-VII 
THE TEMPLE AND SOCIETY 
4 
The pet-concept of Dr. K. V. Raman about Attiyur' as a village originally unconnected with Kanchi, his unfailing mention of the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar as an important personage of the Temple in almost all the Chapters of this book except perhaps one or two, his theory regarding the Tenkalai- Vadakalai cult and tenets especially his claim that the Tenkalais are more liberal and catholic in their outlook towards the caste-system than the Vadakalais and their championing "the cause of the Tamil language and the Tamil Hymns" are the main features of this chapter. They are almost controversial unacceptable and baseless. These points were already answered by us earlier. He has once again brought forward the names of some Tenkalai personages to show their predominance in the Temple. Additional materials and new factors alone may improve a certain theory and not repetitions. The author brings Chakra- vartiar, Vinjimur and Gomadattar families and others under Tenkalai group. There is no justification for this hasty conclusion. While it is hardly possible to prove that this distinction was obtained in the earlier period, i. o., before 1500 A. D., it is still more difficult to bring some of the Acharyapurusha families exclusively under one sect. What is noticed at Kanchi at present regarding the identity of some of these sects should not be advanced as a sound evidence to declare all those who belonged to these families were originally members of only that sect. Unbiased deliberation is very much required to take up these issues and caution should guide while drawing conclusions. 
Another interesting portion of this chapter is his description of the 'Maths in our temple' in ancient times and one such Math is "Vedamath" of the Madwacharyas Vyasatirta, and Satyavijayatirta who have evinced interest in this Temple and honoured with certain privileges. He has also mentioned about105 
the former who was held in high respect by King Krishna- devaraya. These leaders of the Dwaita School, who are treated casually by the author, are in no way less important or less influential in those days than the Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyan or Alagiya Manavala Jiyar in respect of their services in securing certain gifts to the Temple and acquiring honours and privileges to themselves. One of the important ornaments a pendant made of precious stones, called Satya-Purna Swamy Padakkam, is even now adorned to the Deity on important occasions. The Serpent-vehicle and a village called Pulambakkam towards the celebration of a festival in the month of Avani, was got by Vyasatirta through Krishnaraya' in Saka 1433 (1511 A. D.) and certain privileges were bestowed upon Satya Vijayatirta2. 
Another important Math which contributed towards the improvement of the Temple during the 16th century is, that of the Ahobila Math which is purely a Vadakalai one. Three villages were gifted by Parankusa Jiyar and Van Satagopa Jiyar and the latter's Kaisikapurana reading and receiving the emoluments during the time of Achyutarya.' is mentioned in an inscription. "The Jiyars of Ahobila Math appear to have played an important part in extending the influence of Vaishnavism. Van Satakopa Jiyar, the founder of the Math seems to have been closely in touch with the religious life in the court. He was the guru of the great poet, Alasani Peddanna, the poet laureate of Krishnadevaraya.” This important Math has been omitted in the particular context where the other Maths of the Tenkalai sect have been included. The Alagia Manavala Math situated in the East Mada Street behind the Temple, is mentioned as having been attached to the Temple, without stating in what manner it is so. Its existence and continuance as a centre of religious and philosophical studies' even today, as mentioned here, on page 137 is quite contrary to facts. It is almost locked most of the time and if and when a. Jiyar comes to camp here from Mysore which is its headquarters, he is forced to become a party, to some litigation or other in the Tenkalai-Vadakalai disputes. This is the only contribution and activity of the Head of the Math in the religious and philosophical fields as far as Kanchipuram and our Temple is concerned. It will be interesting to note

that these Jiyars who are eulogised by Dr. K. V. Raman as having supreme position in the past in the Temple do not have any privileges in the Temple, whereas the Ahobila Math, Vyasaraya Math and Sankara Math have certain exclusive honours and privileges even now. The Ahobila Math receives on three occasions in the year honours and emoluments from the Temple including the Annual Tirunakshatram day of Sri Adi-Van-Satakopa Swamy, the founder of the Math. The only Tenkalai Jiyar that has certain honours in the Temple is that of the Vanamamalai Math. But this Math has not the fortune to find a place in the author's account whereas a non- existent Math (Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyan Math) and the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar Math which are in no way connected with our Temple are given undue prominence in the Treatise' The hollowness of the claim on the basis of such flimsy and unrealistic fiction, that our Temple is Tenkalai, can be easily understood. 
· 
As pointed out under chapter IV that even when mentioning the existence of the Kandadai, Paravastu and Tiruvengada Jiyar, they are only likened to the names of "important Vaishnavite families like the Tatacharyas of Conjivarams". 
Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar was a preceptor of the Sattada Vaishnavas and this is not a proof to declare him to have been himself a Sattada Vaishnava. If Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar was a Sattada Vaishnava as stated by the author on page 132, how did he have the family name Kandadai which is exclusively had by the descendants of Mudaliyandan ? Careless writings give rise to these problems.
