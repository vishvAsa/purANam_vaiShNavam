  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-I LOCATION AND PHYSICAL FEATURES According to the author, Dr. K. V. Raman, Attiyur was the name of the locality where the Temple of Varadaraja is situated and this place did not originally form part of Kanchi. This requires a careful scrutiny. Kanchi is the name of the town which covers a wide area including the region where our Lord Varadaraja’s Temple is situated. The Sanskrit works refer to the town by this name as noticed in the Puranas like Brahmanda. The name Kanchi occurs in all works written in Tamil. The name Kacchippedu also occurs which according to some scholars, should have meant only suburbs of the ancient town, Kacchi’. The Temples of Tiruvehka, Uragam and of Ekamreswara are stated to have been situated in Kacchippedu2. The palace of the Chola Kings is (and not within the town)3 said to have been here. The compositions of the Alwars specifically mention the name Kacchi, with reference to many of these Temples and also refer to some of the Temples as lying within the town surrounded by ramparts5. None of these temples are said to lie in Kacchippedu. The Inscriptions&#34; which are dated in the tenth century, A.D are cited to show that some of these temples lie in Kacchippedu, but the Alwars who, according to the author, lived between 650 and 850 A.D 6a, do not use this name with reference to any temple whatsoever. The inscriptions serve only as links in history and cannot by themselves serve to play the role of history itself. Besides, the Tamil classic Perumpanarruppadai states that the ramparts of Kacchi lie beyond the Tiruvehka Temple Veltu kkai which must have been to the south of Tiruvehka, is stated- in the Periya Tirumadal to lie within the ramparts of Kacchi 8. The town of Kacchi is however held on the strength of evidence available from Tamil literature, to have ben located to the north of Tiruvehka.&#34; 43 The word ‘Pedu’ shall mean a suburb but when it occurs with the word Kacchi, must mean related to Kacchi. Otherwise ‘Pedu’ could have been used with the name of any other town. what was ‘Pedu’, according to inscriptions, must mean the area of the same region, lying outside the city proper wherefrom administrtion was carried on. In all probability, the distinction could have been made for administrative purposes. Hence, Kacchi and Kacchippedu must be taken to refer to the same town Kacchi, Pedu’ referring to the divisions of the town. Otherwise, the references in the composi- tions of the Alwars could not have adequate explanation. From the inscriptions, it is clear that Kacchippedu was a town in the taluk or district of Eyilkottam, lying in the kingdom of Jayankondan These inscriptions date from 1118 to 1268 A.D.10 Inscriptions of the subsequent periods refer to the town as lying in the taluk of Uttukkadu, sometimes mentioning the kingdom as Chandragiri. Such inscriptions are more than thirtyfive. Beginning with the inscription dated 1128, the Temple of Varadaraja is stated as that of Arulalar in Tiruvatti- yur&#34;. The Temple is called Perumal Kovil12. That the name of the Deity is also Varadaraja is made clear in one inscription where the words Varamtharum Perumal13 are used. The locality Tiruvattiyur must have become reputed as having been part of the town Kanchi before 1118 A.D. This must be conce- ded, since support is avilable for this from Yapparungalavritti of the 11th century A.D., which describes the town Kanchi as a peacok with Attiyur as its head and the splendid groves its plumage. The literary evidences which are thus available, show, beyond doubt, that even before 1100 A.D. Tiruvattiyur formed part of Kanchi. The name, Kacchippedu must not, therefore, be given too much importance particularly because this word occurs mainly in the inscriptions. Vedanta Desika (1268-1399) refers to our Lord uniformly as Attigiri Tirumal’s and as Tiruvattiyurar. Much heat has been generated by the author on the use of the Tamil name Tiruvattiyur. One has to bear in mind that the name Kacchi is the Tamilised form of the Sanskrit word Kanchi, which 44 occurs as the name of this town not only in the Puranas but also in the ancient Sanskrit works17. The suggestion made by the author that the locality of Tiruvehka could have been the eastern limit of Kanchi does not stand to reason. There are firstly the lingas lying to the east of the present Little Kanchipuram’ which indicate that the town of Kanchi extended beyond the present limits in the east 18. Secondly, the Deity at Tiruvehka is stated in all sources’ as having become a having become a dam to the River Vegavati Why did the Deity serve as a dam? The answer cannot be given without reference to the Hastigirimahatmya detailing the Avatara of Lord Varadaraja on the Hastigiri, despite the author’s assertion that it “is an appeal to faith and not to reason”. So Tiruvattiyur should be as ancient as Tiruvehka. It will be improper to hold that Tiruvattiyur, a Temple not for off from Tiruvehka and intimately related to the latter, did not form part of Kanchi while the latter did. The Alwars who were steeped in the concept of the Deity as available from the Vedic sources, framed their compositions following the literary traditions of Tamil literature and so used the name Kanchi. The name Kanchi is specifically applied in the Vaishnava tradition to the locality where our Lord’s Temple is situated. Yamuna paid a visit to this Temple and worshipped the Lord20. Tirukkacchi Nambi is also known as Kanchipura mainly because of his devoted service to the Lord of Kanchi2! During Ramanuja’s time, this Temple became very much more reputed. In the “Kanchi Divyadesa Sangraha Slokamalika Manavalamamuni uses the word Kanchi to mean this Temple alone. Regarding the author’s observations on the absence of any specific references to this Temple in the compositions of the Alwars, it must be stated that Budattalwar has mentioned this Temple and its Lord22. Tirumangai Alwar calls this Deity as dark complexioned giver of boons and mentions Him in the same verse where he places the Lord of Tiruvehka before this Deity23. It is perhaps this mention of the two Deities together that inspired Vedantadesika to offer an identical depiction in45 his Vegasetustotra24. Although Although there is no other direct reference to this Deity in the hymns of tha Alwars, it is not impossible to take the first century (Pratamasataka) of the Tiruvaaimozhi of Nammalwar as composed in praise of Varadaraja. The opening verse itself states that the Alwar worships and visualises our Lord (Amararkal Atipati) i.e. Devaraja, in his mind. Significantly the idol of Nammalwar in this Temple has its fingers in the right hand, closely in touch with his heart. Vedantadesika while summarizing in sanskrit the verses of Nammalwar, observes that the Alwar found Varada in the first century (first hundred verses) of the Tiruvaaimozhi, evidently meaning that Varadaraja (Amarakal Atipati) is being extolled in this century25. It is perhaps the reference to Varadaraja in the Periya Tirumozhi26 that could be taken to support the incident which occured in the life of Tirumangai Alwar. The incident refers to this Alwar’s getting a vast sum of money from the spot in the river Vegavati where it was imbedded. He was able to locate it at the direction of Varadaraja Who appeared in his dream and gave him the location of this wealth.27 What is stated above regarding the greatness of our Lord Varadaraja as made out from or suggested by the compositions of the Alwars should convince anybody that the Alwars had sung the glory of this Lord. The objection to this position is made by some scholars on the ground, that apart from Butatalwar, others have not made a direct reference to this God and also that this Deity could not be taken to have received the glorification from Tirumangai Alwar who included Him in a decad solely devoted to Parmeswaravinnagaram28. It is needless to argue upon these lines. Either we have to admit that such indirect references should be recognised in liteary pieces of religious kind or totally deny to this Deity the reception of the homages from the Alwars. The latter position is taken up by some scholars who cite the sloka from the Varadarajapanchasat.29 The word “munisarvabaumah &#34; occurring in this sloka is taken to refer to the Alwars. Some scholars do not agree to this interpretation also. Their stand is that the word “munisarvabaumah” could refer only to the 46 eminent sages and Devatas who were present at the time of our Lord’s Avatara out of the sacrificial fire, taking into consideration the context of the previous sloka. The second objection too is baseless, since the Alwars are found to have sung in one and the same verse, the glory of more than one Deity30. Besides, it is to be noted that more often the Alwars refer to the temples by the names of the locality specifically applicable to each, such as Attiyur, Tiruvenka, Patakam, Uragam, Tirutanka and not directly associating them with Kanchi. While seeking to derive the word Attiyur, the author has made much of the word Atti, name of a tree out of which the Mulabera is admitted to have been made. Yet the name Attiyur is based on “Hastigiri” which word means a place where the Ashtadig-gajas (the elephants of the eight sides) worshipped the God, in the hoary past3 No ancient writer, particulary Vaishnava, chose to take the word “Atti” to have given rise to the name Attiyur. Andrapurna, also known as Vatukanambi, who was a direct disciple of Ramanuja, refers to our Lord as “Karisa32. This word means the Lord of the elephants and shall be taken to be similar to the word “Tiruvattiyurar”. It must be noted here that the names “Varanasailanata&#34;33 Karigiripati “34 and others are also used besides Karisa36, “Hastisaileswara “35 Hastisa37 and others. In the sloka Kanchi Divyadesa sangraha slokamalika, Manavalamamuni refers to the shrine by by the name “Karibudara” (“Karibhutara” is wrong). It is thus clear, that to connect the words atti and hasti and as the name of a wood to have been wrong. take the word atti changed to hasti is As regards the author’s theory that the “Hastigiri” is an artificial mound and and not a hill, we have answered it in Chapter III showing that it is really a small natural hillock.

Yet the name Attiyur is based on “Hastigiri” which word means a place where the Ashtadig-gajas (the elephants of the eight sides) worshipped the God, in the hoary past3 No ancient writer, particulary Vaishnava, chose to take the word “Atti” to have given rise to the name Attiyur. Andrapurna, also known as Vatukanambi, who was a direct disciple of Ramanuja, refers to our Lord as “Karisa32. This word means the Lord of the elephants and shall be taken to be similar to the word “Tiruvattiyurar”. It must be noted here that the names “Varanasailanata&#34;33 Karigiripati “34 and others are also used besides Karisa36, “Hastisaileswara “35 Hastisa37 and others. In the sloka Kanchi Divyadesa sangraha slokamalika, Manavalamamuni refers to the shrine by by the name “Karibudara” (“Karibhutara” is wrong). It is thus clear, that to connect the words atti and hasti and as the name of a wood to have been wrong. take the word atti changed to hasti is As regards the author’s theory that the “Hastigiri” is an artificial mound and and not a hill, we have answered it in Chapter III showing that it is really a small natural hillock.

LOCATION AND PHYSICAL FEATURES
According to the author, Dr. K. V. Raman, Attiyur was the name of the locality where the Temple of Varadaraja is situated and this place did not originally form part of Kanchi. This requires a careful scrutiny.
Kanchi is the name of the town which covers a wide area including the region where our Lord Varadaraja&rsquo;s Temple is situated. The Sanskrit works refer to the town by this name as noticed in the Puranas like Brahmanda. The name Kanchi occurs in all works written in Tamil. The name Kacchippedu also occurs which according to some scholars, should have meant only suburbs of the ancient town, Kacchi&rsquo;. The Temples of Tiruvehka, Uragam and of Ekamreswara are stated to have been situated in Kacchippedu2. The palace of the Chola Kings is (and not within the town)3 said to have been here.
The compositions of the Alwars specifically mention the name Kacchi, with reference to many of these Temples and also refer to some of the Temples as lying within the town surrounded by ramparts5. None of these temples are said to lie in Kacchippedu. The Inscriptions&quot; which are dated in the tenth century, A.D are cited to show that some of these temples lie in Kacchippedu, but the Alwars who, according to the author, lived between 650 and 850 A.D 6a, do not use this name with reference to any temple whatsoever. The inscriptions serve only as links in history and cannot by themselves serve to play the role of history itself.
Besides, the Tamil classic Perumpanarruppadai states that the ramparts of Kacchi lie beyond the Tiruvehka Temple Veltu kkai which must have been to the south of Tiruvehka, is stated- in the Periya Tirumadal to lie within the ramparts of Kacchi 8. The town of Kacchi is however held on the strength of evidence available from Tamil literature, to have ben located to the north of Tiruvehka.&quot;
43
The word &lsquo;Pedu&rsquo; shall mean a suburb but when it occurs with the word Kacchi, must mean related to Kacchi. Otherwise &lsquo;Pedu&rsquo; could have been used with the name of any other town. what was &lsquo;Pedu&rsquo;, according to inscriptions, must mean the area of the same region, lying outside the city proper wherefrom administrtion was carried on.
In all probability, the distinction could have been made for administrative purposes. Hence, Kacchi and Kacchippedu must be taken to refer to the same town Kacchi, Pedu&rsquo; referring to the divisions of the town. Otherwise, the references in the composi- tions of the Alwars could not have adequate explanation.
From the inscriptions, it is clear that Kacchippedu was a town in the taluk or district of Eyilkottam, lying in the kingdom of Jayankondan These inscriptions date from 1118 to 1268 A.D.10 Inscriptions of the subsequent periods refer to the town as lying in the taluk of Uttukkadu, sometimes mentioning the kingdom as Chandragiri. Such inscriptions are more than thirtyfive. Beginning with the inscription dated 1128, the Temple of Varadaraja is stated as that of Arulalar in Tiruvatti- yur&quot;. The Temple is called Perumal Kovil12. That the name of the Deity is also Varadaraja is made clear in one inscription where the words Varamtharum Perumal13 are used. The locality Tiruvattiyur must have become reputed as having been part of the town Kanchi before 1118 A.D. This must be conce- ded, since support is avilable for this from Yapparungalavritti of the 11th century A.D., which describes the town Kanchi as a peacok with Attiyur as its head and the splendid groves its plumage. The literary evidences which are thus available, show, beyond doubt, that even before 1100 A.D. Tiruvattiyur formed part of Kanchi. The name, Kacchippedu must not, therefore, be given too much importance particularly because this word occurs mainly in the inscriptions.
Vedanta Desika (1268-1399) refers to our Lord uniformly as Attigiri Tirumal&rsquo;s and as Tiruvattiyurar. Much heat has been generated by the author on the use of the Tamil name Tiruvattiyur. One has to bear in mind that the name Kacchi is the Tamilised form of the Sanskrit word Kanchi, which
44
occurs as the name of this town not only in the Puranas but also in the ancient Sanskrit works17.
The suggestion made by the author that the locality of Tiruvehka could have been the eastern limit of Kanchi does not stand to reason. There are firstly the lingas lying to the east of the present Little Kanchipuram&rsquo; which indicate that the town of Kanchi extended beyond the present limits in the east 18. Secondly, the Deity at Tiruvehka is stated in all sources&rsquo; as having become a
having become a dam to the River Vegavati Why did the Deity serve as a dam? The answer cannot be given without reference to the Hastigirimahatmya detailing the Avatara of Lord Varadaraja on the Hastigiri, despite the author&rsquo;s assertion that it &ldquo;is an appeal to faith and not to reason&rdquo;. So Tiruvattiyur should be as ancient as Tiruvehka. It will be improper to hold that Tiruvattiyur, a Temple not for off from Tiruvehka and intimately related to the latter, did not form part of Kanchi while the latter did.
The Alwars who were steeped in the concept of the Deity as available from the Vedic sources, framed their compositions following the literary traditions of Tamil literature and so used the name Kanchi. The name Kanchi is specifically applied in the Vaishnava tradition to the locality where our Lord&rsquo;s Temple is situated. Yamuna paid a visit to this Temple and worshipped the Lord20. Tirukkacchi Nambi is also known as Kanchipura mainly because of his devoted service to the Lord of Kanchi2! During Ramanuja&rsquo;s time, this Temple became very much more reputed. In the &ldquo;Kanchi Divyadesa Sangraha Slokamalika Manavalamamuni uses the word Kanchi to mean this Temple
alone.
Regarding the author&rsquo;s observations on the absence of any specific references to this Temple in the compositions of the Alwars, it must be stated that Budattalwar has mentioned this Temple and its Lord22. Tirumangai Alwar calls this Deity as dark complexioned giver of boons and mentions Him in the same verse where he places the Lord of Tiruvehka before this Deity23. It is perhaps this mention of the two Deities together that inspired Vedantadesika to offer an identical depiction in45
his Vegasetustotra24. Although
Although there is no other direct reference to this Deity in the hymns of tha Alwars, it is not impossible to take the first century (Pratamasataka) of the Tiruvaaimozhi of Nammalwar as composed in praise of Varadaraja. The opening verse itself states that the Alwar worships and visualises our Lord (Amararkal Atipati) i.e. Devaraja, in his mind. Significantly the idol of Nammalwar in this Temple has its fingers in the right hand, closely in touch with his heart. Vedantadesika while summarizing in sanskrit the verses of Nammalwar, observes that the Alwar found Varada in the first century (first hundred verses) of the Tiruvaaimozhi, evidently meaning that Varadaraja (Amarakal Atipati) is being extolled in this century25.
It is perhaps the reference to Varadaraja in the Periya Tirumozhi26 that could be taken to support the incident which occured in the life of Tirumangai Alwar. The incident refers to this Alwar&rsquo;s getting a vast sum of money from the spot in the river Vegavati where it was imbedded. He was able to locate it at the direction of Varadaraja Who appeared in his dream and gave him the location of this wealth.27
What is stated above regarding the greatness of our Lord Varadaraja as made out from or suggested by the compositions of the Alwars should convince anybody that the Alwars had sung the glory of this Lord. The objection to this position is made by some scholars on the ground, that apart from Butatalwar, others have not made a direct reference to this God and also that this Deity could not be taken to have received the glorification from Tirumangai Alwar who included Him in a decad solely devoted to Parmeswaravinnagaram28. It is needless to argue upon these lines. Either we have to admit that such indirect references should be recognised in liteary pieces of religious kind or totally deny to this Deity the reception of the homages from the Alwars. The latter position is taken up by some scholars who cite the sloka from the Varadarajapanchasat.29 The word &ldquo;munisarvabaumah &quot; occurring in this sloka is taken to refer to the Alwars. Some scholars do not agree to this interpretation also. Their stand is that the word &ldquo;munisarvabaumah&rdquo; could refer only to the
46
eminent sages and Devatas who were present at the time of our Lord&rsquo;s Avatara out of the sacrificial fire, taking into consideration the context of the previous sloka. The second objection too is baseless, since the Alwars are found to have sung in one and the same verse, the glory of more than one Deity30. Besides, it is to be noted that more often the Alwars refer to the temples by the names of the locality specifically applicable to each, such as Attiyur, Tiruvenka, Patakam, Uragam, Tirutanka and not directly associating them with Kanchi.
While seeking to derive the word Attiyur, the author has made much of the word Atti, name of a tree out of which the Mulabera is admitted to have been made. Yet the name Attiyur is based on &ldquo;Hastigiri&rdquo; which word means a place where the Ashtadig-gajas (the elephants of the eight sides) worshipped the God, in the hoary past3 No ancient writer, particulary Vaishnava, chose to take the word &ldquo;Atti&rdquo; to have given rise to the name Attiyur. Andrapurna, also known as Vatukanambi, who was a direct disciple of Ramanuja, refers to our Lord as &ldquo;Karisa32. This word means the Lord of the elephants and shall be taken to be similar to the word &ldquo;Tiruvattiyurar&rdquo;. It must be noted here that the names &ldquo;Varanasailanata&quot;33 Karigiripati &ldquo;34
and others are also used besides Karisa36,
&ldquo;Hastisaileswara &ldquo;35 Hastisa37 and others.
In the sloka Kanchi Divyadesa sangraha slokamalika, Manavalamamuni refers to the shrine by
by the name &ldquo;Karibudara” (“Karibhutara&rdquo; is wrong). It is thus clear, that to connect the words atti and hasti and as the name of a wood to have been
wrong.
take the word atti changed to hasti is
As regards the author&rsquo;s theory that the &ldquo;Hastigiri&rdquo; is an artificial mound and and not a hill, we have answered it in Chapter III showing that it is really a small natural hillock.
