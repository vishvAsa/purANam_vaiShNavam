  <meta property="og:description" content="CHAPTER-VIII ARCHITECTURE The theory that “Hastigiri’ is an artificial mound and an elevated platform is once again harped upon in para 2 of this chapter. The dates of the second stage of the construction of the Temple, which includes the Sanctum Sanctorum on the Hill and Sri Narasimha’s shrine below, are fixed to the regime of the Chola Kings Rajathiraja-I and Kulothunga I, in the 11th and 12th centuries A. D. The greater constructional activity during the succeeding Vijayanagara period like the Kalyana, Tulabara, Unjal and Vasanta Mantapas are also detailed, as also the Gopura in the east. Then he goes on describing the architecture one by one starting from the first prakara. &#34;” On page 149 under “first prakara”, the Punyakoti Vimana (Fig. 4)&#34; is described as having “completely been renovated and replastered in the thirties of the present century, thus obliterating all the old features”. This statement is entirely wrong. The renovation took place, when the Temple was under the management of a Smarta Receiver, a common person appointed by the District Judge in 1929 pending the Scheme suit in OS-I of 1928. He was in sole charge of the administration. Considering the sectarian disputes and controversies in the Temple the Receiver. Sri C. Somasundara Aiyar, under the orders of the District Judge, took photos and details of the structures, had them signed by all the parties concerned in the presence of common persons and sent it to the Judge for his approval. The District Judge directed the Receiver to see to it that the original features of the structures as submitted by him are in no way changed or obliterated by the renovation. The renovation was effected, strictly in accordance with the above direction and the above list prepared by the Receiver with regard to its original features without any change. Dr. K. V. Raman evidently has his own reasons to state that all the old features of the Vimana were obliterated by the renovation. The main irritant to his eyes is the existence of a bold Vadakalai mark flanked by Sankum and 108 Chakaram on both sides, built in brick and mortar on the “Punyakoti Vimana” Evidently because of this he has taken his figure No. 4 from the back portion of the Vimana instead of the front one, since the latter will display the Vadakalai mark prominently. We are now giving the illustration of the front portion of the Vimana in this book. The four garudas on the four sides of the Vimana also have Vadakalai marks on their faces. Another point that has to be noted here, is his mention, about the “epigraph that Krishnadevaraya covered this Punyakoti Vimana with gold some time in A. D. 1514”. Here he has left out purposely the repairing and regilding of the Vimana by Sri Tatadesika, though he himself has to admit it on page 83 under “Tatacharya family” that Sri Tatacharya “repaired and regilt the Vimanam set up by Krishnadevaraya as it got defaced and weather beaten in the course of a century”. If the latter renovation, by Sri Tatadesika in mentioned in this context it will clearly establish the existence of the Vadakalai features of the Vimana which the author wants to avoid. As the author himself has stated earlier on page 87, the Vijayanagar Kings started the practice of putting the sectarian marks on the structures. Vadakalai marks were carved in the Temples renovated and on the slabs, put on, mentioning gifts or offerings, during the reign of Sadasivadeva Maharaya, the Vijayanagar ruler. As a great Vadakalai Acharya Sri Tata- desika with the patronage of the Vijayanagar Kings who were particular in putting the sectarian marks could not have omitted to put the Vadakalai mark on the Vimana which is a most suitable and essential place for displaying the mark. But the author by his remarks here, wants to make it appear that something new has been introduced during the renovation of the Vimana in the thirties of this century. Hence his careful omission of the renovation of the Vimana by Sri Tatadesika in early 17th century A. D. in this context. Even Krishnadevaraya, who was a staunch Vaishnava and a disciple of “Tatacharya” could not have omitted. to put this sectarian mark when he effected the repairs in 1514 A. D. In describing Perundevi Tayar shrine on page 153, he fixes the date of its coming into existence in the beginning of the 13th century and its subsequent replacement during the end of the Inside View of the Mirror Mansion A View of the Punyakoti Vimanam (P. 108) (P. 108) Danvantrin (P. 115) Tiruvanantalwar (P. 111) 109 15th century. We are not sure about this also. Improvements might have been effected at various periods. But to fix a particular time for its (the shrine’s) coming into existence viz., the 13th century, may not correspond to reality and also not proper. Sri Perundevi Tayar is enshrined along with Sri Varada- raja from time immemorial in this Temple. The Kalyana-Koti Vimana’s architectural features&#34; are said to be “masked by copper sheets”. The copper plates are designed totally to fit in with the original features of the Vimana and therefore there is no question of their being masked’ or hidden. The author cannot be expected to know about this, since he is not conversant with all these minute particulars of the Temple. C The usual repetition of Alagiya Manavala Jiyar as the archi- tect of the front Mahamantapa of the Tayar Shrine is made under the heading “Vijayanagar Mandapas”. It may be once for all stated here with all the emphasis at our command, that wherever the Vijayanagar Architecture is to be found in the Temple, it is the work of the Tatacharyas alone who were the acknowledged royal gurus of the Vijayanagar rulers and to whom alone the royal patronage was extended for undertaking these works. Next comes the heading “Gopura Entrance and the Compound Wall” on page 154. The “Todarmal Vasal” which is mentioned by him is called “Thondaradippodi Vasal”. The reconstruction of the compound wall (prakara) enclosing the third prakara, according to the author, is said to have been done by the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar. Earlier we had occasion to show in dealing with chapter III, that it was not so. There was no necessity to reconstruct it since it was originally built so strongly and solidly. This is also attested by an epigraph3. In order to connect the name of Alagiya Manavala Jiyar, in each and every item of the structure of the Temple in his narrative, the author took this also as one more opportunity. The portrait figures which are said to be kept in small niches at the top of this compound wall is described by him, as belonging to this Jiyar. There is no warrant or basis for this assumption also. If at all, it may be the work of the Attan Jiyar family who introduced several innovations during the period between 110 1711 to 1792 A. D. At any rate Alagiya Manavala Jiyar has no place or any sustained connection with the Temple, as sought to be made out by the author. One more interesting factor, that can be deduced from this, is the most insignificant and shady places where the author claims the existence of the Tenkalai features in this Temple. If they are true they would have been displayed in the front and prominent portions of the Temple. Not a single place is important, prominent or sacred, where these Tenkalai features are alleged to exist in our Temple. This is a clear proof of their stealthy introduction. Some of these which lurked during the course of the litigations in later times had been permitted to remain, due to their existence previously for sometime. This however cannot give the impress of Tenkalai predominance in the Temple. “The Krishna Shrine” mentioned on page 155 is called “Venugopalan Sannidhi &#34; and not as “Krishna Shrine” though both can mean the same. The author at the end of this chapter repeats the bogey of the artificial mound for “Hastigiri” while at the same time recognising its being sung by Kuratalwar, Tiru- kkachinambi etc., as a Hill. We need not go into this question once again, as we have already answered it earlier in chapter III to show that “Hastigiri” is really a Hill. When improvements were effected in later times, it was fully covered by walls and structures. This makes it more compact and look more artistic. The “camouflaging” attributed by the author for this improve- ment, that took place in later times, is therefore meaningless. FOOT NOTES">

  <p>CHAPTER-VIII
ARCHITECTURE
The theory that &ldquo;Hastigiri&rsquo; is an artificial mound and an elevated platform is once again harped upon in para 2 of this chapter. The dates of the second stage of the construction of the Temple, which includes the Sanctum Sanctorum on the Hill and Sri Narasimha&rsquo;s shrine below, are fixed to the regime of the Chola Kings Rajathiraja-I and Kulothunga I, in the 11th and 12th centuries A. D. The greater constructional activity during the succeeding Vijayanagara period like the Kalyana, Tulabara, Unjal and Vasanta Mantapas are also detailed, as also the Gopura in the east. Then he goes on describing the architecture one by one starting from the first prakara.
&quot;&rdquo;
On page 149 under &ldquo;first prakara&rdquo;, the Punyakoti Vimana (Fig. 4)&quot; is described as having &ldquo;completely been renovated and replastered in the thirties of the present century, thus obliterating all the old features&rdquo;. This statement is entirely wrong. The renovation took place, when the Temple was under the management of a Smarta Receiver, a common person appointed by the District Judge in 1929 pending the Scheme suit in OS-I of 1928. He was in sole charge of the administration. Considering the sectarian disputes and controversies in the Temple the Receiver. Sri C. Somasundara Aiyar, under the orders of the District Judge, took photos and details of the structures, had them signed by all the parties concerned in the presence of common persons and sent it to the Judge for his approval. The District Judge directed the Receiver to see to it that the original features of the structures as submitted by him are in no way changed or obliterated by the renovation. The renovation was effected, strictly in accordance with the above direction and the above list prepared by the Receiver with regard to its original features without any change. Dr. K. V. Raman evidently has his own reasons to state that all the old features of the Vimana were obliterated by the renovation. The main irritant to his eyes is the existence of a bold Vadakalai mark flanked by Sankum and
108
Chakaram on both sides, built in brick and mortar on the &ldquo;Punyakoti Vimana&rdquo; Evidently because of this he has taken his figure No. 4 from the back portion of the Vimana instead of the front one, since the latter will display the Vadakalai mark prominently. We are now giving the illustration of the front portion of the Vimana in this book. The four garudas on the four sides of the Vimana also have Vadakalai marks on their faces. Another point that has to be noted here, is his mention, about the &ldquo;epigraph that Krishnadevaraya covered this Punyakoti Vimana with gold some time in A. D. 1514&rdquo;. Here he has left out purposely the repairing and regilding of the Vimana by Sri Tatadesika, though he himself has to admit it on page 83 under &ldquo;Tatacharya family&rdquo; that Sri Tatacharya &ldquo;repaired and regilt the Vimanam set up by Krishnadevaraya as it got defaced and weather beaten in the course of a century&rdquo;. If the latter renovation, by Sri Tatadesika in mentioned in this context it will clearly establish the existence of the Vadakalai features of the Vimana which the author wants to avoid. As the author himself has stated earlier on page 87, the Vijayanagar Kings started the practice of putting the sectarian marks on the structures. Vadakalai marks were carved in the Temples renovated and on the slabs, put on, mentioning gifts or offerings, during the reign of Sadasivadeva Maharaya, the Vijayanagar ruler. As a great Vadakalai Acharya Sri Tata- desika with the patronage of the Vijayanagar Kings who were particular in putting the sectarian marks could not have omitted to put the Vadakalai mark on the Vimana which is a most suitable and essential place for displaying the mark. But the author by his remarks here, wants to make it appear that something new has been introduced during the renovation of the Vimana in the thirties of this century. Hence his careful omission of the renovation of the Vimana by Sri Tatadesika in early 17th century A. D. in this context.
Even Krishnadevaraya, who was a staunch Vaishnava and a disciple of &ldquo;Tatacharya&rdquo; could not have omitted. to put this sectarian mark when he effected the repairs in 1514 A. D.
In describing Perundevi Tayar shrine on page 153, he fixes the date of its coming into existence in the beginning of the 13th century and its subsequent replacement during the end of the

15th century. We are not sure about this also. Improvements might have been effected at various periods. But to fix a particular time for its (the shrine&rsquo;s) coming into existence viz., the 13th century, may not correspond to reality and also not proper. Sri Perundevi Tayar is enshrined along with Sri Varada- raja from time immemorial in this Temple. The Kalyana-Koti Vimana&rsquo;s architectural features&quot; are said to be &ldquo;masked by copper sheets&rdquo;. The copper plates are designed totally to fit in with the original features of the Vimana and therefore there is no question of their being masked&rsquo; or hidden. The author cannot be expected to know about this, since he is not conversant with all these minute particulars of the Temple.
C
The usual repetition of Alagiya Manavala Jiyar as the archi- tect of the front Mahamantapa of the Tayar Shrine is made under the heading &ldquo;Vijayanagar Mandapas&rdquo;. It may be once for all stated here with all the emphasis at our command, that wherever the Vijayanagar Architecture is to be found in the Temple, it is the work of the Tatacharyas alone who were the acknowledged royal gurus of the Vijayanagar rulers and to whom alone the royal patronage was extended for undertaking these works.
Next comes the heading &ldquo;Gopura Entrance and the Compound Wall&rdquo; on page 154. The &ldquo;Todarmal Vasal&rdquo; which is mentioned by him is called &ldquo;Thondaradippodi Vasal&rdquo;. The reconstruction of the compound wall (prakara) enclosing the third prakara, according to the author, is said to have been done by the Alagiya Manavala Jiyar. Earlier we had occasion to show in dealing with chapter III, that it was not so. There was no necessity to reconstruct it since it was originally built so strongly and solidly. This is also attested by an epigraph3.
In order to connect the name of Alagiya Manavala Jiyar, in each and every item of the structure of the Temple in his narrative, the author took this also as one more opportunity. The portrait figures which are said to be kept in small niches at the top of this compound wall is described by him, as belonging to this Jiyar. There is no warrant or basis for this assumption also. If at all, it may be the work of the Attan Jiyar family who introduced several innovations during the period between
110
1711 to 1792 A. D. At any rate Alagiya Manavala Jiyar has no place or any sustained connection with the Temple, as sought to be made out by the author. One more interesting factor, that can be deduced from this, is the most insignificant and shady places where the author claims the existence of the Tenkalai features in this Temple. If they are true they would have been displayed in the front and prominent portions of the Temple. Not a single place is important, prominent or sacred, where these Tenkalai features are alleged to exist in our Temple. This is a clear proof of their stealthy introduction. Some of these which lurked during the course of the litigations in later times had been permitted to remain, due to their existence previously for sometime. This however cannot give the impress of Tenkalai predominance in the Temple.
&ldquo;The Krishna Shrine&rdquo; mentioned on page 155 is called &ldquo;Venugopalan Sannidhi &quot; and not as &ldquo;Krishna Shrine&rdquo; though both can mean the same. The author at the end of this chapter repeats the bogey of the artificial mound for &ldquo;Hastigiri&rdquo; while at the same time recognising its being sung by Kuratalwar, Tiru- kkachinambi etc., as a Hill. We need not go into this question once again, as we have already answered it earlier in chapter III to show that &ldquo;Hastigiri&rdquo; is really a Hill. When improvements were effected in later times, it was fully covered by walls and structures. This makes it more compact and look more artistic. The &ldquo;camouflaging&rdquo; attributed by the author for this improve- ment, that took place in later times, is therefore meaningless.
