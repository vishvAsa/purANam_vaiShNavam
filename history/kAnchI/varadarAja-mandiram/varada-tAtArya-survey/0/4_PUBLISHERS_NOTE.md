+++
We the members of Sri Tatadesika Tiruvamsastar Sabha and ancient adherents to Sri Varadarajaswami Temple, Kanchi entrusted this noble service of compiling this book to our esteemed brother Sri R. Varada Tatacharya, experienced as he is as a Trustee of the Temple for well nigh three decades. Our sole object in this venture is to provide a true and unbiased history of the Temple, its character and management based on archaeological, inscriptional and irrebuttable evidence, documentary and intrinsic. One of the main aims in starting the Sabha more than a decade ago, is also to serve such a purpose viz to bring out a historical treatise of our Temple and the contribution of our forebears towards its improvement and maintenance. 
True to his life as an ardent devotee of the Lord and our eminent Acharya, the author readily acceeded to our request with an inspiring sense of duty and has fulfilled the task with all thoroughness. Needless to say that he has taken great pains to project without any predilection whatsoever a vivid account of the subject-matter in its proper perspective, tracing the same from the days of Sri Vedanta Desika, with emphasis on the role of the Tatacharyas in the development, management and upkeep of the Temple. We are grateful to him for having refuted effectively the biased and distorted versions introduced with ulterior motives, in several portions of the publication "Varadarajaswami Temple" by Dr. K. V. Raman. 
We are also bound to express our deep sense of gratitude to Dr. V. Varadacharya for the contribution of his excellent 'Foreword', which may, without exaggeration, be described as the "crest-Jewel" of this book. 
SRI TATADESIKA TIRUVAMSASTAR SABHA, 
KANCHI.PREFACE 
The Lord aloft the twenty four steps alone gave me the necessary strength and inspiration to undertake this responsible work under the behests of Sri Tatadesika Tiruvamsastar Sabha, Kanchi. When I started writing this book, I never thought or hoped, I could gather so much material of historical and inscriptional importance. I had the rare fortune of serving our Lord for quite some time as a trustee of the Temple. This experience also gave me somewhat the courage and impetus to take upon myself the task of refuting the several wrong state- ments and distortions and countering the various sectarian versions contained in the Treatise' by Dr. K. V. Raman, about our Temple.

I have arranged to divide the subject matter of my 'Critical Survey' into two parts. The first part. I have devoted for presenting the positive side of the picture viz., a brief history of our Temple, dating back to the fifteenth century A. D., particularly with reference to the important role played by the Tatacharyas who in their capacity as the custodians of the Temple as well as the royal preceptors of the Vijayanagar monarchs and Mysore Kings were able to effect the several major improvements in the Temple like the huge construction of Towers, Rampart walls, Mantapas, Vimanas etc., securing substantial properties for the maintenance and upkeep of the institution and making the several vehicles and precious jewels to the God, from the fifteenth century onwards. 
The Critical Survey' proper is dealt with in the second part. For this purpose, I have taken Dr. K. V. Raman's "Treatise' chapter by chapter with the headings with which they are found there and dealt with them in their order so that the readers may follow them easily in the absence of the original in their hands. This has also facilitated my meeting the contro- versial points found therein squarely, in their order. 
There is some unavoidable delay for this publication. Firstly we came to know about Dr. K. V. Raman's book long after its publication. The Treatise' could not be secured

easily locally. Nextly, the Saba' which was made aware of it, had to resolve and sanction the publication by me in its general body. Naturally, all these took sometime. 
I sincerely hope not only our present generation but posterity will be benefited by this dissertation since this has, as its basis, purely historical and inscriptional facts and figures. I hope also, our younger generation may take up the threads from this and utilise them for further developing the thesis and bringing out treatises, if and when circumstances warrant it. 
Sri Tatadesika Tiruvamsastar Saba deserves all the credit and praise for this undertaking. 
Next to our Saba, Sri V. Sundararajan, B.E., was immensely helpful in bringing this work to a successful conclusion in several respects including the procuring of Dr. K. V. Raman's book with great difficulty. I cannot thank him adequately for all this. 
Dr. V. Varadacharya with his rich experience and erudition gave me very useful suggestions and guidance apart from his inestimable "Foreword". It will be an exercise in futility to express my feelings of gratitude to him. 
I will be failing in my duty if I do not place on record my sense of appreciation and thanks for the unstinted co-operation and assistance I received throughout from my brothers and friends Messers R. N., R. T., T. L. K., A. L. S., Tatacharyas, R. Krishnaswamy Tatachari, R. S. Kannan, T. R. Ragunandan, K. R. Rajagopalan, S. Krishnamachari and P. V. Seshadri for the fulfilment of this task. 
I have to thank also the Archaeological survey of India, Southern Circle-Madras-9, who, kindly responding to my application, have furnished the bulk of the photos, which, are their copy right and appear in this book. Finally I cannot afford to omit to congratulate and thank M/s. Super Power Press, Madras-1, for bringing out this publication attractively. 
R. VARADA TATACHARYA.
