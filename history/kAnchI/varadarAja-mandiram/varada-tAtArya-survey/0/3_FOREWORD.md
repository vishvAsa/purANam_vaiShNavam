I have great pleasure in writing the Foreword 
to the "Critical Survey" written by my esteemed friend Sri R. Varada Tatacharya who undertakes a critical study of Dr. K. V. Raman's book "Sri Varadarajaswami Temple, Kanchi". The author throws much light on the crucial issues raised and discussed by Dr. K. V. Raman. 
Dr. K. V. Raman has made an orginal contribution on the history and management of this temple. He deserves credit for collecting the required data from various sources and presenting them in this book. Among the ten chapters, which this con- tains, special mention must be made of Ch. II VIII, IX & X for the valuable information they contain. At the same time, it must be said that the book abounds in conclusions arrived at hypo- thetically, assumptions based on predilections and hastily drawn observations. As a diligent and hard worker in the field of re- search, he could have avoided much of these. His purpose in writing the Thesis on the subject treated in this book, is not merely to provide relevant information as found in the four chapters noted above but also, or rather to suggest, on the basis of available evidence, that the Tenkalai traits are predominantly noticed in this temple. 
In this book "Critical Survey", Sri R. Varada Tatacharya has ably brought to light the shortcomings and defects found in Dr. K.V. Raman's book and after a critical examination of them, has advanced sound arguments while refuting them. In this, he proves himself to be free from bias and has pinned his faith on authentic evidence for drawing his conclusions. He has avoided the narratives and anecdotes that are irrelevant and so his work is mainly a Critical Survey of Dr. K. V. Raman's book. 
Of the several ways adopted by man to convey his feelings and intentions to another, writing occupies a more prominent position than others. The written records endure as long as the materials in which they are presented last. They are to serve 
viii 
their purpose by educating the people and guiding them on- right lines. The historian has a significant role to play as a writer. He has to present the past occurrences as they happened then without idealising them with his personal views and avoid- ing speculations. Loose statements and expressions that serve no purpose shall not find room in his writings. Otherwise, he will be arousing confusion among the unlearned who have more faith in it than in their understanding of it. The Lord's utterance "na buddhibhedam janayet" (Gita 3.26) "The wise man shall not disturb the minds, (of the unlearned)" must be respected. Posterity shall not be drawn astray to wrong thinking developed by careless writing. 
Dr. K. V. Raman's writing is uniformly good but expres- sions like 'probably', 'it appears', 'it seems' and others are found used without adequate justification. The word 'probably' shall be used when something could not be affirmed as 'is' or 'is not'. There is room for indecision here. If there is scope here for taking a position in between 'is' and 'is not' and if this position has a leaning on probability without detriment to improbability, then expressions like these could be used. Predilection for a dogma and intentional advocacy for a creed shall not be the ground for using them particularly when their use could not be substantiated. Dr. K. V. Raman's use of them is likely to lead casual readers to treating his writing as having veracity which it does not possess. 
The second point that requires consideration here is the author's attempt to prove Alakiya Manavala Jiyar as responsible for the building of some structures in the temple and that he wielded influence over the administration of the temple. This is far from true. In the present case, the Jiyar is mentioned in two inscriptions as doing Srikaryam service in the temple. He is not mentioned there with any honorific such as Srimadvedamargapratishtapanacarya indicating his status as Guru of the then rulers, who were the Kings at Vijayanagaram. On whose authority, did he take up the work of building the structures in the temple? What was he before the dates of these inscriptions and what happened to him after this period, when 
ix 
according to the inscriptions, there were others doing the Sri- karyam work? He had no hand in the building of the hundred- pillared mandapam and the figure of the ascetic carved there is certainly not his. Besides, the inscription in the temple of Sri Dipaprakasa mention one Alakiya Manavala Jiyar as well studied in both the Vedantas and as an authority in the Sri- bashya. As the dates are not mentioned here, it is not possible to identify the ascetic. In one other respect, the author has erred. Kandadai Ramanuja Aiyangar is stated by him as the first person to hold the post of Srikaryam in this temple. 
Nextly, it must be said that there is no substance in using the word Prabandhaic predominance with reference to this temple. To whichever sect the temple could belong, every shrine of the major kind has smaller shrines for the Alvars and Acharyas. Annual. birthday festivals for these are performed with the recitation of the Vedas and Divyaprabandham. Likewise, the rituals in the temple are conducted in strict accordance to the Vaikhanasa or Pancharatra Agama. The recitation of the Vedas or the Prabandhams do not form part of the ritual. Where then does the question arise about the relative importance of the Prabandham ? 
It is idle to argue that the character of the sub-shrines should determine the original nature of the main shrine. It must also be borne in mind that the deities of the central shrines alone get daily puja elaborately. This is proof to admit that the nature of the sub-shrines should be in accordance with that of the central shrines and not vice-versa. 
Sri R. Varada Tatacharya has done well by drawing atten- tion to many of these shortcomings such as non-mention of the Vedaparayana and its attractiveness, Tatadesikan's Tiruna- ksatra festival and of the Vadakalai marks which are promi- nently displayed in the temple. Again, it will be appropriate to refer to Dr. K. V. Raman's remarks on the Tatacharyas and their position in this temple. In his view, there is no evidence from the inscriptions that they were at Kanchi before the middle of the 16th century. With the downfall of the Vijaya- nagaram rule, they left Kanchi to 
left Kanchi to seek their fortunes elsewhere. They returned to Kanchi about the beginning of

the 18th Century. That these are mere assumptions for which evidences are not available in well argued by Sri R. Varada Tatacharya. 
Some observations may be made here for clarifying the issues. It is known to everybody that Ramanuja received instructions of the Ramayana from Srisailapurna and taught them to his pupils. Pillan his spiritual son inherited this traditional doctrine from his Guru and taught them to his pupils and descendants. The Ettur brothers had inherited the secret doctrines of the Ramayana from their ancestors who descended from Srisaila Purna and Pillan. With their abiding faith in the efficacy in the immortal epic, they were able to drive away the evil spirits from the palace of the Vijayanagaram Rulers, as a result of which Virupaksha, the then Ruler displayed his leanings on Vaishnavism. The successive rulers became Vaishnavas. The descendants of Virupaksha became the disciples of the members of the family of the Ettur brothers and their descendants. It is the members of this family that were responsible for the spread of Vaishnavism in the Vijayanagaram Empire and took keen interest in the maintenance of the Varadarajaswami Temple at Kanchipuram. Achyutaraya and Krishnadevaraya, in particular, paid visits to the Kanchipuram Temple and worshipped the Lord, making several endowments to the temple. It is not therefore surprising to note that Lakshmi Kumara Tatadesikan was much devoted to Sri Rama whose name he uttered repeatedly, as a result of which he was saved from robbers by Hanuman. Out of gratitude and in commemoration of the help rendered by Hanuman, Lakshmi Kumara Tatadesika composed a poem Hanumadvimsati in 24 slokas which are engraved in the walls of the temple built by him on the banks of the tank Tatasamudra, which It is also engraved in the main gopura 
he calls in this poem as Ramatataka. on the outer walls in the Hastigiri, and in the shrine of Perundevi Tayar. It is published by Sri Harihara Sastri and Dr. V. Raghavan in the journal of Oriental Research Vol. XVIII Part I 1950. The Ramayana tradition was thus unbroken in the family.

If the Ettur brothers had been along with their family enjoying royal patronage at Vijayanagaram it does not follow that the cousins and kinsmen of these brothers had left Kanchi once for all. Those who remained behind were also the members of the Tatacharya family.. 
Inscriptions are really invaluable for the information they contain on the events and donations recorded during that period. They have value only for that period. Non- mention of these in the inscriptions of other period does not prove that such events did not occur at other times and donations of the same or other kinds were not made, and the persons of the families to which they belonged did not live there. Inscriptions are not diaries to offer day-to- day reports of the occurrences. The Tatacharyas, who were the Rajagurus, did guide their patrons in matters spiritual and also secular in nature. They were guiding the administra- tion of the temple through the persons whom, their patrons appointed, at their direction, to attend to the work of the Srikaryam in the temple. Alakiya Manavala Jiyar was one such person. 
Perfect amity that prevailed then did not restrain the Tatacharyas from choosing him for this post. It will be wrong to suggest that the Tatacharyas changed the Srikaryams out of spite. They had to be replaced because of the need to pay personal attention to the work then undertaken in the temple. This should be sufficient to explain why the Tatacharyas are mentioned in the inscriptions made after the middle of the 16th century. The inscriptions, which were issued occasionally did not therefore refer to the presence of the Tatacharyas at Kanchi before 16th century. Besides, building of the portions, and additions made to the structures in the temple were undertaken only in the 16th century. The Tatacharyas were then at Vellore and Chandragiri nearer to Kanchi. Panchamathabhanjanam Tatadesikan and his illustrious son Lakshmikumara Tatadesikan played a notable part in guiding these constructions. It is worth noting here that the building of the hundred pillared mandapam was begun at the instance of the father and completed during the glorious period of the son. This is not a conjecture. 
xii 
It is also worth noting here that the Tatacharyas had their agents to look after their work in the temple. Ettur Tirumala Kumara Tatacharya is often mentioned in the inscriptions as attending to the work of Srikaryam himself and at times through his agents. There is also mention of one Tiruppani pillai who attended to the construction work in the temple and also to Srikaryam. as the agent of the Tatacharyas. 
Coming to, the contribution made by Sri R. Varada Tata- charya, it must be said that he has wisely divided his work into two parts. In the first part, he prepares the ground for a proper understanding of what he intends to prove and maintain. What is outstanding in this part is the historicity of the positions held by the Tatacharyas in the court of the Vijaya- nagaram rulers. The second part is devoted to a critical examination of the theories, arguments based on them and the conclusions drawn on them by Dr. K. V. Raman. The latter's findings are shown to be unacceptable on the strength of evidence, employing cogent reasonings. Mention must be made here to his well reasoned arguments levelled against Dr. K. V. Raman's treatment of the History of Management in the Post Vijayanagaram period. Why did the Collector ignore the petitions of the Tenkalais and the Stalattars and prefer the Tatacharyas to them? Dr. K. V. Raman does not provide the answer to this question. Sri Varada Tatacharya does offer an explanation to this. In support of this explanation, he brings the entire records comprising correspondences, legal documents and the like which shows that he is guided in these matters by authority and is not swayed, by partisanship and the consequent appeals to emotion. His contribution is indeed admirable. 
The value of Sri Varada Tatacharya's book is high and is made further to rise by the appendage in the form of nearly fourty illustrations all taken from this temple and all of them prominently displaying the Vadakalai sectarian marks. All these are obtained at present in the temple. To one who entertains misgivings about the genuineness of these illustra- tions, the only answer that could be given is to ask him to pay a visit to this temple and verify the true nature of them.

Those who are interested in knowing the way in which the temple developed and how and why the Tatacharya families have been holding it dear to their heart have only to read this book of Sri R. Varada Tatacharya. It will not be an exaggera- tion if this book is said to serve as the source book for further writings on this theme. The author's zeal and enthusiasm in safeguarding the original form, nature and character of this temple have prompted him to devote all his life for the cause of this temple, without ever seeking to get a job for which he is adequately qualified. The Vaishnava community is bound to be grateful to him for making this worthy contribution. 
Dr. V. VARADACHARYA.
