The author Dr. K. V. Raman in his Treatise Varadarajaswami Temple - Kanchi" for a study of its History, Art & Architecture' has taken enormous pains in collecting data both inscriptional and historical as well as traditional for impressing upon his readers, his theory about the religious and historical aspects of this great Vaishnavite Temple. Being a Vaishnavite of the Tenkalai sect, it is no wonder. he gives prominence only to certain Tenkalai features and stories in connection with the Temple, leaving aside the more and most important Vadakalai characteristics of the same. His account of the Temple can be very well described as what they call in legal parlance "Suppressio Veri and Suggestio Falsi". The glaring omissions of certain Vadakalai Shrines festivals and features, while describing all others and the emphasis on certain Tenkalai features and festivals will go to show his bias and sectarian approach. His stories regarding the Tenkalai predominance and theories of their influence are exaggerated and far-fetched. He gives a clever twist to certain inscriptions, and builds a story of Tenkalai domination in the Temple over them. The object of the author in this Treatise seems to be therefore to establish a theory that the Temple of Sri Varadaraja- swami is Tenkalai in character. 
As a true and devout Tenkalai he starts the subject, with a sloka said to have been composed by Sri Manavalamamuni in praise of Lord Varadaraja and throughout the Treatise he gives full prominence to his Acharya by depicting his anecdotes and photos as also that of a stone inscription with a Tenkalai mark. But these illustrations which are intended to highlight the Tenkalai predominance in the Temple will pale into insignificance when compared with the innumerable Vadakalai marks and features in the most prominent and frontal portions, all over the fabric of the Temple. These Vadakalai features and marks will be dealt with in detail with illustrations and photos, in this book at the appropriate places and contexts.

The object of this book is to counter in detail all the fallacious theories and accounts set forth by Dr. K. V. Raman in his Treatise, chapter by chapter. A correct version of the history of the Temple, based on inscriptions, history and tradition handed down to us by our forebears, is given in Part I of this Book. 
The author has also exhibited his lack of personal knowledge in the course of his description and narration of certain items like postures of Alwars, location, festivals, names etc., which will go to show that he is tutored and guided by the staunch leaders of his sect. These fallacies will be also dealt with, in the appropriate contexts. 
The author, in this dissertation, has started propounding the tenets of the Tenkalai-Vadakalai sects based on our Vaishnavite religion and philosophy. We do not know about his qualifications and competence with regard to our religion's scriptures. It is possible that in this also he had had his tuition from the members of his sect who are more qualified and competent. But even here, we are able to see the slant and the sectarian bias in abundance. 
We have based our survey and theories mostly on the puranic and traditional version as found in our religious scriptures handed down to us by our forebears, as far as the general religious themes are concerned. But, for the history of the Tatacharyas and their connection, influence and services in the Temple we have relied purely on history, inscriptions and ancient unassailable records and texts. 
Though we are not presumptuous to claim" perfect know- ledge in our religious literature we shall try to counter the disputable points, the author has raised in his book, to the best of our ability, in our own way, even though both these do not have any relevance to the subject-matter of the "Treatise" in the ultimate analysis. 
It is surprising to see the author's references to certain controversial and sectarian documents and books which he

has evidently taken as the basis for his version. These docu- ments filed in the courts as exhibits by his sect (Tenkalais) during the litigation that raged over our Temple for the last two centuries or more and books written with a bias, should not be brought in, in as much as they present the picture of only one side. Much reliance shall not be placed on them attributing undisputed authenticity to them. At any rate they should not form part of a thesis submitted for the award of the Ph.D. Degree. To a reader who has no correct knowledge of the origin and basis of these documents, the author's references to them would evidently create an impression that these documents and exhibits are genuine. It becomes therefore incumbent on our part to meet the points raised in these documents and exhibits by citing documents which are not only unassailable on the strength of evidences they contain but also because most of them are judicial pronouncements. 
We crave our readers' pardon for certain repetitions which may occur during the course of this "Critical Survey" caused solely on account of similar repetitions occurring in many of the chapters of the "Treatise ". 
Wherever the word "author" occurs in this book, it means Dr. K. V. Raman and wherever the word "we" occurs it is the author of this "Critical Survey 
Critical Survey" and his associates. Wherever the words "Our Temple " or " The Temple" occur, it is Sri Varadarajaswami Temple, and the word "Treatise' occurs, it is the book by the author with the title, "Sri Varadarajaswami Temple - Kanchi".
