No. 34.—CONJEEVERAM INSCRIPTION OF BRAHMA-TANTRA-SVATANTRA-JIYAR: SAKA 1282.

By A. S. RAMANATHA AYYAR, B.A., MADRAS.

## Intro
Kāñchīpuram in the Chingleput District was an important place of pilgrimage from very early times. Portions of this town and its environs were in the olden days known according to their religious associations, as the Buddha-Kāñchī, Jina-Kāñchī, Śiva-Kāñchī and Vishṇu-Kāñchī.[^318_2] The inscription[^318_3] published below is engraved on the north wall of the second *prākāra* of the Varadarāja temple at Little Conjeeveram, otherwise called Vishṇu-Kāñchī, which is very sacred to the Vaishṇavas of the south.

[^318_1]: *Kara-vattin* means also ‘one who is near at hand.’ The statement ‘Vimalaśiva makes most distant people near’ involves contradiction, but it is only apparent, the intended sense being as given above. The figure is *Virōdhābhāsa*.
[^318_2]: Buddha-Kāñchī is referred to in No. 15 of the *Madras Epigraphical collection for 1934-35* (*Annual Report on South Indian Epigraphy*, 1934-35, para. 56). Jina-Kāñchī is represented by Tirupparuttikkuṉṟu near Conjeeveram; Śiva-Kāñchī and Vishṇu-Kāñchī are respectively the modern Big and Little Conjeeveram.
[^318_3]: No. 574 of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1919.

The characters in which the record is engraved are **Tamil** and **Grantha**, the latter being employed for the Sanskrit words. The language is **Tamil** with an admixture of Sanskrit words, and is somewhat illustrative of the type of Vaishṇava composition prevalent in this period and locality. The record is very well preserved, and its orthography does not call for any comment.

The record does not quote any king's name but is simply dated in **Śaka 1282** and contains the astronomical details—**Vikārin, Mēsha, śu. 1, Friday and Aśvati**—which yield the equivalent **A.D. 1359, March 29**. 

### Summary
It states that a certain *Vaishṇavadāsa* who had been given the title of **Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar** by the god (Hastigirīśa), was put in charge of a *maṭha* evidently at Kāñchīpuram in Śaka 1282. This information is of interest for **Vaishṇava religious history**, as it enables us to identify this first pontiff of the *maṭha* with the **direct disciple of the great Vēdānta-Dēśika**, the erudite scholar, keen controversialist and deeply venerated Vaishṇava *āchārya*,[^319_1] whose literary and religious activities are said to have extended over a major portion of the 14th century A.D.

As mentioned above, the inscription does not refer itself to the reign of any king, but it is somewhat peculiarly worded, in that it purports to have been issued by the deity himself. 

In the Tamil records of this temple, the god is called Aruḷāḷapperumāḷ or Tiruvattiyūr-ninṟaruḷiya-Paramasvāmin, or ‘the great Lord who was pleased to stand at Tiruvattiyūr’. The village-name Tiruvattiyūr having been Sanskritised into Hastigiri,[^319_2] the god came to be known to Sanskrit authors as Hastigirīśa, by which name he is referred to in the opening verse of this epigraph. 

### Circumstance & decision
<details><summary>रविलोचनः</summary>

This refers to Tirumalai Srinivasa Tatadesikan , who is referred to in the 3000 gpp as being appointed the srikarya durandara of the Perumal Koil
</details>


It is stated that on the representation made by the agent **Perumāḷtātaṇ** and other *Bhaṭṭas*, the god, while seated in regal pomp with his consorts in the *abhishēka-maṇḍapa* of the temple on the throne named **Vīravallāḷaṇ** under the canopy called the **Ariyeṇavallāṇ-pandal** listening to the chanting of the songs of Śathakōpa, was pleased to confer the title of **Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar** on a certain *Vaishṇavadāsa* and to put him in charge of a *maṭha* and its properties, so that he may propagate the tenets of the **Rāmānuja-darśanam[^319_3]** to the Vaishṇava laity, and maintain the **library** which he had collected, probably in the *maṭha* premises. A sentence at the end adds that this divine order (*tirumugam*) was engraved on stone by the temple-accountant.

### Style
In regard to the particular style of wording in this inscription, couched as if the orders had emanated directly from the deity himself, it may be mentioned that this convention was adopted by some of the Vaishṇava temples in the Tirunelvēli District in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D., and in some instances in the South Arcot and Chingleput Districts also. 


Some Śaiva temples also appear to have sparingly copied this procedure in drafting their documents at this period. In such cases, the occasion when and the place wherefrom the orders[^319_4] were issued are given at some length. Some instances may be quoted.

1. Śakābdam 1463 nāḷ . . . Muḷḷināṭṭu brahmadēyam śrī-Śēravaṇ-mahādēvi-chaturvēdimaṅgalattu vaḍapal śrīmad-Dvārakānāthaṇ aruḷāl Āyiratteṇmaṇ-pandal-kīḻ Vīrakēraḷaṇ-pithattu nāmum nam peṇḍugaḷuḍuṅ kūḍi-irundu, etc.—(*Śērmādēvi*, No. 186 of 1895 of the Madras Epigraphical collection—*S. I. I.*, Vol. V, No. 750).

[^319_1]: Dēśika is believed to have been born in A.D. 1269, Śukla, and to have died in A.D. 1370, Saumya. The present record is of help in confirming the period of his literary activity as the second half of the 14th century A.D.
[^319_2]: The artificial ramp formed by an enclosed *maṇḍapa* is called the ‘*Tirumalai*’ or ‘*giri*’, on top of which the shrine of Varadarāja is located.

[^319_3]: Compare the verse composed in praise of this Jiyar :—
    हस्तीशं लौकिकख्यातं  कौण्डिन्यं विदुषां वरम्।  
    रामानुजार्यसिद्दान्त-स्थापकाचार्यम् आश्रये॥

[^319_4]: This is analogous to the instances in which kings are described as having been seated in particular halls of their palaces and on particular seats, while issuing the orders contained in the respective epigraphs.

### Divine sanction
The reigning king of the time is referred to in these records as *nam piḷḷai* or *nam kumāraṇ* ‘the god's son or favourite’, and in response to his formal petition that a particular transaction may be made, the god is described as sanctioning it and issuing a ratificatory order to that effect to the officials concerned. This convention does not, however, appear to have been in vogue for a long time. 

Ādi-Chaṇḍēśvara, one of the sixty-three Nāyaṇmārs, is considered to be the steward-in-chief (*mūla-bhṛitya*) of Śaiva temples, and the documents relating to them are drafted in his name. Similarly also Vishvaksēna or Sēṇai-mudaliyār is looked upon as the Manager of Vaishṇava temples. It is one step further to assume that the orders were issued directly by the god himself.[^320_1] 

Such divine mandates are called *aruḷappāḍu*; and in the Śrīraṅgam temple, god Raṅgarāja is even now conventionally considered to look after the affairs of his temple himself and issue the necessary orders through the mouth of his temple-officials.

### Expressions
Before proceeding to examine the contents of this record, a few expressions occurring in it may be explained.

(L. 2). **Vīravallāḷaṇ simhāsanam** and **Ariyeṇavallāṇ-pandal** are the names respectively of a throne and a canopy. The first was probably presented to the temple by the Hoysaḷa king **Vīra-Ballāḷa III**,[^320_2] while the second may have been named after some one having the title ‘he who is as powerful as a lion’,[^320_3] but whose title it was is not known.

**Nam peṇḍugaḷ**—viz., Vishṇu's two consorts, Śrī and Bhūmi.

**Śaṭhakōpaṇ-pāṭṭu kēḷāniṟka**—Śaṭhakōpa is the name of the Vaishṇava saint Nammālvār, whose **Tiruvāymoli** is considered equal to the Vēdas in sanctity and is chanted in the presence of the deity on particular occasions. Endowments made for this service in Vishṇu temples are often mentioned in inscriptions.[^320_4]

(L. 3). **Perumāḷtātaṇ**—Perumāḷtātaṇ or Perumāḷdāsaṇ would ordinarily mean ‘a devotee of Perumāḷ (Vishṇu)’; but in this context it appears to have been the name of the agent, supervising the sacred business of the temple (*nam vīṭṭu karumam kēṭkum*), in whose presence and that of the **Bhaṭṭas** of the temple, the order is stated to have been promulgated.

[^320_1]: In these instances, the records commence with a Sanskrit verse specifying that the orders emanate from the god himself—
    (a) सर्वलोकसमुत्पत्तिस्थितिसंहारकारणम्।
    शासनं शाश्वतं शम्भोः श्रीवीरेड्वस्थितिविद्यते॥—No. 127 of 1894 of the Madras Epigraphical collection.
    (b) एतत्त्रैलोक्यनिर्माणत्राणसंहारकारणम्।
    श्रीमद्रेश्वरनाथस्य शासनं शाश्वतं परम्॥—No. 51 of 1938-39 of the same collection.
[^320_2]: Ballāḷa III was camping at Kāñchīpuram in Bhāvaka (Śaka 1256)—No. 401 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection. In two other records from the same temple, one of which is dated in Śaka 1283, in the regime of Sāḷuva Maṅgu, the god is described as seated in a similar manner while issuing the orders.
[^320_3]: A liquid measure called ‘Ariyeṇavallāṇ-nāḷi’ was current in this temple at this period—(No. 343 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection).
[^320_4]: *Madras Epigraphical Report for 1908*, part II, para. 35.

[Page 321]

The name ‘Vaishṇavadāsa’ occurring in the same line has to be considered as meaning ‘the servant-devotee of Vaishṇavas’ rather than as the personal name of the donee in the record; for according to the *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*, the original name of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar was **Pēraruḷāḷayyaṇ of Vīravalli**[^321_1] and his *dāsyānāma* on becoming a *saṁnyāsin* was **Pēraruḷāḷa-Jiyar**.

(L. 4). **Samārādhaṇam aḍukku vēṇḍum muṭṭukkaḷum**—seems to refer to the worship to be conducted to the deities kept in the *maṭha* itself and the requirements therefor. It is usual for every *maṭha* to have images of some deities for worship. 

In this connection, it may be noted that on the eve of the demise of Vēdānta-Dēśika, some images are said to have been bequeathed to his disciple Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar.[^321_2]

**Postakaṅgaḷum idukku vēṇḍum upakaraṇaṅgaḷum**—By *postakaṅgaḷ* (*pustaka*), manuscript bundles are apparently meant. The *upakaraṇas* are the accessories and paraphernalia required for running a library—such as probably racks for the accommodation of the manuscript bundles, spare sets of cadjan leaves for copying work, and stylus and other scribal apparatus.

**Rāmānuja-darśanam**—is the Viśishṭādvaita-siddhānta as codified and expounded in his *Śrī-bhāshya* by the great Vaishṇava apostle Rāmānuja (A.D. 1017-1137). It was he who had raised this system to an unassailable eminence and had arranged for its propagation in true missionary style, by the training of a number of able exponents and *siṁhāsanādhipatis*[^321_3] from among his numerous disciples.

(L. 5) **Nam Rāmānuja-uḍaiyārum nam samayattil uḷḷārum**—Rāmānuja-uḍaiyār appears to mean the ‘followers of Rāmānuja.’[^321_4] The idea seems to be that the selection of Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar as the pontiff was to receive the acceptance of Rāmānuja's followers and the Vaishṇava laity (*samayattil-uḷḷār*).

(L. 6) **Ivanukku nam muḍittapaḍiyum uḍuttapaḍiyum pūśina-paḍiyum kuḍuttōm**—means that the flowers worn by the god, the clothes used by him and the sandal-paste and unguents utilised for his worship were presented to the Jiyar as a mark indicative of the god's love to the recipient. This expression is found used in some inscriptions[^321_5] and in Vaishṇava literature.

### Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar
As regards Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the donee of the record, some information is available from Vaishṇava literature. Among the South Indian religions, it was Vaishṇavism alone that had developed the ‘historical sense’ to an appreciable extent, and there are therefore several biographies of the Vaishṇava *āchāryas* available, collated under the names of *Vaibhavas* and *Guruparamparās* of varying volume.[^321_6] One such work dealing with the life of the great Vaishṇava reformer **Vēdānta-Dēśika** is the *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*[^321_7] in Tamil prose by Tritīya-Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar.

[^321_1]: *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam* (Tamil, Madras,), p. 114; see also f. n. 3 on p. 319.
[^321_2]: *Ibid.*, p. 138.
[^321_3]: There were 74 *siṁhāsanādhipatis* who were selected. Their names are given in the reply to question No. 24 of the *Trimśatpraśnōttaram, Palaṇadai-viḷakkam*, p. 30.
[^321_4]: The following expression from No. 51 of 1938-39 from Śrīraṅgam may be compared—*Kodavar kōvaṇavar nam bhaṭṭakaḷ . . . nam Rāmānujaṇ-uḍaiyār nam pādūvār*, etc.
[^321_5]: Compare No. 567 of 1919 of the Madras Epigraphical collection.
[^321_6]: There are many biographies of Dēśika available. The *Vēdānta-Dēśika-vaibhava-prakāśikā* by Doḍḍayāchārya is in Sanskrit.
[^321_7]: Published in Madras in several editions. **Dvitīya-Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar**, the *āchārya* of the author of this work is said to have written the *Pannirāyirappaḍi-Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*, which is not extant.

[Page 322]

From it we gather the following details about Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar, the first of that name, who was a disciple of Vēdānta-Dēśika :

**Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar** belonged to the Kauṇḍinya-gōtra and was originally called **Vīravalli Pēraruḷāḷayyaṇ**. Well-versed in all the *śāstras*, he became an ardent disciple of Dēśika and assumed the *saṁnyāsa* garb under the name of **Pēraruḷāḷa-Jiyar**. 

When the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam was looted by the Muhammadans in the first quarter of the 14th century, Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar fled along with his *āchārya* to Satyamangalam (in the Coimbatore District) and returned to Śrīraṅgam only after some years. 

He was taught the *Bhagavad-vishayam* (*Ārāyirappaḍi*) by Varadāchārya alias **Nayiṇārāchārya**, the son and disciple of Vēdānta-Dēśika, in **Kali 4440, Bahudhānya, Āvaṇi, śu. 2, Hasta (=A.D. 1338, August 18)**. 

On one occasion, he vanquished a pandit of North India in a polemical contest at Śrīraṅgam and was honoured by Dēśika with the title of ‘**Brahma-tantra-svatantra**’[^322_1] ‘he who is a master in Brahma-tantra’. That accounts for the origin of the name by which he was popularly known. 

On another occasion during the régime of **Tirumalai-Śrīnivāsāchārya**[^322_2] who had been installed by Dēśika as the *Śrīkārya-dhurandhara* of the Kāñchīpuram temple, Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar overcame a Kashmīrian Pandit in a philosophical discussion and earned the title of ‘**Paryāya-Bhāshyakāra**’.[^322_3] 

Some time later under the direction of god Veṅkaṭēśa in a dream, he accepted the **Trusteeship of the Tirupati temple**. He stayed at Tirupati for a long time expounding the Vaishṇava philosophy to his disciples. 

### Succession
After his demise he was succeeded by Pēraruḷāḷayyaṇ-Appai. **Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar was the author of two small works**—the *Divyasūri-stuti*[^322_4] and the *Āchāryāvatāra-ghaṭṭārtha*.[^322_5]

[^322_1]: The present record conventionally states that god himself gave the title.
[^322_2]: *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*, p. 138. He was the author of a religious work called the *Prabandha-nirvāham*.
[^322_3]: A verse composed by Ghaṭikāśatakam-Ammāḷ in praise of this Jiyar reads—
    पर्यायभाष्यकाराय प्रवृत्ताय विभूतये।
    ब्रह्मतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राय द्वितीयाब्रह्मणे नमः॥
[^322_4]: The colophon reads—ब्रह्मतन्त्रस्वतन्त्राढ्य द्विव्यमूरिस्तुतिः।
[^322_5]: Its colophon reads—ब्रह्मतन्त्रस्वतन्त्रेण परकालयतीन्द्रुना। आचार्यावतारघट्टार्थ संक्षेपण प्रकाश्यते॥

---

[Page 323]

The *maṭha* which was thus started at Kāñchīpuram under the pontificate of this Brahma-tantra-svatantra-Jiyar in **A.D. 1360** grew in importance and appears to have latterly removed its headquarters to **Mēlkōṭe** in the Mysore State, where it became popular under the name of the **Parakāla-maṭha**.[^323_2]

### Other maTha-s
At about this time in Śaka 1300 there was in the Varadarāja temple at Kāñchīpuram, a minor *maṭha* called the Vēda-maṭha.[^323_4] 

Another important Vaishṇava *maṭha* which came into existence in this period was the Ahōbalam-maṭha,[^323_5] whose founder Śrīnivāsa is believed to have assumed the *Saṁnyāsāśrama* in **Śaka 1320 (A.D. 1398)** under the name of **Ādivaṇ Śaṭhakōpa-Jiyar**.

### Śiṅgabhūpāla
Vēdānta-Dēśika is stated in the *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam* to have been the contemporary of a certain Telugu chief named **Sarvajña-Śiṅgabhūpāla** and to have composed the *Subhāshita-nīvī* for his delectation.[^323_6] According to the *Velugōṭivāri-vaṁśāvaḷi*[^323_7] dealing with the history of the **Rēcherla chiefs**, there were three chiefs of the name of Śiṅga. Of these, **Śiṅga III** who came to power in **A.D. 1425** had the title of **Sarvajña**.[^323_8] The author of the work on rhetoric called the *Rasārṇava-sudhākara*[^323_9] was a Śiṅga, son of an Annavōta; and he has been identified with **Śiṅga II** and has been assigned to about **A.D. 1380**.[^323_10]

[^323_1]: In this connection the following orthodox three-fold ‘lists’ may be noted : (a) **Mantrārtha-guruparamparā**... (b) **Śrībhāshya-guruparamparā**... (c) **Bhagavad-vishaya-guruparamparā**...
[^323_2]: See *Palaṇadai-viḷakkam*, Part II, p. 28.
[^323_3]: Published in the Mysore Sanskrit Series.
[^323_4]: No. 32 of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1890—*S. I. I.*, Vol. IV, No. 355.
[^323_5]: Vide *Tirupati Dēvasthānam Report* (1930), p. 214, where these traditional dates are questioned.
[^323_6]: *Guruparamparā-prabhāvam*, pp. 120 and 139.
[^323_7]: Dr. N. Venkataramanayya, *Velugōṭivāri-vaṁśāvaḷi*, Introduction.
[^323_8]: Vasantarāya, brother of the latter Śiṅga III, made a gift of four *dvārapālaka* images to the Varadarāja temple (No. 683 of 1919) in Śaka 1359.
[^323_9]: श्रीमदभूमण्डलाधीश्वर-प्रतिगण्डभैरव-श्रीमावोतरेन्द्रनन्दन-भूमण्डलमौलि-श्रीमिङ्गभूपाल-विरचितं रसार्णवसुधाकरं—
[^323_10]: His date has been discussed in *Śṛiṅgāra-Śrīīāthamu* (Telugu) by Prabhākara Śāstri, p. 179, etc.

---

[Page 324]

It is no doubt tempting to identify the author of the *Rasārṇava-sudhākara*, with the chief who honoured the two *āchāryas*.[^324_1] As Vēdānta-Dēśika is believed to have passed away in **A.D. 1370**,[^324_2] and as Nayiṇārāchārya had also attained to literary fame before A.D. 1360, their contemporary has been considered to have been **Śiṅga I of A.D. 1360** or **Śiṅga II**.

The existence of one other Śiṅga at this period may also be noted. In the Śrīraṅgam plates of **Mummaḍi-Nāyaka**[^324_3] dated in **Śaka 1280**, only two years earlier than the date of the present record. This chief's father was a **Kūna**. But the chief, to whom Dēśika[^324_4] had dedicated the three works referred to above, is said to have been the son of a **Mādhavā-Nāyaka**.

### Library culture
Another point of interest in this epigraph is the reference to a **collection of manuscripts** (or a library) which was kept in the *maṭha*. It is well-known that in the medieval centuries, religious institutions of all denominations flourished in South India. They were left in charge of the heads of these *maṭhas* called ***Maṭhādhipatis, Mudaliyārs* or *Jiyars***. Then there were also the ***Ghaṭikāsthānas***.

[^324_1]: Mr. M. Somasekhara Sarma has kindly brought to my notice a reference... assigned to a period before A. D. 1370.
[^324_2]: The Sanskrit verses engraved in the Śrīraṅgam temple... are stated in the *Guruparamparā* to have been composed by Dēśika himself.
[^324_3]: *Ante*, Vol. XIV, p. 84 and *Annual Report on Epigraphy*, Madras, for 1913, pp. 129-30.
[^324_4]: *Life and Literary Writings of Dēśika*, by M. K. Tātāchārya, where the following is quoted—
    इदमिति निजमानन्दैकमेकेन प्रतिसमदिशत् माधवात्मजस्य ।

---

[Page 325]

Maintenance of these institutions are recorded in several inscriptions;[^325_1] it is reasonable to infer that when these *maṭhas, ghaṭikās* and *pāṭhaśālās* were functioning properly, they must have been maintaining well-stocked libraries.

A record of the Western Chāḷukya king Trailōkyamalla-Āhavamalla dated in **Śaka 980 (=A.D. 1058)** from **Nāgai**[^325_2] mentions a gift of land for the maintenance of six Curators called ***Sarasvatī-Bhaṇḍārigas***. Another interesting reference to a **Sarasvatī-bhaṇḍāra** or library is found in a fragmentary epigraph[^325_3] from Śrīraṅgam. 

The *Paushkara-Saṁhitā*[^325_4] gives rules for the formation of a library in a temple. The Śrīraṅgam library was mentioned in a 14th year inscription[^325_5] (A.D. 1269). A **pustaka-bhaṇḍāra** at **Śṛiṅgēri** is mentioned in two epigraphs[^325_6] from the early Vijayanagara period (Śaka 1328 and 1354).
